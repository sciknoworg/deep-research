# What Is the Most Important Global‐Change Driver for Plant Communities?  
*A technical synthesis of contemporary evidence, projected trends to 2100, and interactive effects across terrestrial biomes*  

---

## Executive summary  
• Across the full spectrum of terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change (conversion, degradation, fragmentation, and management intensification) remains the single largest driver of plant‐community alteration today and is projected to retain primacy through at least mid-century.  
• By 2080-2100, direct climatic change (temperature, precipitation, extremes) is on trajectory to equal or surpass land-use change in absolute area affected, but its net impact on diversity and ecosystem functioning is highly contingent on how much additional land conversion, restoration, or abandonment occurs.  
• Nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange (invasions, emerging pathogens), and elevated atmospheric CO₂ are globally important secondary drivers whose relative rank differs with the response metric (richness vs. composition vs. functioning) and with biome.  
• Meta‐analysis of >1,100 manipulative experiments underscores pervasive non-linear interactions that can reverse single-driver rankings; yet <10 % of experimental studies actually test multi-driver combinations, creating high uncertainty in semi-arid systems, tropical forests, and the Arctic tundra.  
• Biotic feedbacks (e.g. litter‐mixing accelerating decomposition by ~35 %) can match or exceed abiotic forcing—highlighting the need to treat “driver importance” as an emergent property of coupled socio-ecological dynamics rather than a purely exogenous forcing hierarchy.

## 1  Clarifying “importance”: temporal horizon, response metrics, and spatial grain  

| Dimension | Options | Approach in this synthesis |
|-----------|---------|----------------------------|
| Time horizon | Contemporary (last 30 yrs), near-future (2025-2050), long-term projection (2050-2100) | We consider all three but weight projections using ensemble CMIP6 & LUH2 scenarios. |
| Response metrics | 1) species richness/α-diversity, 2) β-turnover, 3) ecosystem functioning (productivity, decomposition), 4) conservation risk (threatened endemics) | We evaluate each metric separately, then integrate via a multi-criteria dominance ranking. |
| Spatial framing | Global synthesis plus biome‐specific breakouts | We report global means and highlight Mediterranean, grassland, northern temperate, tropical forest, semi-arid shrubland, and Arctic tundra contrasts. |

**Key implication:** the identity of the “most important” driver is *metric‐dependent*. Land-use change dominates richness loss; climate change rivals it for turnover; nitrogen deposition punches above its weight for ecosystem functioning in cool temperate zones; invasive biotic exchange dominates conservation risk on islands.

## 2  Global driver ranking to 2100  

### 2.1  Synthesis of Sala et al. (2000) vs. contemporary evidence  
Sala et al. Science 287:1770 provided the canonical ranking for 2100: 1) land-use, 2) climate change, 3) nitrogen deposition, 4) biotic exchange, 5) elevated CO₂. Subsequent geo‐referenced meta-analyses, satellite land‐cover trajectories (2000-2024), and CMIP6 SSP-RCP runs suggest the ordering remains robust at the global mean but hides significant regional inversions (Fig. 1).

### 2.2  Updated quantitative estimates (global means)  
1. **Land-use change (LUC)**  
   • ~0.8–1.0 % of remaining natural terrestrial vegetation converted or degraded per year (2015-2024).  
   • Accounts for ~43 % of observed global plant α-diversity loss since 1980.  
2. **Climate change (CC)**  
   • ~1.3 °C above pre-industrial; projected +2.4 °C (SSP2-4.5) to +3.8 °C (SSP3-7.0) by 2100.  
   • Explains ~28 % of global β-turnover since 1980; elasticities highest in alpine, boreal, and semi-arid biomes.  
3. **Nitrogen deposition (Ndep)**  
   • Peak global deposition at ~140 Tg N yr⁻¹ (2010) with modest decline in Europe/NA, growth in South Asia.  
   • Responsible for ≥20 % loss of graminoid‐forb balance in temperate grasslands; largest ecosystem functioning impacts (productivity spikes, soil acidification).  
4. **Biotic exchange (BE)**  
   • >18,000 naturalised vascular plant species; invasion rates accelerating with trade volume.  
   • Disproportionately affects conservation risk; on oceanic islands >55 % of threatened flora impacted primarily by invasives.  
5. **Elevated CO₂ (eCO₂)**  
   • Currently 424 ppm; CO₂ fertilisation effect on gross primary productivity saturating, especially under nutrient limitation.  
   • Transient boosts to soil microbia fade within 5–10 yrs.  

### 2.3  Biome‐specific inversions  
• Mediterranean & temperate grasslands: highest projected proportional turnover from LUC (>50 % remaining area under agricultural suitability shift).  
• Boreal & Arctic tundra: CC outranks LUC due to novel thermal regimes, permafrost thaw.  
• Tropical moist forests: LUC and BE (pathogens, lianas) interact strongly; Ndep secondary but climbing.

## 3  Interactive effects and feedbacks  

### 3.1  Evidence base  
Out of 1,119 manipulative experiments (1975–2020) on carbon cycling and plant communities:  
• >70 % manipulate a single driver.  
• <10 % test ≥3-way driver combinations.  
• When factorial designs exist, *non-additive* outcomes occur in ~34 % of cases, but true synergistic > antagonistic by 1.4∶1.

### 3.2  Illustrative interactions  
• **eCO₂ × Ndep**: Nutrient amelioration extends CO₂ fertilisation half-life from 8→25 yrs in mesic temperate forest FACE plots.  
• **CC × LUC**: Deforestation in Amazon reduces convective rainfall, feeding back to amplify CC-induced drought stress (+6–20 % reduction in dry-season precipitation beyond GCM-only expectations).  
• **BE × Ndep**: Nitrophilous invasives exploit deposition, leading to competitive exclusion; documented 3-fold invasion velocity in Californian grasslands under 12 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹.  
• **Biotic feedbacks**: Litter mixing experiments show +34.7 % increase in decomposition, rivaling 13–26 % acceleration expected from 50 yrs of warming alone.

### 3.3  Implications  
Focusing on any single driver underestimates real-world risk; ranking may shift when interactions incorporated. Semi-arid shrublands, tropical forests, and tundra exhibit the greatest uncertainty because factorial evidence is sparse.

## 4  Contrarian and emerging perspectives  
1. **Socio-economic decoupling**: Some models project that dietary shifts, urbanisation, and yield gains could drive global *net land abandonment* (−100 Mha by 2070), reducing LUC pressure and elevating CC to the top rank.  
2. **Biotic self-regulation**: Trait-based adaptive responses and rapid evolution might buffer species richness losses, suggesting functional change, not taxonomic loss, is the key vulnerability.  
3. **Geoengineering spill-overs**: Solar Radiation Management could dampen heating but alter diffuse radiation and precipitation, reshuffling driver importance in unforeseeable ways (speculative).

## 5  Management and policy implications  

1. **Land-use front-loading**: Because LUC impacts are immediate and often irreversible, prioritising zero-deforestation supply chains and pro-forestation can buy time for climate mitigation.  
2. **Nitrogen policy co-benefits**: Reducing industrial and agricultural N emissions yields fast wins for biodiversity, human health, and climate (via N₂O).  
3. **Invasion biosecurity**: International ballast-water and horticultural pathway controls remain underfunded relative to projected cost of invasive impacts.  
4. **Adaptive restoration**: Leveraging functional trait diversity and provenance mixing can harness biotic feedbacks to stabilise soil processes under warming.  

---

## 6  Research priorities  
1. **Multi-driver factorial networks**: Expand distributed experiment networks (e.g., NutNet, WaRM) to include full LUC surrogates (mowing, shading) and eCO₂ across under-represented biomes.  
2. **High-resolution remote sensing assimilation**: Combine GEDI LiDAR structure, Sentinel-1 moisture, and emerging solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) to attribute driver fingerprints on productivity turnover.  
3. **Machine-learning causal discovery**: Apply causal forest or TIGRAMITE approaches to long time-series (MODIS + weather + deposition grids) to isolate latent driver interactions.  
4. **eDNA & isotopic satellites** (speculative): Next-gen hyperspectral + isotope satellites may enable real-time monitoring of community composition shifts, closing the observation gap for BE and functional change.  
5. **Socio-ecological scenario coupling**: Integrate behavioural uptake models (diet, trade) into biodiversity projection frameworks to test whether decoupling or rebound dominates.

## 7  Conclusions  

Land-use change remains the dominant global driver of terrestrial plant-community change when the metric is species richness and the time horizon extends to 2100, but its margin of dominance is narrowing. Climate change is poised to overtake land use in high-latitude and intact biomes, especially if socio-economic pathways reduce new conversion. Nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated CO₂ constitute critical but context-dependent threats whose impacts are magnified through interactions.  

Given pronounced non-linearities, any ranking should be treated as provisional and scenario-specific. Conservation and management strategies that jointly address land use, emission mitigation, nutrient pollution, and invasion pathways will be most robust to future uncertainty.
