# Fertilization Effects on Grassland Plant Diversity — A Synthetic Assessment

*Prepared for an expert readership | 2 June 2025*

---

## 1  Executive summary

• The single most ubiquitous response of grassland vegetation to nutrient enrichment is a **decline in taxonomic α‐diversity (species richness)**, typically in the range of **−10 to −50 %** after 5–20 years of chronic inputs.  
• Magnitude, pace and even sign of diversity change depend strongly on (i) the **element added (N vs P)**, (ii) **dose and temporal pattern** (constant low-rate vs pulses), (iii) **climatic context (cool vs warm summers, aridity)**, (iv) **soil-buffering capacity (pH, CEC, organic matter)** and (v) **co-occurring management (grazing, mowing, liming, irrigation)**.  
• Beyond species counts, fertilization consistently erodes **compositional turnover (β-diversity)** and **spatio-temporal insurance effects**, thereby weakening ecosystem stability even where richness loss is modest.  
• Negative impacts are **partially reversible or avoidable** through (a) manure-only regimes at moderate N loads (~70 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹), (b) maintaining **high inter-annual variability** in intensity, (c) **elemental balancing (liming, micronutrients)**, and (d) **retaining or introducing disturbance agents** (low-stocking sheep, fire, intermittent mowing) to counter competitive exclusion.

## 2  Clarifying the analytical frame

| Dimension | Recommended stance for a general synthesis |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Facet of diversity** | Report both **species richness** (α, β, γ) and **evenness‐weighted indices** (Shannon, Simpson) plus, where data allow, **functional and phylogenetic diversity** to expose non-random loss of traits/lineages. |
| **Biome scope** | Provide an **all-grassland overview** while flagging biome-specific modifiers (temperate, tropical, alpine, semi-arid). |
| **Fertilizer taxonomy** | Disentangle **N‐only, P-only, NP, organic manures, biosolids** and their rates; lumping masks key asymmetries (e.g., P-only in N-limited tropics is often benign). |

## 3  Mechanistic pathways linking nutrients to diversity

1. **Competitive exclusion** — added N or P relieves limitation for fast-growing grasses/forbs that monopolise light; shade-tolerant yet slow species are out-competed (Park Grass, UK).  
2. **Soil acidification & cation leaching** — ammoniacal N forms (NH₄⁺) drive pH < 4.5, mobilising Al³⁺ and disadvantaging calcicoles; liming partly mitigates.  
3. **Biomass overproduction** — tall swards increase litter and reduce seedling recruitment niches; mowing/grazing disturbance re-opens space.  
4. **Microbial feedbacks** — fertilization alters microbial C:N ratio, suppressing specific respiration (Jena); shifts nitrifier/denitrifier guilds, changing N cycling and plant–soil feedbacks.  
5. **Stability erosion** — reduced species asynchrony under nutrient‐rich, productivity-dominated communities amplifies temporal variance in biomass (Hautier et al.).

## 4  Empirical patterns (synthesising all provided learnings)

### 4.1  Pan-continental meta-signals

• A synthesis of 42 temperate-mountain studies (134 effect sizes) shows each **10 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ or one extra application year** drives an *additive* species-richness drop.  
• Low-dose, long-term fertilization ultimately matches the biodiversity loss of high-dose pulses, underscoring **cumulative load** as the relevant currency.

### 4.2  European temperate grasslands

• Across **1,514 German 16 m² plots**, *any* fertilization reduced mean richness by **15 %** and Shannon diversity by **0.1 units**. Sheep grazing buffered the effect (+27 % richness relative to cattle).  
• Park Grass and Palace Leas 65–120-year experiments confirm >50 % richness loss under continuous N (NH₄)₂SO₄; liming restores only ∼30 % of lost species.  
• A 27-year UK study found **farmyard manure (FYM, 72 kg N)** strikes the best biodiversity–forage compromise; FYM + NPK high load (97 kg N) is worst.  
• High **inter‐annual variation** in fertilization/grazing/mowing intensity (German 150-site survey) boosted *rare species multidiversity* from 18 % to 31 % of regional maximum—suggesting **temporal heterogeneity** as a mitigation lever.

### 4.3  Tropical & subtropical systems

• Brazilian Campos: **249 kg P ha⁻¹ over 16 yrs** raised biomass 30 % while *not* reducing richness (19–24 spp.), because N remained limiting; shows P-only can be biodiversity-neutral where N scarcity persists.  
• Drained peat grassland (NL): already N-rich; adding **K + P** triggered the diversity crash, not further N, highlighting **context-dependent limiting nutrient**.

### 4.4  Semi-arid and alpine contexts

• Seed-addition x nutrient x water factorial in a semi-arid gradient: **nutrients + water** let fertile-soil dominants invade poor soils, homogenising communities (β-diversity loss). Water alone did nothing—illustrates *multiple driver synergy*.

### 4.5  Soil microbial community responses

• China 20-year sites: inorganic N in high-rainfall acidic soils depressed bacterial diversity; organic inputs were gentler. Taxa Nitrosospira/Nitrososphaera flagged as **synthetic-N responders**, Chitinophagaceae/Bacilli as **organic responders**.

## 5  Quantitative synopsis of effect sizes

| Context | Median ΔSpecies Richness | Time span | Loading (N equiv.) | Notes |
|---------|-------------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------|
| Temperate mountain meta-study | −1.6 species per 10 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ | 3–15 yrs | 0–150 kg N | Linear cumulative effect |
| 1,514 German grasslands | −15 % (≈−4 species/16 m²) | Cross-sectional | Binary fert/none | Sheep vs cattle modulates |
| Park Grass (120 yrs) | −50–60 % | Century-scale | 96 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ | pH < 4.5 crucial |
| Brazilian P-addition | +0 (no loss) | 16 yrs | 0 N, 249 kg P | N-limited system |
| German temporal heterogeneity | +13 % rare-species score | 9 yrs heterogeneity window | variable | Variability benefits |

## 6  Diversity facets beyond richness

1. **Evenness** routinely declines faster than richness; dominance curves steepen.  
2. **Functional diversity**: graminoid (C₃) vs forb balance tilts to grasses under N; legume abundance rises only when P co-added or nodulation freed from N scarcity.  
3. **Phylogenetic diversity**: losses biased toward ancient lineages (e.g., small rosettes, geophytes) sensitive to shade.  
4. **β-diversity**: nutrient enrichment homogenises communities across space via dominance of a few nitrophilous species; temporal β also declines.  
5. **Insurance/stability**: even small richness losses translate into **25–35 % declines in biomass stability** because nutrient enrichment synchronises species dynamics.

## 7  Fertilizer form, rate and timing

• **Synthetic N (NH₄NO₃, (NH₄)₂SO₄)** — greatest acidification, fastest diversity loss.  
• **P-only** — neutral to positive in N-limited tropics but negative where N is ample.  
• **N + P synergism** — triggers the steepest competitive exclusion (FYM + NPK case).  
• **Organic manures/biosolids** — supply C, micronutrients, raise pH; biodiversity decline roughly *half* that of synthetic N at the same N rate.  
• **Pulsed vs constant** — constant low doses accumulate to equal biodiversity loss of pulses. Pulsed regimes, however, can allow *temporal refugia* if rest years are long enough.

## 8  Moderating factors & interactions

| Factor | Direction of moderation | Mechanism |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Climate — cooler summers** | Dampens richness loss | Lower growth rates slow competitive exclusion |
| **Grazing by light, mobile herbivores (sheep)** | Buffers | Canopy opening, dung nutrient redistribution |
| **High pH buffering (calcareous soils, liming)** | Buffers | Counteracts acid stress |
| **Inter-annual management variability** | Buffers | Promotes species with differing life-history timing |
| **Water addition in arid sites** | Exacerbates | Removes second limitation, fosters homogenisation |

## 9  Management implications and mitigation portfolio

1. **Adopt moderate, manure-only fertilization (≤ 70 kg N)** where production targets allow.  
2. **Stagger nutrient inputs** (skip-years, rotational patches) to recreate temporal heterogeneity observed to lift rare-species multidiversity.  
3. **Pair fertilization with disturbance** (targeted mowing, light sheep grazing, periodic fire) to prevent litter build-up and open recruitment niches.  
4. **Monitor soil pH**; maintain >5.0 via liming to avert the irreversible acidification seen in century-scale experiments.  
5. **Context-specific element balancing**: in N-saturated peatlands, restrain P; in P-deficient savannas, cautious P addition may boost yield without diversity penalty.  
6. **Integrate microbial indicators** (Nitrosospira vs Chitinophagaceae ratios) for early detection of deleterious nutrient loading trajectories.  
7. **Leverage functional seed additions** in restored areas but avoid concurrent high fertilization that nullifies trait-based niche partitioning.

## 10  Research gaps & speculative fronts (flagged as such)

*Speculative*  
• Harnessing **precision nutrient delivery via drone-sprayed micro-patches** could mimic natural heterogeneity, retaining diversity while sustaining yield.  
• Synthetic biology approaches to engineer **slow-release, pH-neutral N carriers** may decouple production from acidification.  
• Exploring **soil-microbiome transplantation** to buffer fertilized sites against diversity loss remains untested at scale.  
• Climate-change interactions: rising CO₂ may shift N vs P limitation, altering future fertilization–diversity trade-offs.

## 11  Conclusions

Across the weight of evidence spanning >150 years of experimentation and hundreds of landscapes, the **most common effect of fertilization on grassland plant diversity is a reduction in species richness and evenness**, driven by competitive exclusion and soil chemical change. The outcome, however, is *not deterministic*: rate, nutrient identity, temporal pattern and interacting management practices can halve or reverse the biodiversity cost. Designing fertilization regimes that **embrace spatial–temporal heterogeneity, favour organic inputs, and maintain soil pH** emerges as the most robust strategy to reconcile agricultural production with the conservation of grassland biodiversity.
