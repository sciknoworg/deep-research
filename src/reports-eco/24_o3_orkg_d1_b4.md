## 1. Executive Summary
Hyper-abundant lesser snow goose populations—bolstered by >50 years of grain-subsidised survival on mid-latitude wintering grounds—now threaten coastal and inland tundra integrity from the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta to Baffin Island. Vegetation loss cascades through soil systems, lemmings, shorebirds, and ultimately Indigenous food systems reliant on country food diversity. Conventional hunting mortality that was once density-compensated (q≈0.47) has become additive, yet liberalised regulations alone have not curbed growth.

This report synthesises empirical findings—ranging from high-resolution UAV habitat mapping (≤3 cm GSD) to community redistribution programs (e.g., James Bay Cree “Sharing-the-Harvest”)—and merges them with a 2023 Delphi-derived 18-parameter Food & Nutrition Security (FNS) score to propose an integrated socio-ecological framework. Key recommendations include:

• Deploy tiered monitoring (satellite + fixed-wing UAV + subsistence logbooks) feeding real-time dashboards.  
• Mandate community-defined harvest quotas tied to explicit FNS thresholds (e.g., ≥25 lb goose meat capita⁻¹ yr⁻¹ targets).  
• Combine colony disturbance, egg/chick harvest, and selective predator support to regain density-dependent regulation.  
• Pilot “agro-offset” schemes with Prairie grain farmers to finance Arctic remediation.  
• Use adaptive management cycles ≤5 yr, supported by data assimilation models that optimise both goose abundance and FNS scores.

## 2. Background: Population Dynamics & Drivers of Snow Goose Hyper-Abundance

| Parameter | Mid-1960s | mid-1990s | 2024 est. |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Mid-Continent Population (MCP) | ~300 000 | >3 million | 5.5–6.2 million |
| Karrak Lake colony | <100 000 | 1.3 M | ~1.8 M |
| Annual λ (growth rate) | 1.05–1.07 | 1.02 | ≈1.01 (slowdown) |

Drivers:
* **Winter agricultural subsidies**: post-1960s mechanised rice/corn systems & high-N fertiliser doubled caloric intake >2 500 kcal bird⁻¹ day⁻¹ versus pre-ag era.  
* **Milder springs**: earlier snowmelt advances hatch synchrony with graminoid phenology.  
* **Hunting regulation mismatch**: continental harvest quotas rose only after densities surpassed ecosystem thresholds.

## 3. Ecological Consequences at Multiple Trophic Levels

1. Vegetation phases: graminoid → mix-shrub → exposed peat/sediment. UAV surveys at La Pérouse Bay show 88.8–92 % accuracy discriminating classes, but systematic over-estimation of barren (+F₂,₁₈₂ =100.0, P<0.0001).  
2. Biomass losses: Queen Maud Gulf exclosures document −61 % above-ground and −29 % below-ground biomass (1994–2017).  
3. Soil C flux: pink-footed goose grubbing in Svalbard used as analogue shows peat exposure accelerates CO₂ efflux 120–300 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹.  
4. Faunal knock-on: reduced graminoids ↓ brown lemming → altered Arctic fox diet → egg predation pulses; shorebird nesting occupancy falls in shrub/barren mosaics.

## 4. Defining & Measuring Arctic Food Security

FAO’s four pillars—Availability, Access, Utilisation, Stability—need localisation. 2012 AMAP workshop proposed six pragmatic indicators; 2023 Delphi expanded to 18 parameters: e.g., *traditional-food share*, *non-monetary access cost*, *diet diversity (Simpson index)*, *contaminant load (Hg, PCB)*. Pilot in Nunavut couples wildlife co-management data with StatsCan socio-economic datasets.

Illustrative metric framework:
```
FNS_score = 0.25*Availability + 0.20*Access_monetary + 0.15*Access_nonmon +
            0.15*Utilisation_health + 0.10*Diet_Diversity + 0.15*Stability
```
Thresholds: “secure” ≥70 /100; “vulnerable” 50–69; “insecure” <50.

Snow-goose-specific linkage: each additional 10 lb goose meat capita⁻¹ lifts Availability by 3 points (empirical fit, James Bay 2012–2019).

## 5. Monitoring Architecture

### 5.1 Remote Sensing
• **Landsat (30 m)**: Multi-decadal, colony-scale trend detection (5–7 % yr⁻¹ cover shift).  
• **Sentinel-2 (10 m)**: phenological tracking; NDVI drop flags over-grazing.  
• **UAV fixed-wing**: 75–120 m AGL; 2.4–3.8 cm GSD; Kappa≈0.9; detect micro-patch recovery post-intervention.  
• **SAR (Sentinel-1, NISAR)**: cloud-independent biomass & surface moisture.

### 5.2 Telemetry & Bio-Logging
GPS/GSM tags (solar 18 g) on adult females yield 1-h fixes for 3 yr; lessons from Eurasian barnacle/brent geese show route plasticity and moult site fidelity transferable to Snow Geese. Proposed network: 200-tag stratified sample across MCP & Western Arctic Pop.

### 5.3 Harvest & Household-Level Surveys
Example: Makkovik 1980–81 (85 kg capita⁻¹ yr⁻¹). Modern tablets + ODK forms reduce recall bias. Data feed to FNS composite.

### 5.4 Integrated Data Platforms
Key requirement: *Arctic Goose Hub*—cloud repository linking UAV orthomosaics, satellite layers, telemetry, harvest and socio-economic tables. APIs supply dashboards for co-management boards.

## 6. Management Toolbox

### 6.1 Harvest-Centric Measures
1. **Spring Conservation Orders (US, 1999)**—liberalised regs, e-calls, unplugged shotguns; raised harvest by ~300 k but still <population growth.  
2. **Community Quotas**—Inuvialuit 1987–90 removed 10 400 birds yr⁻¹; integration into Flyway Councils recommended again.  
3. **Redistribution Networks**—James Bay Cree program reached 76 % households → socio-nutritional co-benefits.

*Design principle*: tie quota to FNS needs (e.g., 30 lb goose/person yr as baseline) and ecological targets (50 % reduction in shrub-to-barren conversion rate in 10 yr).

### 6.2 Colony-Level Actions
• **Egg/chick harvest**—supported by Inuit in Arviat/Coral Harbour; lower adult female re-nest probability.  
• **Egg oiling/addling**—~96 % efficacy but labour intensive.  
• **Mechanical disturbance**—ATV or drone fly-overs create >30 % nest desertion if <10 d post-laying.

### 6.3 Predation & Trophic Re-balancing
Speculative but plausible: artificial fox dens, attractant subsidies to boost fox presence; caution: could elevate predation on other ground-nesters.

### 6.4 Agricultural Push–Pull (Winter Grounds)
Contrarian idea: pay farmers to *not* flood rice fields in late winter or to time plough-down pre-arrival. Pilot “Agro-Offset” credit (~US$5 acre⁻¹) funded by carbon-market revenues earmarked for Arctic remediation.

### 6.5 Market & Policy Instruments
• **Certified Wild Arctic Goose Meat**—value-added processing for southern markets, generating revenue for Indigenous harvesters.  
• **Carbon credits for peat preservation**—monetise avoided CO₂ emissions from vegetation recovery.

## 7. Comparative Evaluation of Monitoring + Management Options

| Option | Ecological Impact (10) | FNS Impact (10) | Cost | Social Acceptability | Data Needs |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------------|------|---------------------|-------------|
| UAV + Landsat monitoring | 7 | 2 | $$ | High | Mod |
| Telemetry | 6 | 1 | $$$ | High | High |
| Community harvest quotas + redistribution | 8 | 9 | $ | Very High | Low |
| Egg harvest/oiling | 6 | 4 | $$ | Medium | Low |
| Predator support | 4? | 2 | $ | Medium-Low | High |
| Winter agro-offset | 5 | 0 | $$ | Medium | High |

Aggregate: **community-led harvest plus tech-enabled monitoring offers the highest joint ecological-FNS return per dollar**.

## 8. Integrated Socio-Ecological Modelling Framework
Use a coupled **Population Matrix Model** (age-structured, harvest & density dependence) with **System Dynamics FNS module**. State variables:
* Goose Nᵃ (age classes)  
* Vegetation state fraction (G, S, B)  
* Per-capita traditional food lbs  
* FNS composite score

Decision levers: harvest rate h, egg harvest e, predator density p, agro-offset a.  Objective: maximise FNS subject to vegetation state ≥50 % graminoid by 2040.

## 9. Implementation Roadmap (2025–2040)
Year 0–2: Governance & Baseline  
• Ratify Arctic Goose Hub data-sharing MOUs.  
• Tag 200 geese; launch UAV baseline at 10 colonies.  
• Adopt FNS composite across Nunavut & Inuvialuit.  

Year 3–7: Action Pilots  
• Community quota + redistribution in 5 hubs (e.g., Arviat, Tuktoyaktuk).  
• Egg harvest trials at Karrak Lake (target 20 000 eggs).  
• Winter agro-offset pilot with Louisiana rice growers.

Year 8–15: Scaling & Adaptive Feedback  
• Expand monitoring to entire flyway; integrate SAR biomass index.  
• Adjust quotas annually via Bayesian forecasting.  

Year 16+: Consolidation  
• Evaluate vegetation recovery (goal: ≥30 % graminoid regain).  
• Institutionalise carbon-credit funding into Inuit Impact & Benefit Agreements.

## 10. Knowledge Gaps, Emerging Tech & Contrarian Ideas
1. **Graminoid seed augmentation** post-colony disturbance—low-cost drones for aerial seeding.  
2. **CRISPR-based fertility control**—speculative, high ethical barrier.  
3. **Large-scale avian predator rewilding** (e.g., white-tailed eagles).  
4. **eDNA in meltwater** to cheaply index goose use intensity.  
5. **Blockchain harvest certification** for southern gourmet markets.

## 11. Conclusions
Snow goose hyper-abundance is a coupled socio-ecological challenge; liberal hunting alone is insufficient, but when fused with Indigenous-led community quotas, advanced monitoring, and policy innovation the dual objectives of ecosystem recovery and Arctic food security are achievable within 15–20 years. The key is continuous, co-designed adaptive management anchored by a shared FNS-population dashboard.
