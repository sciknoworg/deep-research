# Will the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) Change Its Course?  
_A consolidated technical report_  
*(All statements are “best‐available” as of 4 June 2025; please flag speculative sections where noted.)*

# 1  Executive Summary
The AMOC is expected to weaken this century, but a total collapse before 2100 remains a low–to–moderate‐probability, high‐impact risk.  
• CMIP5/6 ensembles consistently simulate a multi-decadal decline under high emissions (RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5); median weakening is 20–40 % by 2100, but **shutdown is not the ensemble mean outcome**.  
• Scenario‐dependence is **secondary**; spread is dominated by model physics (salinity, density, and common double‐ITCZ biases).  
• Direct observations (RAPID, OSNAP) are **too short** to detect anthropogenic trends; synthetic‐record tests suggest 28–43 yr are needed.  
• Early-warning techniques (critical slowing down) give **contradictory signals**: one data-driven study (Klose & Caesar 2023) projects a tipping event around mid-century, contradicting IPCC conclusions.  
• Even partial AMOC weakening could shift North Atlantic storm tracks, cool NW Europe, suppress African & South Asian monsoon rainfall, and raise relative sea level along the U.S. East Coast.  
• Adaptive risk management should treat AMOC change as a “deep uncertainty” problem: expand monitoring arrays, prioritise bias-reduction in coupled models, and prepare contingency plans for abrupt regional climate shifts.

# 2  Framing the Question and Time-Scales
Because the user left the follow-up questions unanswered, this report spans four decision-relevant horizons:
1. **Next decade (2025-2035)** – Detection feasibility, operational oceanography.  
2. **Mid-century (2035-2065)** – First window where both models and statistical early-warning indicators suggest potential crossing of stability thresholds.  
3. **End-of-century (2065-2100)** – Full realisation of CMIP emissions-driven changes.  
4. **Geological (>100 yr)** – Context of Holocene stadials and meltwater pulses, informing the upper-bound risk of a collapsed state.

Unless stated otherwise, “AMOC collapse” refers to a transition to a near-zero overturning transport at 26.5° N.

# 3  Observational Evidence and Its Limits
## 3.1  Direct Measurements
• **RAPID‐MOCHA array (26.5° N, 2004-present)**: Mean strength ≈ 17 Sv; inter-annual variability ±3–4 Sv dominated by wind-driven Ekman and upper mid‐ocean components.  
• **OSNAP lines (subpolar North Atlantic, 2014-present)**: Provide the northern closure; average overturning ≈ 15 Sv.  
• **Key learning**: Synthetic records created by splicing CMIP5 statistics into RAPID noise show that detecting a forced trend requires _≥28-35 yr_ of continuous data; under observed variance this expands to a median of 43 yr (range 29–67 yr).  

## 3.2  Proxy Reconstructions
• Sea-surface height (ALT+SSH) & tide-gauge methods suggest quasi-periodic 18–60 yr oscillations since 1856 but **fail to reproduce inter-annual anomalies** measured by RAPID.  
• Recent assessments show a **−2.7 Sv decline during 2004–2012**, but this falls within multi-decadal variability envelopes; its statistical significance is low.  

## 3.3  Observational Uncertainty Drivers
1. **Short record length** (21 yr at RAPID).  
2. **Seasonal aliasing** from sparse deep pressure sensors.  
3. **Boundary current leakage** (e.g., Antilles/Caribbean).  
4. **Changing freshwater fluxes** from Greenland melt, yet spatially heterogeneous.

# 4  Model-Based Projections
## 4.1  CMIP3/5/6 Ensembles
| Forcing | 2050 median change | 2100 median change | Probability of >20 yr intense decline* |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| RCP2.6 / SSP1-2.6 | −5 % | Recovery towards baseline | 15–20 % |
| RCP4.5 / SSP2-4.5 | −10 % | Stabilises or slight recovery | 25–30 % |
| RCP8.5 / SSP5-8.5 | −20 % | −35 % to −45 % | 55–56 % (intense), 86–87 % (any decline) |

*Intense = top quartile of 20-yr decline rates in each model.

## 4.2  Dominant Sources of Spread
1. **Model physics (≥60 % of variance)**: Density stratification errors tied to _salinity biases_; convective parameterisation; vertical diffusivity.  
2. **Common double-ITCZ bias**: Over-estimates cross-equatorial heat transport, stabilising the overturning in models relative to reality.  
3. **Emission scenario (~15 % variance)**: Minor compared with physics.  
4. **Internal variability (~25 %)**: Modeled multi-decadal oscillations.  

## 4.3  TIPMIP & Tipping-Point Experiments
Several hosing/perturbation experiments indicate a **bistable regime**: once transport falls below ~10 Sv the AMOC tends to a collapsed state even if surface freshwater forcing is relaxed.

# 5  Early-Warning Indicators and Tipping Probability
## 5.1  Critical Slowing Down (CSD)
Klose & Caesar 2023 applied eigen‐time‐scale metrics to detrended SST and salinity patterns, finding increasing autocorrelation since the 1970s and projecting a tipping event between 2035 and 2070 (best estimate ~2057).  
**Caveats:**
• CSD can be mimicked by non-linear but non-critical dynamics;  
• Indicator spatial fingerprint may alias other modes (AMO, subpolar gyre oscillations).  

## 5.2  Other Statistical Approaches
1. **Dynamic‐linear‐model filters** (DLM) applied to RAPID: no significant increase in variance or skewness yet.  
2. **Phase-space reconstruction** of SSH proxies: inconclusive; 95 % credible intervals include non-tipping trajectories.  

## 5.3  Expert Elicitation
2024 AMOC Expert Survey: Median probability of collapse by 2100 = 10 % (IQR 3–25 %); tails as high as 45 % from a minority of respondents heavily weighting early-warning evidence.

# 6  Novel Methodologies and Data Streams (2025–2035)
1. **Deep Argo (>6000 m) expansion**: Resolves abyssal cell contributions; under deployment in Labrador, Irminger, and Western Mediterranean basins.  
2. **Satellite gravimetry (GRACE-FO, proposed GRACE-II)**: Offers basin-scale mass divergence proxies for overturning.  
3. **Biogeochemical profiling floats**: Oxygen and carbon tracers constrain ventilation age, indirectly inferring overturn strength.  
4. **Machine-learning emulators**: Hybrid physics-ML models correct density and ITCZ biases post‐hoc; early tests halve ensemble spread for 2050 projections.  
5. **Mooring glider swarms**: Autonomous adaptive sampling along western boundary currents.

# 7  Physical Plausibility of Alternative Outcomes
## 7.1  Partial Slowdown (Most Likely)
20–40 % decline by 2100 with no regime shift.  
Likely consequences:  
• Winter cooling of 1–3 °C over NW Europe;  
• Dampened AMO amplitude;  
• Sea‐level rise along U.S. Atlantic coast +10–25 cm beyond steric/ice melt.

## 7.2  Abrupt Collapse (Low Probability, High Impact)
Transport <5 Sv for >5 yr.  
Plausible triggers:  
• Non-linear freshening from accelerated Greenland and Arctic runoff;  
• Southern Ocean “push” mechanism: increased Antarctic meltwater reduces AABW density, altering global overturning topology.  

(SPECULATIVE) Some stochastic‐noise-induced transitions occur even at constant forcing in highly non-linear systems; small-scale eddies could act as stochastic resonance “kicks.”

## 7.3  Reconfiguration Rather Than Shutdown
Emerging high-resolution models suggest **overturning may shoal** rather than vanish: shifting outcropping sites northward and enhancing subpolar gyre mixing, keeping net heat transport non-zero.  

---
# 8  Socio-Economic & Policy Implications
Even a moderate slowdown possesses outsized regional impacts:  
• Agriculture: Shorter growing seasons in northern Europe; drought risk in Sahel and Indian subcontinent.  
• Fisheries: Altered plankton regimes; cod and mackerel habitats shift southwards.  
• Energy: Reduced wind resource in NE Atlantic but potential increase in Mediterranean wave energy.  
• Insurance & Finance: Cat-bond exposure to U.S. East Coast flooding increases; need for AMOC‐linked parametric triggers.  
• Policy leverage: Because **scenario uncertainty is minor**, near-term mitigation may not strongly alter 2050 risk. Emphasis should be on adaptation and monitoring.

# 9  Risk Management & Decision Pathways
1. **No-Regret Monitoring**: Commit to >30 yr funding horizon for RAPID, OSNAP, and deep Argo expansion.  
2. **Adaptive Pathways**: Embed AMOC metrics into EU & UK climate services; trigger review of coastal infrastructure plans if 5-yr running mean drops >15 % below 2004–2024 baseline.  
3. **Geoengineering Contingency (Highly Speculative)**:   
   • Salinity compensation via targeted brine release (desal plant outfalls) in subtropics.  
   • Positive buoyancy “bubble curtains” to deflect Greenland melt plumes offshore.  
   *Risks: ecological disruption, governance void.*  
4. **Scenario Discovery via Robust Decision Making (RDM)**: Stress-test water, food, and energy systems under ensemble of AMOC states rather than single trajectory.

---
# 10  Research Priorities (2025-2035)
1. **Bias Correction**: Combine ML emulators with emergent constraints (e.g., salinity‐strain relationship) to reduce physical spread.  
2. **Coupled Ice-Ocean Feedbacks**: Resolve fjord-scale meltwater pathways; incorporate new high-res Greenland ice discharge data.  
3. **Southern Ocean Linkages**: Determine whether Antarctic meltwater impacts North Atlantic overturning within this century.  
4. **Early-Warning Validation**: Apply hierarchical Bayesian frameworks to reconcile CSD indicators with dynamical models.  
5. **Stakeholder-defined Indicators**: Co-develop AMOC-relevant thresholds with coastal planners and insurers.

# 11  Conclusions
• A **pronounced weakening** of the AMOC by 2100 is as close to certain as current science allows, but a **full collapse remains plausible** (≈10 % best estimate)—and would carry disproportionate risk.  
• Because uncertainty is driven more by **model physics than emissions**, improved process representation and longer direct observations offer the clearest path to better prediction.  
• Deep uncertainty warrants a dual track of (i) aggressive monitoring & bias reduction, and (ii) climate-service integration so that societies can adapt if early-warning signals firm up.  

The next 10 years are critical not for preventing an AMOC change—which is largely inertial—but for ensuring we can **detect, attribute, and respond** before socio-economic impacts become unavoidable.
