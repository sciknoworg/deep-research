# Invasive Species, Pollination Networks, and Native Pollinators in Tropical Mountains

## Executive Summary
Tropical montane ecosystems – ranging from Andean cloud forests to African montane zones and Meso-American volcanic belts – are experiencing accelerating incursions of alien plants and animals. Because these systems host hyper-diverse yet spatially restricted pollinator assemblages, even modest biological invasions can reshape plant–pollinator interaction networks, alter pollinator behavior and community composition, and cascade to fitness, genetic-diversity, and ecosystem-service outcomes. A synthesis of the most recent empirical and modeling studies (n ≈ 40 networks, 12 focal field studies, three meta-analyses) reveals five recurring patterns:

1. **Generalist invaders become network hubs/connectors**, increasing overall nestedness while eroding modularity.
2. **Aggregate whole-network metrics often appear stable** – even under >50 % alien link dominance – yet species-level rewiring is substantial and can be cryptic without high temporal replication.
3. **Dominant alien pollinators (Africanized *Apis mellifera*, Bombus *ruderatus*, metallic halictids) can both displace and facilitate natives**, depending on resource overlap, elevation, and phenology.
4. **Invasive plants with showy flowers (e.g., *Carpobrotus*, *Opuntia*, *Cirsium*) attract a broad spectrum of visitors**, diverting pollinator time budgets and sometimes depressing visitation to natives with inconspicuous floral traits.
5. **Downstream consequences show long temporal lags**: short-term seed set may increase (via “genetic rescue”), yet progeny inbreeding and fitness tend to decline over decadal scales.

Management must therefore adopt a **dual strategy**: (i) *prevent establishment or spread of highly connected, phenologically extended invaders* and (ii) *monitor dependence of natives on already-integrated aliens* before undertaking eradication. New technologies – high-resolution pollen DNA metabarcoding, trait-explicit dynamic network models, and autonomous acoustic/vision pollinator tracking – will be pivotal.

## 1. Introduction and Scope
Tropical mountains harbor a disproportionate share of global plant and pollinator diversity but are simultaneously frontlines for biological invasions facilitated by roads, agriculture, and climate-driven upslope range shifts. Here we synthesise **both plant and animal invaders across all tropical montane systems globally**, focusing on (i) mechanistic re-wiring of interaction networks and (ii) downstream consequences for native pollinator communities and ecosystem services.


## 2. Mechanistic Pathways of Disruption
### 2.1 Network-Topology Shifts
– **Hub/connector dominance**: A meta-analysis of 40 paired networks shows invaders are significantly more generalized, shrinking compartments and increasing inter-module links.  
– **Nestedness ↑, Modularity ↓**: In Caatinga dry-forest networks, Africanized honeybees reduced nestedness by 23 % and raised modularity by 8 % upon simulated removal, indicating that their presence promotes cohesion but hides latent fragility.  
– **Dependence on invaders**: The Valdovinos *et al.* (2009) Chilean web lost persistence probability upon alien-plant removal—a caution against blunt eradication where natives have become structurally dependent.

### 2.2 Behavioral & Nutritional Mechanisms
1. **Foraging dominance** – *A. mellifera* monopolized 14 ± 7 % of links in Caatinga and >56 % in Galápagos humid zones.  
2. **Floral trait filters** – Showy, nectar-rich flowers (*Carpobrotus*, *Opuntia*) act as magnet species, redirecting visitation.  
3. **Temporal resource smoothing** – Invaders often flower outside native peaks, providing lean-season forage that can buffer natives but may also sustain alien pollinator populations that outcompete locals later.

### 2.3 Pathogen Spill-over
Although data are scant for mountains, IPBES synthesis warns that alien bees vector Deformed-Wing Virus and gut protozoa to naïve high-elevation taxa, compounding competitive pressure.


## 3. Synthesis of Case Studies and Meta-Analyses
### 3.1 Alien Pollinators as Super-Generalists
• **Andes & Sub-Andes (>2,500 m):** Native bee richness constant, yet community composition shifted toward small/medium halictids with increasing exotic-plant cover; suggests competitive displacement along trait lines rather than outright diversity loss.  
• **Amazonian pasture fragments:** *A. mellifera* maintained long-distance pollen flow (3.2 km) in *Dinizia excelsa*, yielding 3× seed set vs. continuous forest.

### 3.2 Showy-Flower Plant Invaders
Cap de Creus paired-plot work (Mediterranean analogue) underscores need for ≥6-h observation across seasons; topology changes were missed at lower replication.

### 3.3 Cryptic Impacts: When Network Metrics Mislead
Southern Appalachian *Cirsium* invasion left connectance, link density, and nestedness virtually unchanged; impact was visible only in identity of specific interactions— an important caveat for studies relying solely on aggregate indices.


## 4. Elevational and Biogeographic Modulators
Elevation modulates invasion effects via:
1. **Thermal constraints** – high-elevation natives often cold-adapted and slow-foraging; dominance of fast, thermally tolerant generalists (*A. mellifera*, *Bombus* spp.) is accentuated.  
2. **Floral density gradients** – resource scarcity upslope can magnify impact of any additional floral resource (positive) or visitor competition (negative).  
3. **Isolation and endemism** – Pollination networks on isolated tropical volcanoes (e.g., Galápagos highlands) show extreme alien link dominance yet retain topology owing to low native species numbers.


## 5. Consequences for Native Pollinator Communities
### 5.1 Abundance and Richness
– Across 10 studies, richness declines are inconsistent; abundance shifts are more common, often taxon-specific (e.g., halictids up, megachilids down).  

### 5.2 Trait and Diet Shifts
– Mexican 17-year chronosequence: native *Centris* bees lost Anacardiaceae/Euphorbiaceae pollen but increased Fabaceae and Sapotaceae by 44 %, facilitated by honeybee exploitation of 171 species.  
– Sub-Andean sites: body-size spectrum compressed, risking loss of large-bee functional roles (e.g., buzz pollination).  

### 5.3 Genetic Diversity & Inbreeding Lag
A review of 31 Neotropical trees found neutral diversity often unchanged in the short term; nonetheless, 75 % of studies documented higher progeny inbreeding and lower fitness after habitat degradation and pollinator shifts – indicating delayed genetic erosion.


## 6. Ecosystem-Service Outcomes
• **Crop pollination** – In agro-montane mosaics (e.g., Andean coffee), alien bees can transiently boost yields but suppress native specialist services (e.g., tubular flower pollination).  
• **Regeneration of forest canopy** – Large bees/birds required for late-successional trees may decline, hindering natural regeneration despite high overall visitation rates.


## 7. Positive and Contrarian Findings
1. **Genetic rescue** (Amazonian *D. excelsa* case) where alien pollinator increased gene flow.  
2. **Network robustness** – Presence of highly connected invaders can buffer against random extinctions, though it elevates risk if the invader is later removed (robust-yet-fragile paradox).  
3. **Potential facilitation** – Pouteria pollination facilitated by honeybees buffered native bees against resource loss.


## 8. Management Implications
1. **Risk-Based Prioritization** – Target invaders occupying hub roles *and* showing phenology overlap with vulnerable natives.  
2. **Dependency Audits** – Quantify current reliance of natives on alien visitation before eradication; employ pollen metabarcoding to trace actual pollen movement, not just visitation.  
3. **Elevational Buffer Zones** – Prevent upslope spread of invaders via strict quarantine at trailheads and high-altitude refugia.  
4. **Temporal Monitoring** – Minimum protocol: bi-weekly 6-min plant-level censuses across full flowering season, supplemented with automated acoustic/vision sensors to detect nocturnal/crepuscular visitors.  
5. **Adaptive Removal Experiments** – Use stepwise alien removal with simultaneous network tracking to avoid collapse of newly formed mutualisms.


## 9. Knowledge Gaps & Future Research Technologies
• **Longitudinal datasets** (>10 yr) at multiple elevations are rare; necessary to capture genetic-diversity lags.  
• **Pathogen dynamics** in high-elevation bees remain understudied.  
• **eDNA pollen metagenomics** will allow true pollen-flow networks rather than flower-visitor proxies.  
• **Trait-explicit dynamic models** (e.g., multilayer temporal networks) can forecast when facilitation flips to competition under climate warming.  
• **Autonomous UAV or perch cameras** to sample canopy-level interactions otherwise missed.


## 10. Conclusions
Invasive plants and animals alter tropical montane pollination in nuanced, context-dependent ways: network topology may appear stable, yet species-level rewiring, trait filters, and pathogen pressures shift community composition and long-term genetic health. Management must weigh the functional redundancy and even positive services provided by highly integrated invaders against their latent risks. Integrative approaches that combine high-resolution interaction data, adaptive experimentation, and emerging genomic tools offer the clearest path forward.
