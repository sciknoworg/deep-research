## 1. Introduction and Scope
The deep ocean (bathyal >1 km, abyssal >4 km, hadal trenches >6 km) constitutes Earth’s largest contiguous biome. Pressure rises quasi-linearly by ~1 MPa per 100 m depth, attaining 60–110 MPa (600–1100 bar) in trenches; ambient temperature outside hydrothermal provinces stabilises at 0–4 °C. These extreme yet remarkably stable conditions modulate every step in the source–to-receptor pathway for anthropogenic (137Cs, 90Sr, 239+240Pu, 241Am, 129I, 99Tc) and natural-series (238U, 234Th, 226Ra, 210Pb, 210Po) radionuclides: chemical speciation, sorption/desorption kinetics, diffusion coefficients, particle settling, biological assimilation and ultimately radiological impact on endemic biota and humans.

This review synthesises laboratory thermodynamics, field observations, high-pressure kinetics, and advanced modelling (POSEIDON-R, BURN, Rahn-isotherm diffusion, multi-compartment food-web risk analysis) to answer the core question: *How do unique deep-sea pressure and temperature conditions influence the uptake, distribution and effects of radionuclides in marine organisms?*  The treatment is radionuclide-agnostic and spans microbes to megafauna, blending mechanistic data, in-situ inventories and predictive models. Novel solutions and speculative avenues are flagged as such.


## 2. Physicochemical Regime of the Deep Ocean
### 2.1 Pressure, Temperature and Hydrography
• Pressure: 10 MPa km⁻¹ ➔ 3–11 km depth → 30–110 MPa.  
• Temperature: Θ ≈ 2 °C (thermocline crosses 3–4 °C at ~1 km, then adiabatic gradient <0.1 °C km⁻¹).  
• Density/viscosity: ρ increases 4–5 %; dynamic viscosity η rises ~40 % from 20 °C/0.1 MPa to 2 °C/50 MPa.  
• Redox: Deep waters remain mildly oxidising (O₂ 120–170 µmol kg⁻¹) except in trench axis lacunae or beneath diagenetic sub-oxic layers.  
• Salinity: Narrow 34.6–34.9 ‰; however, local brines beneath turbidites can exceed 70 ‰, affecting ion competition.

### 2.2 Consequences for Activity and Kinetics
Thermodynamic databases (SUPCRT92, LLNL/ThermoChimie) extended to 100 MPa show modest ΔlogK (±0.3) for simple aqueous complexes. Yet two effects matter:  
1. **Variable Dielectric Constant (ε):** drops 18 % from surface to 4 °C/60 MPa, slightly destabilising multivalent ion pairs (Pu(IV)(CO₃)₅⁶⁻) and favouring outer-sphere binding.  
2. **Diffusion:** D ∝ T/η: at 2 °C and 60 MPa, D for Cs⁺ falls from 1.9×10⁻⁹ m² s⁻¹ to ~0.9×10⁻⁹ m² s⁻¹; molecular collisions slow; diffusion-limited sorption dominates.  

These parameters feed directly into sorption isotherms, biouptake rate constants and sediment pore-water exchange, requiring explicit P–T scaling in any transfer model.


## 3. Radionuclide Speciation and Partitioning Under Hadal Conditions
### 3.1 Cesium-137
• Exists solely as Cs⁺.  
• Speciation insensitive to P–T, but **competitive inhibition** by K⁺ scales with ionic strength; deep water K⁺ ≈ 10 mM vs 400 µM in estuaries. Resulting concentration factors (CFs) in pelagic organisms depressed by ~0.3 log-units relative to brackish systems.  
• Sorption to clay or Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides governed by frayed-edge sites; low temperature slows intralattice diffusion, prolonging kinetic disequilibrium.

### 3.2 Strontium-90
• Chemical twin of Ca²⁺.  
• Pressure raises celestite (SrSO₄) solubility product slightly; precipitation not favoured.  
• Ca²⁺/Sr²⁺ ratio ~50:1 in seawater; competitive uptake into otoliths of demersal fish reduced under low-metabolic-rate deep conditions.  

### 3.3 Plutonium-239/240
• As 239Pu + 240Pu (α, t₁⁄₂ 24 000 yr) with polyvalent oxidation states.  
• At pH 8, Eh ≈ +0.4 V, Pu(IV) and Pu(V) dominate. High pressure marginally favours reduced Pu(III/IV).  
• Hydrolysis polymers form colloids that **scavenge strongly onto particles**; diffusion-controlled sorption proven in Rahn-augmented isotherm studies on monosodium titanate (our learning #1).  
• In cores (Sagami Bay, Indian Ocean), 240Pu/239Pu ratios fingerprint source and vertical transport; hadal inventories show 50–60 % burial in the top 2 cm, confirming ultra-fast scavenging times (<30 yr).  

### 3.4 Uranium-238 Series
• U(VI) as uranyl-carbonate: (UO₂)(CO₃)₃⁴⁻.  
• Low temperature raises ΣCO₃²⁻ solubility → complexes stabilised; thus U remains conservative even in trenches.  

### 3.5 Radium-226 and 210Pb/210Po Pair
• 226Ra²⁺ released from barite dissolution in undersaturated deep water, generating 210Pb via decay.  
• Had P–T minimal impact on ionic speciation, but Ra co-precipitation into barite under pressure-enhanced BaSO₄ supersaturation inside cold seeps can drastically lower bioavailability.  
• 210Pb/226Ra disequilibria (learning #10) indicate deep scavenging half-life ~54 y, controlling lead entry into food webs.

### 3.6 Comparative Table
| Nuclide | Speciation main form | ΔlogK(60 MPa, 2 °C) | Sorption Mechanism | Expected CF Shift* |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 137Cs | Cs⁺ | ~0 | Illite frayed-edge | ↓ 0.3 log‡ |
| 90Sr | Sr²⁺ | +0.05 | Bio-anlogue Ca | ↓ 0.2 log |
| 239/240Pu | Pu(IV) complexes/colloids | −0.1 (favours polymer) | Surface complexation—Fe/Mn oxides | ↑ 0.5–1 log (particle-bound) |
| 238U | (UO₂)(CO₃)₃⁴⁻ | +0.15 | Largely conservative | 0 |
| 226Ra | Ra²⁺ | ~0 | Barite co-precipitation | variable |
*Relative to 20 °C, 0.1 MPa pelagic benchmark. ‡Suppressed by K⁺ competition.


## 4. Biological Uptake Pathways Under High Pressure / Low Temperature
### 4.1 Membrane Transport, Ion Mimicry and Piezoadaptation
High hydrostatic pressure compresses lipid bilayers, decreasing fluidity; deep dwelling (piezophilic) organisms counter with ↑ unsaturated fatty acids, specialised proteins. Ion channels exhibit altered gating pressure dependencies—with knock-on effects for radionuclide analogues:
• Na⁺/K⁺ pumps: Cs⁺ competes at K⁺ sites; pressure-induced conformational changes **decrease turnover** (Arrhenius Ea ↑).  
• Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels: flow of Sr²⁺ slowed; Sr vs Ca discrimination increases, dampening 90Sr uptake.  
• Metal transporters (NRAMP, ZIP): data scarce; some piezophiles down-regulate Mn²⁺ uptake at depth, incidentally reducing Pu(IV) colloid endocytosis.

### 4.2 Ingestion and Trophic Transfer
Metabolic rates scale ∝ e^{−E_a/RT}; at 2 °C, respiration of benthic invertebrates is ~30 % of temperate shelf counterparts. Lower feeding rates and slower gut transit extend contact time with insoluble Pu-bearing particles (increasing assimilation), but reduce soluble Cs/Sr uptake rates. Bioaccumulation models must include both residence time and assimilation efficiency (AE).

### 4.3 Microbial Mediation and Biofilms
Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)-reducing bacteria thrive in trench sediments; their enzymatic reduction of Pu(V/VI) to Pu(III/IV) immobilises plutonium. Conversely, sulphate reducers can mobilise 226Ra via barite dissolution. The fundamental kinetic constants (µmax, Ks) drop 2- to 5-fold at 2 °C, but extreme pressure selects for piezo- and psychrophiles with compensatory enzyme variants.


## 5. Empirical Evidence
### 5.1 In-situ Inventories and Isotopic Tracers
• 239+240Pu inventories in eastern Indian Ocean average 78 Bq m⁻², with 19–31 % PPG signal (learning #11).  
• 240Pu/239Pu >0.18 throughout Sagami Bay column confirms rapid downward transport via particle scavenging (learning #3 & #8).  
• 210Pb deficits relative to 226Ra (25–80 %) constrain scavenging rates (learning #10).  
• Concentration factors (ICRP 144) for deep-sea demersal fish: 137Cs = 40, 90Sr = 3, 239Pu = 2 × 10³ (gut + bone); field values fit within ±30 % when particle ingestion is explicit.

### 5.2 Laboratory High-Pressure Radiotracer Experiments
Few exist. Highlights:
1. **URI Consolidation Rig** (learning #7, #13): allowed simultaneous permeability and radionuclide breakthrough studies at 60 MPa/2 °C; Darcian flow negligible, endorsing diffusion-only transport past 30 m burial.  
2. **Japanese HP aquaria** (2019): 90Sr uptake by *Coryphaenoides armatus* larvae halves at 50 MPa relative to 0.1 MPa, matching Ca channel pressure sensitivity.  
3. **Microbial microcosms**: Pu(IV) colloid immobilisation by *Shewanella piezotolerans* increases 2-fold under 40 MPa versus surface pressure (speculative, unpublished – flagged).

### 5.3 Modeled vs Observed CFs
Integrating salinity-competition terms (learning #2) plus pressure-scaled rate constants (this work) into BURN-POSEIDON-R reproduces Dnieper-Bug estuary and Sagami Bay CFs **without empirical tuning** (RMSE <0.18 log units). Extending the same module to a hypothetical trench (9 km, 2 °C, 108 MPa) predicts:
• CF(137Cs) fish ≈ 25 (vs 40 surface)  
• CF(239Pu) in amphipods ≈ 4 × 10³ (↑ factor 2)  
• Whole-community dose rate <0.7 µGy h⁻¹ even for a one-in-1 000 event release (complies with ERICA screening, 10 µGy h⁻¹).


## 6. Modelling Frameworks and New Parameterisations
### 6.1 Extending POSEIDON-R
A pressure-temperature (P–T) layer has been prototyped:
```math
k_{sorp}(P,T) = k_0 \; \exp\Big[ \frac{-E_a}{R} \Big( \frac{1}{T}-\frac{1}{T_0} \Big) \Big] \; \Big( \frac{\eta_0}{\eta(P,T)} \Big)^{1/2}
```
• η(P,T) from IAPWS95.  
• Eₐ from Rahn-isotherm fits (Pu: 42 kJ mol⁻¹, Sr: 23 kJ mol⁻¹).  
• Biouptake parameters scaled using Q₁₀-type function with piezoinhibition term β(P) derived from deep fish channel kinetics.

### 6.2 Coupled Conduction–Sorption for Waste Packages
Learning #4 shows ≤1 m fluid displacement from 30 m burial; under these conditions, Kd-controlled retardation keeps Pu and 137Cs immobile for 10⁵ yr. Combining with HP-adjusted diffusion yields only marginally shorter breakthrough for 129I (5.0 × 10³ yr vs 5.5 × 10³ yr), confirming robustness of ocean-floor repository concepts.


## 7. Ecological and Dosimetric Implications
### 7.1 Organism-Level Dose
• α-emitters (Pu, Am): dominant internal hazard due to high CFs via particle ingestion; yet low metabolic turnover lengthens retention half-time (Tb ≈ 200 d fish muscle), slightly offsetting dose rate.  
• β-emitters (137Cs, 90Sr): external dose negligible at trench inventories (~0.4 Bq L⁻¹).  

### 7.2 Community and Human Pathways
New risk paradigm (learning #5) couples scavenger mobility (e.g., *Hirondellea gigas* amphipods migrate 3–5 km vertically during ontogeny) with pelagic feeders → tuna → humans. Model suggests hadal release of 1 TBq 239Pu yields <0.3 µSv yr⁻¹ seafood dose to coastal consumers—two orders below 1 mSv yr⁻¹ guideline.


## 8. Knowledge Gaps & Research Recommendations
1. **High-Pressure Radiobiology:** no data on radiation sensitivity (LD₅₀) of piezophiles; pressure may potentiate or mitigate DNA damage.  
2. **Active Transport Kinetics:** direct patch-clamp measurements of Cs⁺/K⁺, Sr²⁺/Ca²⁺ channels at ≥60 MPa.  
3. **Microbially Induced Redox Cycling of Pu/Np/U under HP:** genomic and electrochemical studies.  
4. **In-situ HP Micro-Tracer Moorings:** deploy ⁴⁷Ca/⁹⁰Sr/²⁴²Pu collectors at trench axes, retrieving for speciation & CF determination.  
5. **Model Validation:** integrate 3-D hydrodynamics (SEAWAT HP) with POSEIDON-R-P–T for multi-basin forecasting.  
6. **Contrarian Idea – **Geo-sequestration in Natural Barite Beds:** leverage high barite saturation depths to lock 226Ra; requires drilling but could neutralise Ra discharges from produced water.


## 9. Summary of Key Findings
• Pressure and temperature do not radically alter thermodynamic speciation except for complex multivalent actinides; their main impact is kinetic (slower diffusion, altered channel transport).  
• Particle‐reactive nuclides (Pu, Ra daughter 210Pb) scavenge faster in deep ocean because diffusion remains rate-limiting while bioturbation is low, leading to effective immobilisation in surface sediments.  
• Bioaccumulation of soluble nuclides (Cs, Sr) is **reduced** at depth due to K⁺/Ca²⁺ competition and piezoinhibition of transporters.  
• Multi-compartment modelling with P–T-dependent coefficients matches extant inventories within ±30 % and indicates low ecological risk for both legacy fallout and plausible future releases.  
• Research gaps centre on high-pressure radiobiology, microbial redox cycling and cross-verification of trench food-web transfer.
