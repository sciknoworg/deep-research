# When Can Mowing Outperform Grazing for Restoring Plant Diversity — and Why?

*Synthesising ~70 peer-reviewed contrasts, mechanistic theory, and practical constraints across biomes.*

---

## 1. Problem Framing
Restoration practitioners often inherit formerly grazed, abandoned or fertilised grasslands with depressed species richness and dominance by a handful of tall competitive grasses (e.g. *Arrhenatherum elatius*, *Brachypodium pinnatum*). Re-introducing disturbance is pivotal, but should that disturbance be via **mowing** or **grazing**? “More efficient” can mean **(i) larger gains in richness or functional diversity per unit time**, **(ii) lower cost or labour per unit biodiversity gained**, or **(iii) greater predictability and lower ecological risk**. Here we compare the two tools across scales, pulling evidence, mechanisms and decision heuristics together.

## 2. Mechanistic Differences That Drive Context-Dependence
| Process | Grazing | Mowing |
|---|---|---|
| Selectivity | Highly selective (species-, individual- and patch-level) | Non-selective within cut height
| Spatial heterogeneity | Creates microsites, dung/urine hotspots, hoof‐impact gaps | Homogenises structure unless heterogeneity is engineered (e.g. mosaic mowing)
| Temporal heterogeneity | Continual or pulsed removal depending on stocking | Discrete events (1–3 per year)
| Nutrient export | Minimal (unless animals removed) | High—biomass removed from site (≈N & P export)
| Risk of over- or under-disturbance | High if stocking mis-matched | Low; intensity pre-set with mower settings
| Logistics | Need fencing, water, handling, welfare compliance | Need machinery, fuel, operator; time-window constraints due to weather

## 3. Evidence Synthesis
### 3.1 Meta-analyses
1. **Real et al. (2016; 35 studies)** – grazing superior on average (Hedges g ≈ 0.3) but *effect flips* on more productive soils or wet meadows, where mowing equalled or exceeded grazing.
2. **European mowing frequency meta‐analysis (≈30 studies)** – >1 cut yr⁻¹ modestly increases richness *vs.* single annual cut; biennial cuts acceptable compromise in low-resource scenarios (median loss ≈ 7 %).
3. **Herrero-Jáuregui et al. (2018)** – every step from moderate→high grazing reduces richness ~25 % regardless of rainfall; sub-moderate reductions give marginal gains (non-linear curve).

### 3.2 Key empirical take-homes
• **High productivity, fertilised or formerly arable sites**: mowing (especially early or multiple cuts) depletes standing biomass and exports nutrients quickly; grazing often leaves sufficient residual biomass/N to maintain tall dominants.

• **Sites with livestock-sensitive target taxa** (e.g. *Orchis*, *Gentiana*, low-rosette forbs): trampling and selective biting under grazing can disproportionately harm them; clean cuts avoid that.

• **Logistical constraints**: hobby farms, urban fringes, small parcels where fencing is impossible—the opportunity cost of establishing grazing outweighs mowing.

• **Socio-cultural objectives**: where hay for local farmers is valued, mowing doubles as forage provisioning, creating co-financing opportunities.

*Conclusion:* Neither practice is universally superior; benefits flip with productivity, target community, logistical envelope and risk tolerance.

## 4. Situations Where Mowing Is More Efficient (with Rationale)
### 4.1 Eutrophic Mesic Grasslands (<500 m a.s.l.)
• **Why:** Fast regrowth + high nutrient loan; frequent defoliation + nutrient export required; grazing animals often avoid N-rich tall grasses → insufficient suppression.
• **Best practice:** Two cuts: first late June (pre‐seed set of dominants), second Sept. Keep cut height ≤ 7 cm to expose soil microsites.

### 4.2 Wet Meadows & Fens
• **Why:** Hoofprints cause peat compaction; nutrient hotspots from dung accelerate sedge/grass dominance. Machine mowing on low-pressure tractors exports biomass without soil damage.

### 4.3 Fragmented Small Patches, Road Verges, Solar Parks
• **Why:** Grazing logistics prohibitive; autonomous or contracted mowing can achieve precise timing. Biodiversity response boosted if clippings removed.

### 4.4 Sites with Invasive Graminoids (*Molinia*, *Phragmites*)
• **Why:** High lignin makes them unpalatable; mowing followed by biomass removal lowers litter layer and light competition faster than herbivore browsing.

### 4.5 Where Uniform Disturbance Needed for Seedling Establishment (e.g. overseeding, Green Hay)
• **Why:** Even stubble and litter removal critical; grazing leaves patchy sward height and intact litter.

## 5. When Grazing Still Wins
For completeness, grazing remains superior on:
• **Low-productivity dry grasslands and alpine/alvar systems** — trampling creates micro-topography and patches of bare soil crucial for tiny annuals → mowing too gentle.
• **Systems reliant on heterogeneity to suppress single-species dominance** — e.g. calcareous grasslands where tussocks & lawns create niches.

## 6. Short- vs Long-Term Dynamics
Short-term (<5 yrs): mowing often yields rapid richness spikes by releasing suppressed forb seedbank if litter exported. Long-term (≥15 yrs): without spatio-temporal heterogeneity, mowing can level‐off richness; rotational or mosaic mowing or combined aftermath grazing re-inject heterogeneity.

## 7. Designing an Efficient Mowing Regime
1. **Frequency**  
   • High-productivity → 2–3 cuts; medium → 1; low → 1 biennially acceptable.  
2. **Timing**  
   • Vary across years to avoid phenological lock-in; alternate early/late to favour both spring and summer flowerers.  
3. **Cut Height**  
   • 5–7 cm typical; lower heights increase seedling light but raise soil heating/desiccation risk.  
4. **Spatial Mosaic**  
   • Leave 5–15 % uncut refugia each year for invertebrates.  
5. **Biomass Removal**  
   • Critical for nutrient export; baling must follow within 3 days to avoid re-translocation.  
6. **Monitoring**  
   • Photo-plots + point-intercept; trait-based metrics (CWM SLA) detect competitive release earlier than species counts.

## 8. Cost-Effectiveness Comparison (Indicative)
Assuming 10 ha temperate grassland:
| Cost category | Grazing (low-input cattle) | Mowing (contractor, 2 cuts) |
|---|---|---|
| Capital | £7,000 (fence, water) | £0 (machinery external) |
| Annual running | £2,800 (herding, vet) | £1,600 (contract) |
| Overheads | Compliance, inspections | Machinery scheduling |
| Biodiversity gain (Δspecies 5 yr) | +8 (±4) | +10 (±3) |
| Cost per species | £350 | £160 |

→ In this stylised case, mowing is ~2× more cost-efficient.

## 9. Hybrid & Contrarian Options
1. **Aftermath grazing** – Cut mid-summer, allow regrowth, light flock in autumn; best of both worlds: nutrient export + hoof gap creation.
2. **Strip/patch mowing** – Engineer heterogeneity; cut 50 % each year in chessboard layout.
3. **Robotic / electric mowers** – Useful for peri-urban reserves with noise/emission restrictions; can implement ultra-high frequency, low-intensity micro-cuts (speculative).
4. **Cut-and-Mulch, then Remove** – In coarse soils, mulching once can deposit fine litter that enhances germination; remove on second pass to export nutrients.

## 10. Decision Tree (Simplified)
```
Is site productivity high? ── yes ─► Mowing ≥1× yr; consider 2×
   │                                │
   └─ no                          Is patch size >40 ha & fencing feasible?
                                   │
                                   ├─ yes ─► Moderate grazing (0.3–0.5 LU ha⁻¹); optional mosaic mowing
                                   └─ no ─► Mowing (annual or biennial)
```

## 11. Knowledge Gaps & Future Tech (Flagged Speculation)
• **Drone-based LiDAR to quantify sward heterogeneity** and dynamically allocate mowing strips (early pilots in NL).  
• **Biochar from cut biomass** reintegrated to soils as carbon-negative restoration funding.  
• **Genomic monitoring** to see if mowing selects for shorter stature genotypes—requires long-term common-garden trials.

## 12. Key Recommendations for Practitioners
1. **Match disturbance tool to productivity and target species’ vulnerability.**  
2. **Export biomass**—the hidden lever where mowing beats grazing.  
3. **Build heterogeneity deliberately** via strip mosaics or combining tools; static annual mowing eventually plateaus.  
4. **Monitor traits, not just species counts**, to detect recovery trajectory early.  
5. **Budget realism:** upfront cost savings of mowing can finance extra monitoring, often neglected.

### Executive Summary
Mowing outperforms grazing primarily on **high‐nutrient, mesic or wet grasslands, small or logistically constrained sites, and where selective herbivory threatens target plants**. The advantages arise from: (i) larger nutrient export, (ii) controllable, uniform biomass removal, and (iii) lower risk of overgrazing. Efficiency declines where heterogeneity is critical or productivity is low. Hybrid regimes and technological innovations blur traditional boundaries, offering bespoke solutions. Practitioners should integrate monitoring and adaptive management to maintain gains over multi-decadal horizons.
