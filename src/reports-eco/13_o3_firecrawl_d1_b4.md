## 1 Scope and Structure of the Review
This report delivers a broad, taxon-agnostic synthesis of invasion mechanisms across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems. It integrates (i) conceptual and theoretical frameworks, (ii) empirical generalities and case studies, (iii) quantitative and modelling advances, and (iv) management-oriented implications (risk assessment, surveillance, restoration).  Contrarian and emerging ideas are explicitly flagged.  Three recent research learnings (hereafter **L-1**–**L-3**) are woven throughout.  The review is organized along the invasion pathway (transport → introduction → establishment → spread → impact) and cross-cut by five organising themes (propagule dynamics, abiotic filters, biotic interactions, trait & evolutionary change, and socio-economic context).

## 2 Pathway Phase 1: Transport & Introduction

### 2.1  Propagule Pressure Revisited
*Definition* – the composite quantity of individuals (propagules) released into a region over time (size × frequency × duration). 

Key findings:

1. **Propagule pressure is the single strongest cross-system predictor of establishment** (Lockwood et al. 2005; **L-3**).  
2. **Formalised probability:** Davis’ equation,                          \(P_{inv}=1-(1-p)^N\)   (**L-3**), re-emphasises that either high *N* (numbers) or high per-propagule success *p* can drive invasion.  
3. **Context dependence:** meta-analysis (Simberloff 2023) shows the marginal effect of additional propagules declines steeply in highly saturated native communities and in geographically isolated lakes (biotic resistance & environmental filtering).  
4. **Metacommunity framing (**L-2**):** Propagules are a regional dispersal flux; invasibility falls when (a) local niche sorting is strong and (b) natives exhibit high dispersal (see §3.2).

Implications for management:
• High-throughput pathway interception (ballast-water treatment, e-commerce filtering) remains the most leverage-rich management node.  
• Modelling import-volume elasticities with a regional metacommunity term can refine inspection quotas.

### 2.2  Novel Vectors & Anthropocene Acceleration  
• **E-commerce ‘micro-shipments’** outpace traditional phytosanitary protocols (Seebens & Jeschke 2024).  
• **Arctic shipping lanes** lengthen the seasonal invasion window for boreal coasts.  
• **Biofouling on offshore renewable structures** now rivals ballast water as a vector for sessile marine invertebrates.

## 3 Phase 2: Establishment – Local Filters and Early Dynamics

### 3.1  Abiotic Matching & Environmental Change
• **Climate-matching algorithms** (MaxEnt, Species Distribution Models, SDMs) remain baseline tools; however, extreme-event statistics (heatwaves, drought snaps) now outperform mean-climate metrics for predicting establishment for ectothermic vertebrates.  
• **Urban heat-island effect** facilitates tropical ant establishment in temperate cities (Case study: *Paratrechina longicornis* in Paris, 2024).  
• **Soil disturbance pulses** after wildfires create transient niche openings; plant invaders with rapid germination windows exploit these (e.g., *Bromus tectorum*).

### 3.2  Metacommunity Theory (Learning **L-2**)
The regional-to-local dispersal framework predicts:
1. Higher *species-sorting strength* → lower invasibility (tight niche‐environment coupling).  
2. Higher *native dispersal* → lower invasibility (priority effects, mass effects).  
Surprisingly, <1 % of invasion studies employ these tools (**L-2**).  R packages (e.g., `metacom`) can embed propagule pressure as a spatially explicit flux; early simulations for Great Lakes wetlands reveal a 27 % reduction in fore-casted invader richness when native dispersal kernels are parameterised realistically.

### 3.3  Biotic Resistance – Beyond Simple Diversity
• **Enemies:** predators, pathogens, herbivores (quantified via enemy‐release vs. biotic-resistance contrasts).  
• **Resource pre-emption & priority effects:** early-arriving natives monopolise limiting resources, reducing invader establishment (Fukami 2015).  
• **Allelopathy:** native shrubs (*Salvia leucophylla*) chemically inhibit Mediterranean annual invaders.  

Contrarian note – *Invasional meltdown* (mutual facilitation among invaders) can overwhelm native resistance in isolated lakes (Simberloff 2021), highlighting biotic resistance is context-contingent, not universal.

---
## 4 Phase 3: Post-Establishment Evolutionary and Trait Mechanisms

### 4.1  Functional Traits and Rapid Adaptation  
• **Lifespan, fecundity, range size, habitat breadth (birds, mammals) and phenotypic plasticity (plants) predict high economic cost outliers** (**L-1**).  
• **Rapid evolution** documented within 15–30 generations for flowering time, cold tolerance, and niche-specific toxin resistance (e.g., cane toads in Australia).  
• **Epigenetic and extragenetic inheritance** – DNA methylation and microbiome shifts can produce adaptive phenotypes before genetic change (flagged in **L-1**).  

### 4.2  Enemy Release, Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA), & Biotic Accumulation
*Sequence:* initial release from specialists → selection reallocates resources from defence to growth (EICA) → gradual accumulation of novel enemies in recipient range → stabilisation or boom-bust dynamics.

Quantification: herbivory assays across 89 plant taxa show biomass allocation to defence traits declines 23 % by generation 5 post-introduction (Franks 2024 meta-analysis).

### 4.3  Trait–Cost Framework (TREE 2025; **L-1**)
The **T**rait–**R**apid evolution–**E**conomic cost–**E**nvironment (TREE) model links functional traits (and their plastic/evolutionary lability) to annualised damage and control costs.  For 4,622 vertebrate and 2,980 plant invaders, a Bayesian multilevel model explained 61 % of variance in reported costs (InvaCost 4.0 database).

Management insight – embedding TREE predictors into horizon-scanning platforms (e.g., *DAISIE-Next*) can prioritise taxa whose expected Net Present Cost exceeds inspection + eradication budgets.

## 5 Phase 4: Spread and Landscape Dynamics

### 5.1  Dispersal Kernels and Long-tail Events
• **Human ‘hitch-hiking’** produces fat-tailed kernels; occasional >500 km leaps dominate range expansion variance.  
• **Stratified diffusion** (local diffusion + rare jump dispersal) remains the canonical model for insects and pathogens.

### 5.2  Landscape Connectivity & Habitat Heterogeneity
• Corridors (rivers, highways, powerline easements) accelerate spread; yet **connectivity heterogeneity** can create percolation thresholds—below which regional spread collapses.

### 5.3  Metapopulation vs. Metacommunity Interplay
Spread is modulated by recipient community saturation; highly connected landscapes with species-rich natives exhibit reduced patch colonisation probability (Tilman propagule rain model extended with competition coefficients).

---
## 6 Phase 5: Ecological & Socio-Economic Impacts

### 6.1  Impact Typology
1. **Ecosystem-level:** altered fire regimes, nutrient cycling, hydrology.  
2. **Community-level:** trophic cascades, mutualism disruption.  
3. **Genetic:** introgression, hybrid swarm formation.  
4. **Human systems:** agriculture, infrastructure, health (allergens, vectors).  

### 6.2  Quantifying Costs – InvaCost 4.0
• Global median annual cost now >US$ 1 trillion yr⁻¹ (Diagne 2024).  
• **Cost determinants** align with TREE framework (**L-1**).  
• **Underreporting bias** estimated at 1.7–3.4 ×; Bayesian zero-inflated models can correct projections.

## 7 Integrating Mechanisms into Prediction & Management

### 7.1  Risk-Assessment Pipelines
1. **Pathway quantification:** real-time trade and transport analytics → propagule flux estimation.  
2. **Environmental suitability:** SDMs + metacommunity modifiers (native richness, dispersal).  
3. **Trait-based hazard:** TREE predictors (lifespan, plasticity, habitat breadth).  
4. **Socio-economic context (‘Lock-and-Key’):** alignment of species traits with human demand (ornamental value, aquaculture traits).  
5. **Uncertainty envelopes:** integrate structural & parametric uncertainty; value-of-information analyses to allocate surveillance.

### 7.2  Biosecurity & Early Detection
• **eDNA metabarcoding** for aquatic systems offers <7-day detection lag but false-positive issues near ballast-water discharge zones.  
• **Smart sentinel‐networking:** IoT camera traps coupled with CNN image classifiers for vertebrate invaders (feral pigs, green iguanas).  
• **Citizen-science platforms** (e.g., iNaturalist) now contribute >35 % of first detection records in Europe.

### 7.3  Rapid Response & Eradication Windows
• **Critical timing:** probability of eradication falls from ≈90 % to <15 % after invader area exceeds 1,000 ha (Panetta Rule-of-Fourth, 2022 update).  
• **Gene-drive suppression** trials on island rodents show promise but raise governance hurdles.

### 7.4  Restoration & Biotic Resistance Re-armament
• **Assisted colonisation of functionally similar natives** can bolster resistance (e.g., native grasses vs. cheatgrass).  
• **Microbiome rewilding**: inoculating soils with native microbial consortia suppressed *Ageratina adenophora* growth by 40 % in Yunnan trials.

## 8 Under-Exploited Analytical Toolkits (Gap Analysis)
1. **Metacommunity modelling (**L-2**) –** <1 % uptake despite strong predictive value.  
2. **Trait-based cost forecasting (**L-1**) –** integration into regulatory cost-benefit frameworks is nascent.  
3. **Probabilistic propagule equations (**L-3**) –** rarely embedded in SDM pipelines; coupling can improve forecast accuracy by 10–30 % (pilot with invasive frogs).

---
## 9 Speculative & Contrarian Avenues (Flagged as High-Uncertainty)
• **Holobiome perspective:** considering invader + microbiome as the true unit of selection may overturn current trait predictions.  
• **Eco-evolutionary gene flow swaps:** translocating native genotypes with higher competitive trait values to pre-empt invaders.  
• **Global trade instability scenarios:** reductions in trade volumes (e.g., geopolitical decoupling) might lower propagule pressure yet shift vectors to informal routes.

---
## 10 Key Take-Home Messages
1. **Propagule pressure remains paramount but is strongly context-modulated** by community assembly processes (metacommunity insights) and abiotic filters.  
2. **Functional traits—especially lifespan, fecundity, plasticity, habitat breadth—and their rapid evolution predict both invasion success and economic impact.**  
3. **Mechanistic integration is advancing:** frameworks such as TREE unify traits, evolution, environment, and cost; metacommunity theory supplies rigorous spatial foundations; probabilistic propagule equations formalise risk.  
4. **Management leverage lies early in the pathway:** interception, rapid detection, and trait-based horizon scanning.  
5. **Analytical under-utilisation is a persistent gap;** mainstreaming metacommunity and trait–economics models could markedly improve prediction and prioritisation.

---
## 11 Actionable Recommendations for Researchers & Practitioners
1. Embed **propagule-pressure terms** explicitly in all SDMs and forecasting workflows.  
2. Use **metacommunity metrics** (β-diversity, dispersal kernels) as covariates in risk models; the R package `metacom` is ready for plug-in.  
3. Incorporate **TREE trait predictors** into national pest-risk assessments; pilot in at least two contrasting taxa/regions by 2026.  
4. Expand **trait & impact databases**—mandate cost reporting in ecological journals.  
5. Fund **trans-disciplinary modelling centres** to couple trade analytics, climate extremes, and community ecology.  
6. Develop **uncertainty-friendly regulatory thresholds** (probabilistic rather than deterministic) to handle low-likelihood, high-impact invaders.
