# Final Report: Integrated Approaches to Monitoring and Managing Snow Goose Populations While Preserving Food Security for Arctic Indigenous Communities

This report synthesizes extensive learnings from a multi-disciplinary body of research that spans remote sensing technologies, traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), policy analysis, and community-based management across the Arctic and Subarctic. The goal is to develop an adaptive, integrated framework for monitoring and managing snow goose populations while addressing food security challenges faced by indigenous communities. This document is structured into distinct sections covering monitoring strategies, ecological dynamics, policy frameworks, and community engagement with an emphasis on multi-stakeholder integration.

## 1. Overview and Context

Arctic indigenous communities rely on subsistence activities for food security, and disruptions by wildlife populations—particularly snow geese—can significantly alter the delicate balance between harvesting practices and ecosystem sustainability. Indigenous communities across regions such as Nunavut, Alaska, and other Arctic areas have expressed the need to monitor wildlife populations with scientific precision while retaining control over local resource management. The following sections detail advanced monitoring approaches and management strategies recommended to reconcile both ecological and socio-political objectives.

## 2. Advanced Monitoring Technologies and Their Integration with TEK

### 2.1. Remote Sensing and Drone Imagery

Modern remote sensing platforms—including Sentinel-1/2 satellites and RGB drone systems, as well as thermal infrared cameras—are proving pivotal in capturing habitat dynamics. Research indicates that drone imagery combined with photogrammetry and telemetry data achieves an accuracy of 88.8% to 92% in distinguishing up to 15 vegetation classes. This high-resolution mapping capability is essential not only for tracking natural processes like snowmelt progression but also for detecting vegetation disturbances caused by snow goose activities. By correlating vegetation change metrics with snowmelt timing, managers can predict shifts in habitat quality.

### 2.2. Telemetry, Individual Tracking, and Process-Based Approaches

Advanced telemetry systems, including individualized tracking via heart-rate loggers, allow researchers to quantify habitat use and energetic expenditures for geese. These data help establish dynamics within trophic interactions, particularly in sensitive high-Arctic wetlands where snow goose grazing has been documented to remove up to 40% of the standing vegetation. Integrating these methods with traditional ecological knowledge offers a level of granularity and adaptive insight that is crucial in rapidly changing ecological contexts.

### 2.3. Integrative Frameworks Merging Scientific and Indigenous Knowledge

Interviews and collaborative analyses with indigenous stakeholders underscore the effectiveness of an integration framework that seamlessly combines modern data collection methods with local knowledge. For example, network and qualitative content analyses involving 29 Arctic experts illustrate that merging systems-based perspectives (which emphasize decision-making, conservation, and change detection) with process-based approaches (focusing on cooperation, learning, and education) enables more robust wildlife management outcomes. This synergy is essential for tailoring monitoring systems in places such as Arviat and Coral Harbour in Nunavut, where co-management strategies are foundational.

## 3. Ecological Dynamics and the Impacts of Snow Goose Populations

### 3.1. Trophic Interactions and Habitat Disturbance

Snow geese play a critical role in Arctic ecosystem dynamics. In ecosystems like the tundra wetlands on Bylot Island, Nunavut, the grazing intensity (removing nearly 40% of standing vegetation in certain seasons) has cascading effects on plant community composition and overall habitat quality. Additionally, predator-prey relationships involving species like arctic foxes and cyclic lemming populations can amplify the ecological impact of fluctuating goose populations, contributing to significant annual variability in goose productivity. Recognizing these ecological complexities is vital in forming adaptive management plans.

### 3.2. Comparative Analysis with Global Practices

Insights from regions such as mid-Norway and Svalbard offer valuable adaptive management practices. In these regions, strategies like subsidy adjustments for farmers and liberal hunting regulations have mitigated conflicts generated by overabundant goose populations. Empirical data suggest that these management practices can lead to significant ecological consequences, including up to a 61% reduction in aboveground biomass over two decades. Such case studies highlight the potential benefits and pitfalls of integrating commercial and conservation objectives.

## 4. Policy Frameworks and Community-Based Management Strategies

### 4.1. Integrated Policy Interventions

Policy frameworks such as the Nunavut Harvester Support Program (NHSP) exemplify effective integration of wildlife management with food security initiatives. By combining mechanisms like Country Food Markets, Food Acquisition Programs, School Meals, and innovative approaches like arctic greenhouses, these initiatives provide a multifaceted response to food insecurity while considering the long-term impacts of climate change on traditional hunting practices. Similar frameworks are being piloted in multiple communities, carefully balancing immediate food security concerns with adaptability to ecological shifts.

### 4.2. Legal and Administrative Reforms

Scenario planning and legal reform initiatives are crucial. Case studies from Krasnoyarsk Krai and multi-stakeholder workshops in Southwest Yukon demonstrate that structured dialogues can overcome legislative gaps and historical power imbalances. Establishing Traditional Nature Management Areas provides an institutional mechanism by which indigenous voices gain more central decision-making roles in wildlife governance. Correcting misaligned administrative practices—like culturally inappropriate safety protocols and bureaucratic inefficiencies—is essential for effective co-management.

### 4.3. Multi-Stakeholder, Community-Based Collaborations

Integrating local indigenous practices with academic and governmental insights has proven effective in regions like Fairbanks (Alaska), Whitehorse (Yukon), and the Barents region. These collaborative efforts are complemented by initiatives in food sovereignty, including hydroponics, vertical farming, and greenhouse innovations. Such approaches not only enhance food production but also reduce the pressure on traditional wild harvests. In the Canadian and Russian Arctic, multisector collaborations on monitoring other key species such as common eider ducks and muskox/caribou have set precedents for inclusive co-management strategies.

## 5. Proposed Adaptive Management Framework

Based on the comprehensive learnings detailed above, the following multi-tiered adaptive management framework is proposed:

### 5.1. Data Collection and Monitoring Layer

- Deploy a combination of remote sensing (Sentinel satellites, drone imagery, thermal cameras) and field-based telemetry to develop high-resolution ecological maps.
- Integrate individualized tracking data to understand energy use and habitat preferences. Data should be refreshed periodically to capture rapid climatic changes.
- Utilize photogrammetry and network analysis methods to seamlessly merge empirical data with TEK insights.

### 5.2. Policy and Community Engagement Layer

- Develop integrated policy programs like the NHSP that incorporate local food security methods (e.g., Country Food Markets and arctic greenhouses) with wildlife conservation initiatives.
- Facilitate structured multi-stakeholder workshops and legal reform discussions to establish Traditional Nature Management Areas that empower indigenous communities.
- Implement multi-sector co-management partnerships ensuring that indigenous governance is central to decision-making processes.

### 5.3. Adaptive Feedback and Iterative Learning Layer

- Continuously merge process-based monitoring (e.g., adaptive management decisions based on real-time data) with systems-based high-level directives (e.g., long-term ecosystem conservation goals).
- Institute regular scenario planning sessions that incorporate new ecological findings and climatic predictions. This ensures consistent refinement of management practices.
- Integrate continuous feedback from field observations, remote sensors, and community reports to update monitoring protocols.

### 5.4. Capacity Building and Technological Integration

- Invest in capacity building initiatives for indigenous communities, including training in remote sensing operations and data management.
- Leverage modern technologies such as machine learning algorithms to analyze complex datasets, thereby enhancing predictive modeling for goose population trends and vegetation disturbances.

## 6. Conclusions and Future Directions

The robust integration of advanced monitoring technologies with traditional ecological knowledge represents a paradigm shift in the management of snow goose populations in Arctic regions. The strategic framework outlined herein not only targets ecological sustainability but also prioritizes food security for indigenous communities. Key takeaways include:

- The necessity of high-resolution, multi-source data (remote sensing, telemetry, drone imagery) to monitor short-term environmental changes and long-term ecosystem shifts.
- The critical role of TEK and co-management practices in aligning conservation goals with indigenous self-determination and food sovereignty.
- The effectiveness of an integrated policy approach that combines adaptive legal frameworks, community-based management strategies, and modern technology-driven monitoring.

As climate change continues its rapid influence on Arctic ecosystems, adaptive management frameworks must remain agile. Future research should focus on improving data integration algorithms, expanding legal reforms based on multi-stakeholder feedback, and enhancing capacity building initiatives within indigenous communities. Additionally, exploring contrarian ideas—such as decentralized data stewardship or blockchain-based verification of indigenous knowledge claims—may provide innovative paths forward.

In conclusion, this integrated approach offers a scalable and adaptive blueprint for ensuring ecological balance and food security in the Arctic under conditions of increasing environmental uncertainty.
