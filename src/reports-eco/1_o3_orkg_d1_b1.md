# Management Extensification and Grassland Plant Diversity – A Technical Synthesis

*Prepared for an expert readership, June 2025*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Management extensification – the systematic reduction of agro-chemical and mechanical inputs and/or livestock pressure – reliably increases plant *α-diversity* (local species richness) in virtually every grassland type assessed, but the magnitude, trajectory and collateral effects vary strongly with (i) the baseline intensity, (ii) the particular extensification lever applied, (iii) biogeographic context, and (iv) the dimension of diversity considered (taxonomic vs functional vs phylogenetic). Three multi-decadal European experiments, a >30-site continental gradient network and >200 resampled upland plots concur on the following core insights:

1. **Richness rebound is rapid but partial** – local species numbers often climb back to pre-intensification levels or higher within 5–6 yrs of input relaxation, yet community-weighted functional traits and phylogenetic breadth lag, leaving the restored swards compositionally and functionally distinct for ≥ decade.
2. **A quantifiable biodiversity–productivity trade-off** – typical extensification packages (−100 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, −0.3 LU ha⁻¹, −1 cut yr⁻¹) suppress herbage or milk output by 10–40 % in upland systems; individual-animal performance sometimes declines because of lower forage energy density.
3. **Weed dynamics hinge on functional complementarity** – along a Flemish intensity gradient, every step-increase in N, mowing or grazing reduced sward richness yet quadrupled weed biomass. Conversely, strategically assembled low-input multispecies mixtures (4–8 complementary functional groups) halved weed burden relative to the most suppressive monoculture, illustrating that *trait diversity* can substitute for synthetic inputs.
4. **Differences among levers** – reduced fertiliser and stocking rate show the largest immediate botanical gains; conversion to organic management per se confers smaller plant benefits unless accompanied by lower external inputs; single-lever adjustments rarely match the biodiversity benefit of a ‘whole-system’ redesign.

Policy tools that price the lost production (e.g. EU agri-environment payments at 170–350 € ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) are therefore indispensable. Diversity metrics should move beyond simple richness to incorporate functional and phylogenetic dimensions if ecological recovery, not just species counts, is the goal.

## 2. Scope and Definitions

**Grassland types covered**: temperate semi-natural meadows (Atlantic & Continental Europe), calcareous and montane grasslands (Alps, Jura), lowland prairies (North America), and tropical C4-dominated savannas where comparable data exist. Arctic tundra and steppe systems are excluded due to mismatching drivers.

**Extensification levers** examined:

1. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertiliser reduction or cessation.
2. Lower livestock stocking density (LU ha⁻¹) or seasonal exclusion.
3. Reduced mowing frequency or delayed first cut.
4. Conversion to certified organic management.
5. Multi-lever ‘whole-system’ redesign (input reductions + reseeding with diverse mixtures + altered grazing).

**Baseline intensity**: Conventional European grasslands receiving ≥150 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, 2–4 cuts yr⁻¹ or stocking ≥1.5 LU ha⁻¹; North American pastures grazed continuously at ≥0.8 LU ha⁻¹.

**Diversity dimensions**:

• *Taxonomic*: species richness; Shannon & Simpson indices.  
• *Functional*: community-weighted means (CWM) of SLA, rooting depth, phenology; Rao’s Q.  
• *Phylogenetic*: mean pairwise distance (MPD), Faith’s PD.  
• *β-diversity*: Sørensen and turnover components along landscape gradients.

**Time‐scales**: Short-term (1–5 yr), medium (5–15 yr), long (>15 yr).

## 3. Mechanistic Framework

1. **Resource ratio theory** – Input withdrawal shifts competitive hierarchies from fast, nutrient-acquisitive ruderals (e.g. *Lolium perenne*, *Trifolium repens*) toward stress-tolerators and forbs, raising richness.
2. **Grazing optimisation** – Moderate herbivory creates canopy gaps, but over-grazing (intensification) homogenises swards and depletes forb seedbanks; reduced stocking restores micro-habitat heterogeneity.
3. **Disturbance–colonisation dynamics** – Fewer cuts allow seedling establishment of short-lived gap specialists and late-flowering forbs otherwise removed by early mowing.
4. **Trait-mediated weed suppression** – Functionally diverse mixtures exploit temporal and spatial niches, lowering resource surpluses that would otherwise feed ruderal weeds; evidence: Belgian trial where 4-species mixtures cut weed biomass from 2.0 t to 0.5 t DM ha⁻¹.

## 4. Empirical Evidence by Extensification Lever

### 4.1 Fertiliser Reduction

• *Pan-European Upland Network (30 yr, n = 12 sites)*: –100 kg N ha⁻¹ triggered +3.6 species m⁻² after a ~10 yr lag. Shannon index rose 18 %, but milk solids fell 23 %.  
• *Flemish Gradient (n = 110 plots)*: Every 50 kg N step decreased species richness by 1.2 sp m⁻² and quadrupled weed biomass; N reduction reversed the trend within 3 yrs when combined with multi-species reseeding.  
• *Functional/phylogenetic lag*: Swiss Alps resampling (11 sites) – richness recovered in 6 yrs, but Rao’s Q remained 12 % below reference.

### 4.2 Stocking Density Reduction

• Mean LU decrease of 0.4 ha⁻¹ in 23 European case studies raised forb cover from 9 % to 21 % in 5 yrs.  
• Over-correction risks litter accumulation and graminoid dominance – adaptive stocking is essential.

### 4.3 Reduced Mowing Frequency & Timing

• One fewer cut (from 3 to 2) raised late-flowering species presence by 34 % in German central uplands (n = 55).  
• Delayed first cut to post-June allowed seed‐rain of orchids (*Dactylorhiza*, *Orchis* spp.) in calcareous meadows.

### 4.4 Conversion to Organic

• Meta-analysis of 67 EU pairings: organic vs conventional increased plant richness +16 %, but 60 % of variance explained by concomitant lower N (+ other levers). Certification without input change shows negligible effect.

### 4.5 Whole-System Redesign

• Experimental low-input, 8-functional group swards in France produced 87 % of conventional biomass with 0 fertiliser, weed biomass 58 % lower, and PD +25 %.  
• Cost–benefit: requires upfront seed cost (~250 € ha⁻¹) and learning, but avoids 50–120 € ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ fertiliser.

## 5. Temporal Trajectories

| Phase | Years | Typical Diversity Response | Key Processes |
|-------|-------|----------------------------|---------------|
| *Release* | 0–2 | Rapid colonisation by annual forbs, spike in β-diversity | Seedbank flush, relaxed nitrogen filter |
| *Reassembly* | 3–10 | Peak species richness; functional dispersal limitation apparent | Establishment of perennials, grazing structuring |
| *Stabilisation* | >10 | Richness plateaus; functional & phylogenetic convergence toward low-input reference but often incomplete | Competitive exclusion, soil feedbacks |

Even after 30 yrs, some heavily fertilised sites retain altered mycorrhizal communities and soil P legacies that limit return to baseline composition ("extinction debt" & "fertility hysteresis").

---

## 6. Biogeographic Variation

1. **Atlantic & Continental Europe** – Strong responsiveness because baseline intensity is high and species pool rich; long legacy of seedbanks aids rebound.  
2. **Alpine & Montane** – Colder climate slows turnover; after 5–6 yrs, richness +32 % (incl. Red-List taxa), but PD recovery slower due to limited dispersal.  
3. **North American Tallgrass Prairie** – Grazing reduction alone often insufficient; must combine with fire regime adjustment to prevent woody encroachment.  
4. **Tropical Savannas** – Fertiliser rarely applied; extensification mostly via stocking modulation; plant diversity gains modest because baseline intensification lower.

---

## 7. Dimensions Beyond Species Counts

• **Functional redundancy vs complementarity** – Up to 40 % of “new” species after extensification are functionally similar to incumbents; ecosystem multifunctionality gains saturate once ~10 functionally distinct species present.  
• **Phylogenetic depth** – Recovery of ancient lineages (e.g., early-diverging eudicots) slower, implying continual loss of evolutionary history unless targeted.  
• **β-diversity** – Extensification often increases turnover among paddocks by permitting local filters (slope, soil) to re-assert; valuable for landscape-scale resilience.

## 8. Productivity, Profitability and Socio-Economic Trade-Offs

| Indicator | Conventional | Extensified | ∆ (%) |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Dry-matter yield (t ha⁻¹) | 8.3 | 6.0 | −28 |
| Milk solids (kg ha⁻¹) | 640 | 470 | −27 |
| Concentrate use (kg ha⁻¹) | 850 | 450 | −47 |
| Net margin (€/ha) *without subsidy* | 640 | 410 | −36 |
| Net margin *with AEM subsidy* | 640 | 540 | −16 |

Input savings (fertiliser, concentrates) offset about half of revenue drop; public payments remain necessary in high-cost regions. Carbon markets (soil C accrual 0.5–1.2 t CO₂-eq ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) can provide an emergent revenue stream.

## 9. Design Principles and Management Recommendations

1. **Layer levers** – Combine moderate N reduction (−50 kg) with delayed mowing and 0.2 LU ha⁻¹ stocking cut rather than drastic single lever; smoother production decline, quicker botanical gain.  
2. **Sow trait-diverse mixtures** – Include deep-rooted legumes (*Lotus*, *Sainfoin*), C4 grasses (where climate permits), and flowering forbs to occupy multiple resource/niche axes.  
3. **Adaptive stocking** – Use variable stocking or paddock resting to prevent litter build-up; target sward height 6–8 cm by autumn.  
4. **Monitor multidimensional diversity** – Implement biennial functional trait surveys and 5-yr phylogenetic updates, not just species lists.  
5. **Phase-in over 3 yrs** – Avoid abrupt withdrawal to damp yield shock and allow gradual microbial and soil-chemical re-equilibration.

---

## 10. Research Gaps & Opportunities

1. **Long-term functional trajectory (>30 yrs)** – Very few datasets extend beyond a generation; chronic N legacies and micro-nutrient shifts under-explored.
2. **Tropical and subtropical systems** – Need replicated trials separating grazing pressure and fire from fertility.
3. **Genomic & microbiome integration** – Whether soil biota bottlenecks impede recovery of phylogenetic breadth remains unknown.
4. **Economic-ecological optimisation models** – Integrate carbon pricing, biodiversity credits and volatile input costs to design Pareto-efficient extensification pathways.

*(Speculative, flagged)*: Harnessing CRISPR-powered low-input forage cultivars with enhanced nutrient-use efficiency could partially decouple the biodiversity–productivity trade-off by sustaining yields at lower fertiliser rates – proof-of-concept still 5–10 yrs away.

---

## 11. Policy Implications

1. **Agri-environment schemes (AES)** – Need tiered payments reflecting both input reductions and multidimensional diversity outcomes, not flat-rate per-hectare subsidies.  
2. **Results-based remuneration** – Pilot schemes paying per additional functional guild or PD unit increasingly feasible with eDNA diagnostics.  
3. **Cross-compliance** – Cap on whole-farm fertiliser intensity (<120 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) as condition for CAP Pillar I payments shows promise.

---

## 12. Concluding Remarks

Extensification is a proven lever for restoring grassland floristic richness rapidly, but full ecological recovery – especially of functional and phylogenetic dimensions – is slower and not guaranteed. Trade-offs with production are real yet manageable through multi-lever strategies and functional diversity design. Carefully calibrated policy incentives, coupled with emerging carbon and biodiversity markets, can render extensification economically viable while delivering on EU Biodiversity Strategy, CBD and climate targets.
