*(comparative synthesis across managed honey bees, wild bumblebees and diverse solitary taxa)*

## Executive Summary  
1. **Warming alters both the *timing* and the *energetic cost* of overwintering.**  In solitary adult-wintering mason bees (*Osmia lignaria/cornuta/bicornis*) a mere +450 degree-day shift between eclosion and first frost increased metabolic expenditure 1.5-fold, doubled lipid loss and raised winter mortality by 19 %.  
2. **Life stage at which overwintering occurs is the primary predictor of vulnerability.**  Cross-species growth-chamber experiments show prepupal-wintering species mainly experience phenological advancement under +5 °C, whereas adult-winterers exhibit steeper drops in body size and post-emergence lifespan.  
3. **Thermal regime during winter controls diapause progression.**  For *O. lignaria* diapause ends when respiration rises to ≈0.45 ml g⁻¹ h⁻¹; storage at 7 °C reaches this threshold sooner (earlier emergence) but at the cost of heavy energetic depletion.  
4. **Climate interacts synergistically with pesticides.**  Warm-wintered *O. cornuta* females exposed orally to sulfoxaflor (11.64 ng bee⁻¹) suffered a 70 % reduction in longevity—evidence that warming can magnify chemical stress.  
5. **Landscape-scale modelling capacity now exists.**  The ALMaSS-*Osmia bicornis* and LandscapePhenoBee agent-based platforms integrate temperature-driven phenology, energetics and landscape floral dynamics, positioning the field for mechanistic risk assessment under IPCC scenarios.  
6. **Management levers are available but under-used:** provisioning thermal refugia, selecting longer-diapause genotypes, landscape diversification to buffer phenological mismatch, and micro-climate engineering in managed systems.  
7. **Knowledge gaps:** high-resolution overwinter microclimate datasets, diapause gene regulatory networks, interactive effects of drought and winter warm spells on bumblebee queens, and socio-economic feedbacks on beekeeper practices.

## 1  Introduction  
The overwintering period acts as a bottleneck for bee population dynamics in temperate and boreal biomes.  Climate change manifests chiefly as warmer autumns, variable winter cold spells, and earlier springs—conditions that reshuffle the delicate pacing of diapause induction, maintenance, and termination.  This report synthesises mechanistic insights and model results from the past decade, with particular emphasis on recent agent-based simulation frameworks and empirical energetics work on mason bees.  A comparative lens is applied across managed honey bees (*Apis mellifera*), social bumblebees (*Bombus* spp.), and solitary bees.

## 2  Overwintering Strategies by Taxon  
### 2.1 Managed Honey Bees (*Apis mellifera*)  
• Super-organismal thermoregulation; workers form clusters and actively shiver to hold 18–35 °C.  
• Diapause absent; survival depends on honey stores, varroa load, viral titres, and beekeeper interventions.  
• Climate link: warmer winters increase colony metabolic rate, promote late-season brood rearing (hindering oxalic acid treatments), and exacerbate varroa reproduction cycles.  
  
### 2.2 Bumblebees (*Bombus* spp.)  
• Only mated gynes overwinter solitarily in soil at 0–6 °C.  
• Diapause is facultative and hormonally regulated (juvenile hormone, insulin-TOR).  
• Warming shortens diapause, advances spring emergence, and increases winter water loss; extreme drought reduces floral resources as simulated in LandscapePhenoBee.  
  
### 2.3 Solitary Bees  
• Diverse life stages: prepupal (*Megachile rotundata*), adult (*Osmia*), larval (some *Andrena*).  
• Maternal cues such as photoperiod (e.g. long days in *M. rotundata* reduce diapause incidence) integrate with thermal history.  
• Adult-wintering species are especially sensitive to pre-winter warmth (energetic drain) and winter temperature (diapause advancement).

## 3  Mechanistic Pathways of Climate Impact  
### 3.1 Pre-Winter Phase  
• Delayed frost extends the *preparatory* interval between adult eclosion and cold onset.  ALMaSS-based scenarios show that every +100 degree-days increases *O. lignaria* lipid depletion by ≈8 %.  
• Southern genotypes compensate by genetically longer prepupal “summer” dormancy—adaptive potential worth exploiting in breeding programs.  
  
### 3.2 Diapause Maintenance  
• Respiration in *O. lignaria* drops to 0.1 ml g⁻¹ h⁻¹ within 30 d, then climbs logarithmically.  Warmer storage (7 °C) accelerates the climb, terminating diapause sooner; non-chilled bees suffer catastrophic mortality by mid-winter.  
• For bumblebees, intermittent mid-winter thaws induce metabolic spikes and heighten dehydration risk; field data suggest +2 °C winters can cut gyne fat reserves by >25 %.  
  
### 3.3 Diapause Termination & Phenology  
• In mason bees, emergence is triggered once the 0.45 ml g⁻¹ h⁻¹ respiration threshold is combined with a subsequent ≥15 °C exposure.  A 6 °C overwintering increase advanced emergence by several days, but mass-loss slopes steepened.  
• Across taxa, smaller individuals delay emergence despite identical temperatures—body-condition gating.  
  
### 3.4 Synergistic Stressors  
• Sulfoxaflor × warm winter example: 70 % longevity loss in *O. cornuta*.  
• In honey bees, higher winter temperature accelerates varroa reproduction and deforms-wing virus spread—compounded by pesticide sensitivity.

## 4  Model-Based Insights  
### 4.1 ALMaSS-*Osmia bicornis*  
• Daily timestep, explicit overwinter mortality modules (background, open-cell parasitism).  
• Optimal Allocation Theory governs offspring size vs. number trade-offs.  
• Being evaluated by EFSA for pesticide risk—could be extended to climate-stress scenarios by feeding EURO-CORDEX time series.  
  
### 4.2 LandscapePhenoBee (Bombus)  
• Couples foraging energetics, landscape flowering phenology (GDD-driven), and extreme weather.  
• Simulation shows that semi-natural habitat >20 % buffers drought-year colony size by 30–40 %.  
  
### 4.3 Emergent Principle: Life Stage Filter  
• Meta-analysis confirms overwinter life stage is the best categorical predictor of warming response (R² ≈ 0.46).  This can inform trait-based risk screening.

## 5  Ecological and Agricultural Consequences  
1. **Pollination Mismatch:** advanced mason bee emergence may precede peak bloom of early-flowering fruit trees if chilling requirements of trees remain unchanged.  
2. **Body Size Shrinkage:** adult-winterers lose mass; smaller females provision fewer or smaller daughters, depressing next-generation reproductive output.  
3. **Population Viability:** ALMaSS outputs project up to 45 % decline in *O. bicornis* nest density under RCP 8.5 solely from overwinter energetics, even before pesticide exposure.  
4. **Managed Pollination Services:** for *M. rotundata*, hotter maternal photoperiod (greenhouse seed production) may suppress diapause, causing asynchrony with alfalfa bloom.

## 6  Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies  
### 6.1 Micro-Climate Engineering  
• For managed cavity-nesting bees, insulate blocks or refrigerate cocoons at 2–4 °C after eclosion; end storage two weeks before bloom.  
• Field shelters (north-facing slopes, shaded hedgerows) can reduce late-summer thermal load, limiting premature diapause termination.  
  
### 6.2 Genetic & Breeding Approaches  
• Select or import southern genotypes with extended prepupal diapause for regions experiencing warmer autumns.  Requires strict disease screening.  
• Marker-assisted selection on diapause duration genes (e.g. insulin-TOR variants in *Bombus*).  
  
### 6.3 Landscape Management  
• Maintain ≥20 % semi-natural cover; heterogeneity buffers phenological mismatch by providing continuous floral overlap.  
• Incorporate early- and late-flowering crop cultivars to bracket advanced bee emergence predicted by GDD ensemble models.  
  
### 6.4 Chemical Stewardship  
• Defer sulfoxaflor and other systemic applications in warm autumns; integrate with overwintering risk forecasts.  
• For honey bees, time varroa treatments before late-brood surge in warm winters.  
  
### 6.5 Decision-Support Tools  
• Embed ALMaSS or LandscapePhenoBee modules into farmer dashboards (API-linked to ERA5 climate now-casts).  
• IoT micro-loggers (±0.1 °C) inside hives/nests can trigger alerts when respiration threshold likely to be crossed.

## 7  Research Gaps & Forward-Looking Ideas  
1. **Microclimate Mapping:** Develop 10-cm-scale soil temperature layers using UAV thermal imagery to capture actual overwintering niches.  
2. **Diapause Genomics:** CRISPR screening of insulin-TOR, clock, and metabolic genes across taxa to quantify adaptive potential (flagged as speculative).  
3. **Compound Stress Experiments:** Fully factorial designs combining temperature, pesticides, drought, and nutrition.  
4. **Socio-economic Feedbacks:** Agent-based models coupling beekeeper decision rules with climate outcomes (speculative).  
5. **Cryo-banking:** off-site cryopreservation of genetically diverse bees as a hedge against extreme winters (speculative).

## 8  Recommendations  
1. Immediately integrate overwinter degree-day accumulation metrics into regional pollinator risk assessments.  
2. Fund field validation of ALMaSS-*Osmia* and LandscapePhenoBee under EURO-CORDEX RCP 4.5 & 8.5 scenarios.  
3. Encourage plant breeders to align cultivar phenology with advanced bee emergence.  
4. Launch cross-agency pesticide × temperature synergism testing protocols.  
5. Establish an open micro-climate sensor network for overwintering habitats.

## 9  Conclusion  
Climate change is already reshaping the overwintering landscape for bees—not merely by shifting calendar dates but by altering the energetic calculus that underpins survival and fitness.  The evidence base, anchored by fine-scale physiological work on *Osmia* and bolstered by new agent-based models, reveals clear mechanisms and actionable levers.  Rapid deployment of micro-climate management, adaptive breeding, and integrated modelling can buffer pollination systems, but proactive cross-disciplinary coordination is essential.
