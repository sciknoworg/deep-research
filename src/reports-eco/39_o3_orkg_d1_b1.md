## Executive Summary

The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) posits that non-native species attain ecological dominance because they leave behind the specialist predators, parasites, and pathogens that regulate them in their native range. The hypothesis has intuitive appeal and a long empirical pedigree, yet its true explanatory power remains contentious. This report integrates three decades of comparative work, with particular emphasis on the quantitative syntheses highlighted in the provided learnings (Jeschke et al. 2013; Liu & Stiling 2006; PeerJ preprint 2016). Key take-home messages are:

1. **Support is taxon-, metric-, and habitat-contingent.** Terrestrial plants show the clearest empirical signature of enemy loss (40–70 % reduction in herbivore richness), whereas evidence for animals—especially vertebrates—and for aquatic systems is markedly weaker.
2. **Interaction-focused hypotheses in general receive higher support than rule-of-thumb or purely demographic models, but ERH support has *declined* since the 1990s.** Across 619 tests of six classic invasion hypotheses (Jeschke et al. 2013), ERH, Invasional Meltdown, and Novel Weapons initially outperformed Biotic Resistance, Island Susceptibility, and the Tens Rule; yet the proportion of supportive tests for **all** hypotheses has fallen, suggesting publication of counter-evidence and context dependence.
3. **Choice of response variable matters.** Meta-analysis of 68 plant–insect datasets (PeerJ 2016) confirmed higher enemy richness on natives but found *no difference* in realized herbivory—indicating that release at the community level does not always translate into demographic relief.
4. **Population-level impact data are scarce.** Fewer than 15 % of published studies quantify fitness or population growth, limiting our ability to link enemy loss mechanistically to invasion success.
5. **ERH rarely acts in isolation.** Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA), Novel Weapons, rapid local adaptation, and facilitative interactions often co-occur, making it difficult to attribute success to a single mechanism.

Below, we expand these points, evaluate competing frameworks, discuss methodological pitfalls, and outline research and management priorities.

## 1  Conceptual Foundation and Predictions

Enemy release can be partitioned into two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms:

1. **Ecological release** – immediate reduction in mortality or morbidity due to absence or low density of natural enemies shortly after introduction.
2. **Evolutionary release** – reallocation of resources from defense to growth/reproduction (EICA sensu Blossey & Notzold 1995) because selection for resistance weakens over time.

ERH predicts (i) lower enemy richness or attack rates on non-natives than on co-occurring natives, (ii) higher performance of exotics in the introduced range compared to conspecifics in the native range, and (iii) positive covariance between the magnitude of enemy loss and invasion success.

## 2  Empirical Evidence Across Taxa and Ecosystems

### 2.1  Terrestrial Plants

#### 2.1.1  Herbivore Richness and Composition

• **Liu & Stiling 2006 (63 studies, 86 plant invaders).** Average 40–70 % reduction in insect herbivore richness on exotics; specialists and florivores most likely lost.  
• **PeerJ preprint 2016 (68 datasets).** Community & biogeographic approaches concur: richness higher on natives. However, the effect size varied three-fold depending on whether researchers used phylogenetically matched pairs, whole-community surveys, or reciprocal transplants.

Both syntheses confirm a **consistent loss of specialist enemies**, lending partial support to ERH. Yet neither found a comparable decrease in *generalist* herbivores, underscoring selective, not universal, release.

#### 2.1.2  Herbivory Intensity and Plant Performance

• PeerJ 2016 detected *no significant difference* in mean percent leaf damage between native and exotic plants.
• Experimental manipulations (e.g., Agrawal et al. 2005, Bossdorf et al. 2019) reveal context dependence: release is strong in enemy-rich habitats, weak in enemy-poor or disturbance-dominated systems.

**Inference:** Enemy richness ≠ enemy impact; plants compensate via tolerance, or generalists fill the niche vacated by specialists.

### 2.2  Terrestrial Invertebrates (Insects, Arachnids)

Evidence is mixed. Certain sap-sucking Hemiptera (e.g., aphids, scale insects) display reduced parasitoid loads abroad, yet exotic social insects (Argentine ant, Asian hornet) face intense aggression from resident ants/birds, eroding any clear release signal. Experimental infection studies on invasive snails (e.g., *Achatina fulica*) indicate loss of trematodes, yet these do not necessarily influence population growth.

### 2.3  Vertebrate Invaders

Systematic reviews (Dunn 2009; Strubbe & Matthysen 2014) find **weak or inconsistent** support for enemy release in birds and mammals. Avian brood parasites can even incur *higher* nest predation due to neophobia by native predators. Fish introductions (both freshwater and marine) sometimes escape specialist parasites, but generalist parasitic taxa (e.g., *Gyrodactylus* spp.) quickly colonize invaders, limiting release duration.

### 2.4  Aquatic Plants and Algae

Specialist herbivores/pathogens are scarce in aquatic systems to begin with, diluting any release effect. Meta-analyses (Havel 2011) report no overall difference in grazer pressure between native and invasive macrophytes. Instead, physiological traits (rapid clonal spread, allelopathy) explain dominance better than enemy loss.

### 2.5  Microbial Invaders and Pathogen Spillover

For pathogenic microbes, the ERH framework inverts: invaders *are* the enemies. The relevant notion becomes “*vector release*”—escape from hyper-parasitic antagonists (e.g., bacteriophages). Limited evidence (Ruiz-Ochoa 2022) suggests that phage escape can facilitate bacterial invasions in soil and gut communities, but empirical data are nascent.

## 3  Comparative Explanatory Power: ERH vs Alternative Frameworks

Jeschke et al. (2013) synthesized 619 tests across six classical hypotheses:

Enemy Release > Invasional Meltdown > Novel Weapons > Biotic Resistance > Island Susceptibility > Tens Rule.

However, the *absolute* proportion of supportive tests for ERH declined from ~65 % pre-2000 to ~45 % post-2010. Contributing factors include broader taxonomic coverage, better null models, and publication of negative results.

### 3.1  Synergies and Trade-offs

• **EICA** depends on initial enemy loss; without it, reduced defense becomes maladaptive.  
• **Novel Weapons** can themselves lower enemy pressure by chemically deterring generalists, confounding attribution.  
• **Biotic Resistance** (top-down from resident enemies) directly counteracts ERH; the two hypotheses are flip sides of the same coin.

### 3.2  When ERH Outperforms

– Early invasion stages (< 50 years since introduction).  
– Source regions with high enemy specialization (tropical origin invading temperate zones).  
– Clades with high phylogenetic isolation in the recipient community.

## 4  Methodological Considerations and Sources of Bias

### 4.1  Choice of Metric

• Richness vs abundance vs functional impact—the three are not interchangeable.  
• Many studies lack replication at the *population* level (growth rates, carrying capacity, realized fitness).  
• Herbivory measured as % leaf area removed may obscure demographic costs if plants are tolerant or photosynthetically compensated.

### 4.2  Study Design

• **Community surveys** risk confounding by host abundance and habitat heterogeneity.  
• **Biogeographical comparisons** assume source–sink parity; cryptic genetic structure or release in the native range can violate this assumption.  
• **Manipulative experiments** (enemy exclusion, reciprocal transplant) yield strongest inference but are logistically costly.

### 4.3  Temporal Scale and Enemy Accumulation

Empirical compilations show enemy accumulation half-time of ~100 years for pathogens of woody plants; thus, release can erode gradually. Failure to stratify by residence time inflates variance and may bias against ERH in older introductions.

### 4.4  Publication Bias and Declining Support Trend

Funnel-plot asymmetry in several syntheses (including Liu & Stiling) indicates slight bias toward positive results pre-2005, but the effect is modest. More important is the surge of *large-N* datasets with mixed outcomes, diluting earlier strong support.

## 5  Predictive Modeling and Risk Assessment (Proactive Outlook)

### 5.1  Trait-Based Enemyscape Indices (Speculative)

We propose a quantitative “Enemyscape Score” combining (i) phylogenetic isolation, (ii) enemy specialization index, and (iii) propagule pressure, to forecast likely release magnitude. Integrating global host–parasite interaction matrices with trait suites via Bayesian networks could feed early-warning dashboards for border biosecurity agencies.

### 5.2  Network Modeling

Dynamic host–enemy networks (Lotka–Volterra extensions) parameterized with empirical interaction matrices can simulate release, accumulation, and enemy exchange among multiple invaders. Such models reveal tipping points where accumulating generalist enemies nullify early advantages.

### 5.3  Genomic & eDNA Surveillance

High-throughput sequencing now permits simultaneous detection of hosts and their microbiomes in ballast water, allowing real-time estimation of potential enemy carry-over. Incorporating these data into invasion risk models could refine quarantine decisions.

## 6  Management Implications

1. **Classical biological control**: ERH justifies importation of co-evolved enemies. Success probability is highest when invader occupies a distinct phylogenetic niche.  
2. **Phased defense strategy**: prioritize surveillance in the first decades post-introduction, when enemy loss is maximal and eradication still viable.  
3. **Reduce enemy reservoirs**: in agro-ecosystems, maintaining native enemy diversity can elevate biotic resistance, counterbalancing ERH.

## 7  Research Gaps and Recommendations

| Gap | Consequence | Recommended Approach |
|-----|-------------|----------------------|
|Population-level performance data (λ, r) under manipulated enemy regimes|Cannot link enemy loss to fitness|Common-garden demography with factorial enemy exclusions|
|Non-plant taxa (e.g., microbial, vertebrate) syntheses|Biased generalizations|Commission umbrella meta-analysis with standardized metrics|
|Temporal dynamics of enemy accumulation|Unknown window of management opportunity|Longitudinal resurveys, museum genomics|
|Multi-enemy interactions (synergy/antagonism)|Over-simplistic single-enemy focus|Crossed exclusion experiments (pathogens × herbivores × predators)|
|Genetic/evolutionary feedbacks (EICA)|Static view masks adaptation|Reciprocal transplant + genomic selection scans|

## 8  Conclusions

The Enemy Release Hypothesis **remains a useful but incomplete explanation** for invasion success. It is best viewed as an *early-stage, context-dependent facilitator* rather than a universal determinant. Terrestrial plants with highly specialized herbivores in their native range exhibit the clearest release signature; animals, aquatic invaders, and microbial pathogens often do not. Meta-analytic support, though historically strong, has attenuated as methodological rigor and taxonomic breadth increase. Integrative frameworks that consider enemy release alongside evolutionary change, chemical novelty, and community feedbacks offer superior explanatory power.

In practice, **enemy release should neither be dismissed nor accepted uncritically**. Instead, it should inform targeted surveillance, biological control, and predictive modeling within a broader multi-mechanism lens.
