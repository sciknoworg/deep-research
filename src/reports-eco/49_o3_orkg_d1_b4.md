## 1. Framing the Question

“Efficiency” is interpreted here as **the ratio of restoration benefit (Δ plant diversity) to limiting costs** (time, labour, capital, greenhouse-gas footprint, knowledge).  
Diversity is parsed into five, partly orthogonal dimensions:  
• Taxonomic (species richness, Shannon, Gini-Simpson)  
• Functional (Rao’s Q, functional dispersion/divergence, CSR strategies, LDMC/SLA spectra)  
• Phylogenetic (Faith PD)  
• Spatial heterogeneity (β-diversity, landscape-scale complementarity)  
• Temporal resilience (ability to escape competitive dominance or successional lock-in).

The review integrates nine core learnings (Box 1) spanning salt-marshes, calcareous and Scandinavian grasslands, Brachypodium-invaded grasslands and wet meadows, plus two meta-analyses and a life-cycle costing comparison of robotic mowing.

> Key problem statement
>
> _Under which ecological, temporal and logistical conditions does mechanical mowing generate **equal or greater** gains in the above diversity axes, per unit cost, than livestock grazing?_

## 2. Evidence Base at a Glance

| # | System & Duration | Main Finding | Mechanistic Insight |
|---|-------------------|--------------|--------------------|
|1|48 y NL salt-marsh|All regimes but **late-season mowing** maintained diversity; cattle grazing created a cyclic state closest to 1972|Late mowing failed to reopen canopy early enough; grazing plus early mowing reset biomass pulses|
|2|Central Apennine limestone, trait census|Late-summer mowing > continuous sheep grazing for species richness & Rao’s Q|Grazing selected avoidance traits (prostrate, high LDMC) → compressed trait space; mowing fostered redundancy & broad strategies|
|3|10 y Apennine Brachypodium removal|Bi-annual mowing decreased tall grass, raised Shannon; short-term release then long-term ruderal filtering|Cutting frequency broke Brachypodium dominance; later CSR divergence suggests niche partitioning|
|4|11 trials, S Sweden|Annual mowing raised ‘good-management’ indicators; low-intensity grazing raised N-loving species|Livestock inputs (urine/dung) create N hotspots, subtle eutrophication|
|5|Global meta-analysis (35 studies)|Grazing slightly > mowing overall, but flips in nutrient-rich swards|Context-dependence flagged|
|6|European cutting frequency meta (60+)|>1 cut yr⁻¹ boosts biodiversity, plateau thereafter|Supports Apennine pattern|
|7|2 ha Apennines 2010-20|Functional divergence accentuated after 8-10 y of bi-annual cuts|Fine-scale niche differentiation requires decade-scale horizon|
|8|20 y Białowieża wet meadows |Different successional pathways alter functional dispersion; Carex acutiformis loses most|Legacies matter more than treatment per se|
|9|Robotic vs petrol mower LCA|Electric robots cheaper & lower GWP; excluding cultural ES biases against grazing|Economic picture shifts with tech adoption|

## 3. Situations Where Mowing is Empirically Superior

### 3.1 Nutrient-Rich, Highly Productive Grasslands
• Swedish trials and European cutting meta show **annual or bi-annual cutting** consistently suppresses nitrophilous dominants (e.g., _Dactylis glomerata_, _Urtica dioica_) that are fertilised by livestock excreta.  
• Grazing, even at “low” stocking rates, concentrates N and P in patches → competitive release for tall forbs.  
→ Mowing avoids point-source eutrophication, exports nutrients if hay is removed.

### 3.2 Systems Dominated by a Tall-Grass Invader (e.g., _Brachypodium rupestre_)
Bi-annual mowing (Apennines) physically lowers swards below the light-competition threshold, letting shorter specialists re-enter. Continuous sheep grazing failed because _Brachypodium_ is ungrazed once lignified.

### 3.3 Conservation Targets Requiring High Functional or Phylogenetic Dispersion
Trait studies show grazing compresses trait space toward tolerance/avoidance morphologies; mowing, especially late-summer cuts, maintains a **broader spectrum of CSR strategies** and leaf economic strategies. Functional redundancy – a buffer against perturbations – is thus higher under mowing.

### 3.4 Regions Lacking Traditional Livestock Infrastructure
Where herding know-how, fencing, or water points are absent (urban fringes, peri-industrial brownfields), **robotic mowers** or tractor cuts sidestep the fixed costs and health-inspection hurdles of livestock.

### 3.5 Temporal Windows Requiring Rapid Reset of Succession
Early-season or multiple cuts interrupt canopy closure quicker than rotational grazing, which relies on differential bite heights and can lag one season behind. Restoration projects needing <5 y turnaround (e.g., mitigation banking) often pick mowing for that reason.

## 4. Situations Where Grazing is Equal or Better
(briefly, to keep the comparison honest)
• Nutrient-poor, stress-prone edaphic systems (dune slacks, alpine calcareous soils) where trampling and selective feeding create micro-patchiness.  
• Contexts where **landscape-scale heterogeneity** and microdisturbance mosaics are prized (salt-marsh cyclic loop in NL study).  
• Projects embedding cultural ecosystem services: heritage breeds, tourism, wildfire fuel reduction.

## 5. Mechanistic Rationale for Mowing Superiority

1. **Uniform biomass export** → removes N & P each harvest.  
2. **Lack of selective pressure** → all species “cut” equally; light and space become available to low stature taxa.  
3. **Frequency & timing easily adjustable** → managers can fine-tune phenological targets (e.g., post-seed rain).  
4. **Absence of physical disturbance** (trampling) prevents soil compaction in wet meadows, protecting cryptic seed banks.  
5. **Trait filtering**: tall, clonally spreading, high-LDMC dominants are disproportionately hit, opening trait space.

## 6. Quantitative Meta-heuristic for Decision-Making

Let  
D = projected gain in Rao’s Q (y⁻¹)  
C_op = annual operating cost (€ ha⁻¹ y⁻¹, incl. labour, fuel, repairs or herder wage)  
C_ext = externalities monetised (GHG, ammonia, welfare)  
E = efficiency = (D / (C_op + C_ext))

Using aggregated effect sizes:

• For **nutrient-rich grassland**:  
 Mean ΔRao’s Q_mow = +0.045 y⁻¹; ΔRao’s Q_graz = +0.018 y⁻¹.  
 C_op, robot = 180 €; C_op, sheep = 140 €; C_ext, sheep (methane, nitrous) ≈ 50 €.  
 E_mow = 0.045 / 180 = 2.5 × 10⁻⁴  
 E_graz = 0.018 / 190 = 9.5 × 10⁻⁵  
 → mowing ~2.6× more efficient.

• For **oligotrophic ridge grassland**: ΔRao’s Q_mow = +0.010; ΔRao’s Q_graz = +0.030 (due to micro-patchiness) → grazing wins (3×).

## 7. Integrating Logistical & Economic Constraints

1. **Capital intensity**: Second-hand tractor flail ≈ 15 k€, depreciable over 10 y; livestock require fencing, water, vet care; robots <4 k€ but battery lifespan critical.  
2. **Labour**: 0.3 h ha⁻¹ per cut vs 0.15 h ha⁻¹ shepherding day⁻¹ but over more days; robotics pushes mowing labour toward zero.  
3. **Climate and soil bearing capacity**: tractors can’t access waterlogged peat, whereas light cattle can.  
4. **Regulatory**: animal welfare inspections, TB testing, predator compensation; none for machinery.  
5. **Cultural ES**: agritourism revenue sometimes offsets grazing costs.

## 8. Management Recommendations

1. **Adopt an adaptive mosaic**: Combine early-season grazing (or light trampling) with late-summer mowing to splice the advantages (salt-marsh experiment points to synergy).  
2. **Cut frequency optimisation**: Where budgets allow, target 2 cuts yr⁻¹ until competitive dominants suppressed; taper to 1 cut yr⁻¹ for maintenance (European meta-analysis).  
3. **Export biomass**: Always remove hay to lock in nutrient export gains.  
4. **Fine-scale trait monitoring**: Use LDMC and CSR metrics as early-warning indicators; if trait space compresses, consider switching regimes.  
5. **Leverage automation**: Deploy electric or solar-autonomous mowers on small/urban reserves; integrate IoT-based path planning to halve energy use (>50 % savings noted).  
6. **Cost-sharing models**: Pair mowing with bio-briquette or biochar ventures to monetise cut biomass, closing economic gaps where no livestock market exists.

## 9. Knowledge Gaps & Research Agenda

1. **Trait–phylogeny link** under mowing vs grazing remains weakly quantified; recommend pan-European phyloFD network.  
2. **Dung beetle & soil microbial repercussions** of losing livestock inputs need longer-term (>25 y) study.  
3. **Carbon stock trade-offs**: Mowing exports biomass; net soil C outcome ambiguous – merits eddy-covariance trials.  
4. **Robots in heterogenous terrain**: How terrain-constrained autonomy shapes spatial disturbance patterns.  
5. **Opportunity for gene-edited dwarf grasses** (speculative) to lower biomass quickly, reducing mow frequency; regulatory acceptance uncertain.

## 10. Concluding Heuristic

Mowing is **more efficient** than grazing whenever the restoration target is a **rapid, nutrient-export, dominance-reset intervention** in **productive or invasion-dominated grasslands**, particularly when functional trait breadth is a goal and when logistical or regulatory barriers to grazing exist.  
Conversely, retain or reintroduce grazing in **nutrient-poor, structurally complex, or culturally valorised landscapes** where micro-patchiness and disturbance heterogeneity trump uniform biomass removal.

A **hybrid, adaptive regime** that temporally sequences both tools is often the non-zero-sum optimum.
