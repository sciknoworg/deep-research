# Management Extensification and Grassland Plant Diversity – A Global Synthesis

## 1. Executive Summary

Management *extensification*—shifting from high‐input, high‐disturbance grassland use toward lower external inputs and/or lower stocking or mowing pressure—almost universally increases **vascular‐plant species richness** provided that (i) some biomass removal persists to prevent litter build-up, and (ii) grazing or cutting intensity is **kept in the light-to-moderate window** rather than being eliminated entirely. Across 54 mostly temperate European studies, conversion of abandoned or intensively used grassland to *extensive* management produced a very large mean richness gain (Hedge’s g = 1.78, Schneider 2024). In contrast, escalation from moderate to heavy stocking cuts richness by ≈15–25 % globally (Herrero-Jáuregui & Oesterheld 2017), with the steepest losses in arid, inherently low-productivity systems. Trials in China and South Africa confirm that **light rotational grazing** can match or exceed total exclusion for both biodiversity and soil-carbon outcomes, whereas heavy continuous grazing simultaneously erodes species richness, above-ground biomass and SOC. 

Key quantitative insights:

* Moderate cattle grazing in a semi-arid meadow steppe raised plant species richness by 9 % in just four years while leaving total biomass unchanged; an iso-intensity mowing regime failed to boost richness and depressed biomass (NE China 6 ha experiment).
* Grazing thresholds are well-defined in some systems: Inner Mongolia steppe switched from net SOC accumulation and diversity gains to losses above **≈4.5 sheep ha⁻¹** (June–Sept). Any heavier pressure (~7.5 sheep ha⁻¹) halved plant biomass and reduced richness.
* Adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) / high-density, short-duration rotational grazing raises SOC 17–50 % within a decade in North America and South Africa, while either maintaining or increasing botanical richness relative to both continuous grazing and full exclusion.
* Long-term exclusion can overshoot: 21 yr fencing maximised particulate C and forb abundance in Inner Mongolia, but 34 yr exclusion allowed litter to accumulate, shading out short-lived species and causing diversity and SOC to decline (Dong et al. 2020). 

Hence, the optimal extensification pathway is **not total abandonment** but a *low‐input, low-frequency disturbance regime* that recycles nutrients, prevents litter smothering and avoids chronic soil disturbance or nutrient addition.

## 2. Scope, Definitions and Conceptual Model

### 2.1 Definition of “Management Extensification”

For this synthesis we treat extensification as any transition from a higher-input or higher-disturbance regime toward a more benign one, including:

1. **Stocking-rate reduction** (from heavy or moderate continuous grazing to light rotational grazing or seasonal grazing).
2. **Switch from mowing/haylage multiple cuts → single annual hay cut**, or from silage to hay.
3. **Fertiliser and pesticide withdrawal** on improved pastures.
4. **Cropland reversion to permanent pasture** without ongoing cultivation.
5. **Abandonment/exclosure** (no grazing or mowing) – considered the *extreme* of extensification.

### 2.2 Target Variable

Main response: **vascular-plant alpha-diversity** (plot-scale species richness 0.25–10 m²). Complementary metrics (functional group composition, beta diversity, soil biota and SOC) are invoked where informative.

### 2.3 Pathways Linking Extensification to Diversity

1. **Soil resource availability**: withdrawing fertiliser lowers soil N and P, favouring slow-growing stress-tolerant forbs and legumes.
2. **Disturbance frequency/intensity**: low-intensity grazing or a single hay cut prevents competitive exclusion by tall grasses while avoiding severe defoliation or trampling.
3. **Litter accumulation**: some biomass removal is essential; otherwise shading and anoxia at the soil surface suppress seedling establishment.
4. **Soil-carbon feedbacks**: rising SOC under light rotational grazing improves moisture retention and cation exchange, supporting richer forb assemblages in semi-arid zones.
5. **Herbivore selectivity**: large herbivores create microsites (patchy grazing, dunging) that elevate beta diversity.

## 3. Evidence Base and Synthesis

### 3.1 Meta-analytical Signals

| Category | Richness response | Key reference(s) |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Conversion to *extensive* management (low-input grazing or annual hay) | +1.78 SD (≈ +60–80 % mean species richness) | Schneider 2024 (54 European studies) |
| Heavy → moderate or light grazing | −15-25 % richness when *pressure increases*, negligible gains when pressure is merely eased below moderate | Herrero-Jáuregui & Oesterheld 2017; China rotational trials |
| Grazing cessation (exclosure) vs. light rotational | Mixed; short-term richness often ↑, long-term (>20 yr) can decline due to litter | Dong et al. 2020; Abdalla et al. 2022 |

### 3.2 Grazing-Intensity Gradient

**Heavy continuous grazing** (stocking densities beyond ecosystem-specific thresholds) exerts triple stress: biomass removal + trampling + nutrient hot-spots. Meta-analyses across China (Hao et al. 2024) and globally (Li et al. 2024) demonstrate concomitant soil-carbon losses (−7.5 % SOC; suppressed soil respiration) and above-ground biomass depletion that usually translate to **lower plant richness and convergence toward grazing-tolerant grasses**.

**Light to moderate rotational grazing** maintains disturbance without chronic stress. Four-year meadow steppe trial: species richness +9 %, biomass stable. SOC gains of 59–75 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹ under <4.5 sheep ha⁻¹ confirm that plant diversity and carbon sequestration are co-optimised in this window.

**Very light or zero grazing** (exclosures) boost litter. Initially this raises forb and shrub seedling establishment, but after ~20 yr competitive exclusion/shading reverses gains. Inner Mongolia chronosequence: particulate SOC peaked at 21 yr, then declined by 34 yr, mirrored by diversity.

### 3.3 Mowing and Haymaking

When biomass is cut once annually and removed as hay, nutrient export slows eutrophication. European meadow restorations show mowing achieves gains similar to grazing in alpha richness but lacks grazing’s micro-patchiness, so beta diversity tends to be lower. The NE China trial illustrates potential pitfalls: iso-intensity mowing reduced biomass 18 % and did *not* raise species count, implying that in semi-arid systems mowing alone may overshoot disturbance.

### 3.4 Fertiliser / Pesticide Withdrawal

Although not dissected in the meta-analyses above, cessation of NPK inputs is a prerequisite for the biodiversity response in nearly all European agri-environment schemes (AES). Long-term experimental stations (e.g., UK Park Grass) show that withdrawing N fertiliser can double forb richness within 5–10 yr provided cutting/grazing is retained.

### 3.5 Cropland Reversion to Pasture

Meta-evidence focused on SOC (Henry et al. 2024; Phukubye et al. 2022) shows strong carbon gains when arable fields are reseeded to permanent pasture. Botanical data indicate colonisation by stress-tolerant ruderal forbs and legumes within 3–5 yr, followed by a slow rise in specialist grassland species (>15 yr), particularly if grazing is reintroduced lightly.

### 3.6 Climate and Edaphic Modifiers

* **Arid & semi-arid**: Benefits of low-to-moderate grazing are largest; heavy stocking most damaging. Grazer exclusion only raises SOC/diversity where rainfall <400 mm yr⁻¹ and AHM > 45.
* **Moist-cool temperate**: Any grazing reduced SOC by 19 % (Abdalla et al. 2018) and often depresses diversity; here a *single annual hay cut* may be superior.
* **Kastanozem & meadow steppe soils**: Soil type is secondary to grazing intensity for SOC/dynamics (Hao et al. 2024) but heavier clay content buffers trampling damage, allowing slightly higher safe stocking.

---

## 4. Temporal Dynamics

**Short-term (1–5 yr)**
* Rapid colonisation of ruderal forbs once fertiliser input stops.
* Detectable richness gains after two grazing seasons under light rotational regimes.

**Medium term (5–15 yr)**
* Increasing functional diversity; legumes stabilize N supply; SOC accrual in particulate + mineral‐associated fractions.
* Richness continues to rise if disturbance remains moderate, plateaus if abandoned.

**Long term (>20 yr)**
* Litter accumulation becomes limiting under exclosure.
* AMP grazing maintains heterogeneity, keeps richness high, and shifts carbon into mineral-associated pools (Stanley et al. 2025; Khatri-Chhetri et al. 2024).

## 5. Mechanistic Integration with Soil Carbon and Ecosystem Function

The carbon literature (Phukubye 2022; Henry 2024; Hao 2024) clarifies that *the same intensification pressures that simplify plant communities also deplete SOC* via removal of photosynthate biomass and root turnover. Conversely, AMP grazing enhances fungal dominance, reduces soil CO₂ efflux (−17 %), and channels C into stable mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM). Plant-diversity gains under light rotational regimes are therefore **co-benefits**, not trade-offs.

---

## 6. Management Implications and Recommendations

1. **Keep Some Disturbance**: Aim for *light-to-moderate, short-duration grazing* or a single annual hay cut; avoid both total abandonment and continuous heavy grazing.
2. **Use Adaptive Multi-Paddock (AMP) Where Feasible**: 24 paired Alberta ranches and 1,440 cores across California show +17–32 % SOC and maintained/increased richness. Rest periods (30–90 days) are key.
3. **Calibrate Stocking Thresholds Locally**: As a heuristic, stay ≤ 4 – 5 sheep ha⁻¹ (or cattle equivalent) during the main growing season on semi-arid steppe; in mesic tall-grass systems even lower pressure (~0.5 LSU ha⁻¹) may suffice.
4. **Avoid Nitrogen Fertiliser on Target Biodiversity Areas**: Withdraw NPK completely; accept lower herbage yield.
5. **Monitor Litter and Species Composition** annually; if litter exceeds 400–500 g m⁻², introduce a defoliation event.
6. **Exploit Heterogeneity**: Create micro-mosaic via variable stocking density, patchy fencing, or mechanical scrapes to boost beta diversity.
7. **Integrate Remote Sensing & eDNA** (speculative)—Drone-based multispectral mapping and soil eDNA metabarcoding could provide near-real-time feedback on biodiversity outcomes.

## 7. Knowledge Gaps and Future Directions

* **Quantitative trade-offs between mowing vs. rotational grazing** in moist-cool climates remain unresolved—call for factorial trials controlling for nutrient export.
* **Functional and phylogenetic diversity** responses lag behind taxonomic metrics; future work should integrate trait-based approaches.
* **Extreme climate variability** (hot droughts) may shift optimal grazing windows; long-term experiments need climate-loop scenarios.
* **Socio-economic barriers** to AMP adoption (labour, fencing costs) warrant investigation alongside biodiversity metrics.

## 8. Concluding Remarks

Extensification—when implemented as low-input grazing or annual hay cutting—consistently enhances grassland plant diversity while reinforcing soil-carbon sequestration and ecosystem resilience. The global evidence base now delineates clear **intensity thresholds** and highlights **rotational grazing** as a scalable solution that reconciles production with conservation. Total abandonment is *not* the silver bullet; rather, *managed heterogeneity* at light stocking or cutting levels secures the highest biodiversity dividends.
