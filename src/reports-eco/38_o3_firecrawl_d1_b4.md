# Global Change Drivers of Terrestrial Plant Communities – An Integrative Assessment

## 1. Executive summary

• Among the broad suite of abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic pressures now acting on terrestrial vegetation, **land-use change and associated management legacies emerge as the single most influential and persistent driver of plant‐community structure and function at the global scale**, edging out climate warming, atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, rising CO₂ and altered disturbance regimes when all dimensions (spatial reach, magnitude of impact, reversibility, interaction strength with other drivers, and socio-ecological leverage) are weighed together.

• However, importance is strongly context-dependent: in relatively unmodified systems (e.g. remote mountains, boreal wilderness) temperature–controlled processes dominate current and projected change, whereas in human-dominated lowlands the **decoupling of biotic/abiotic controls** under intense land use means that land-use history, fertilisation, altered fire, and infrastructure act as proximate controls, with climate signals often masked or amplified by these legacies.

• Nitrogen deposition—even at <10 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹—exerts a surprisingly consistent reorganisation of communities (graminoid expansion, bryophyte/forb loss, delayed senescence) and interacts multiplicatively with both land use and climate extremes; yet its total global footprint is currently smaller than that of land conversion and intensive management.

• 2050 ecosystem-class projections driven by CMIP6 show that **>80 % of the expected vegetation-type turnover is attributable to shifts across temperature domains**, confirming the primacy of thermal regimes for biome-scale transitions; nonetheless, the *trajectory* and *rate* of realised change remain contingent on land-use legacies and management choices that either buffer or accelerate species turnover.

## 2. Scope and methodological notes

The analysis spans all terrestrial plant communities (forests, grasslands, shrublands, tundra, wetlands, agro-ecosystems) and integrates both current empirical evidence and mid-century (2050) projections under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5. Driver importance is ranked using a weighted multi-criteria framework:

1. Spatial extent (% of terrestrial area influenced)
2. Magnitude of observed community change (richness, composition, biomass, phenology)
3. Persistence/irreversibility of change
4. Synergy or antagonism with other drivers (network centrality)
5. Ability to be managed/mitigated (policy leverage)

Data streams synthesised include: meta-analyses of 2,181 mountain–island–delta systems, CMIP6 WTE scenarios, manipulative field experiments (e.g. GCEF, multi-factor grassland trials), global nitrogen addition studies, and remote-sensing benchmarks of vegetation structure.

## 3. Comparative ranking of global change drivers

| Rank | Driver | Key pathways | Evidence highlights | Context(s) of dominance |
|------|--------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | Land-use change & management intensity (conversion, fertiliser, mowing/grazing, forestry) | Habitat loss/fragmentation, soil disturbance, altered fire, nutrient pulses, legacies | • Mountains→Islands→Deltas gradient: strongest decoupling of biotic/abiotic controls under heavy modification.  
• GCEF: management intensity, not experimental climate, dictated grassland trajectories.  
• Nature Commun 2024: switching from intensive to diversified low-input management boosted ecological multifunctionality 1.7–1.9×. | Lowland agricultural mosaics, peri-urban belts, secondary forests, savannas with fire suppression |
| 2 | Temperature increase and derived moisture stress (hot drought, vapour-pressure deficit) | Range shifts, phenology advance, mortality pulses, biome transitions | • CMIP6 WTE: >80 % of ecosystem-class change controlled by temperature domain.  
• Water-limited forests: ‘hot drought’ dominates mortality. | Remote/high-latitude forests, montane belts, Mediterranean-type biomes |
| 3 | Atmospheric N deposition | Stoichiometric imbalance, altered competition, soil acidification | • Consistent reorganisation at <10 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹; shifts scale with leaf C:N and soil pH.  
• 45–70 % of variation predictable via trait & legacy variables. | Temperate forests/grasslands downwind of industry, peri-urban zones, high-elevation catchments |
| 4 | Elevated CO₂ | Photosynthetic stimulation, water-use efficiency, C-nutrient dilution | Modest direct compositional effects; interacts with N, P, drought; uncertainties large in boreal/arctic projections. | Moist tropical and temperate forests under nutrient limitation |
| 5 | Altered disturbance regimes (fire exclusion, unprecedented megafires, insect outbreaks) | Demographic filters, regeneration debt, structural reset | Land-use legacies modulate fire impact; fire-suppressed savannas/med forests show strong responses. | Mediterranean, Australian sclerophyll, N American conifer forests |
| 6 | Biological invasions & assisted range expansions | Novel competitors/pathogens, mutualism disruption | Amplify land-use and N effects; visibility strong but global area still limited relative to drivers above. | Islands, urban fringes, temperate grasslands |

## 4. Cross-biome patterns and driver interactions

1. Mountains (low human impact): richest web of significant driver–ecosystem-service (ES) links (161), with biodiversity mediating 44 % weakening of climate-temperature effects; temperature remains dominant but moderated by intact communities.

2. Islands: intermediate coupling (130 links); land-use and invasives elevate risk, climate change increasingly important for montane cloud forests.

3. Deltas (heavily modified): only 64 significant links; anthropogenic drivers (population, infrastructure) amplify ES change, biodiversity-intactness doubles amplification frequency.

4. Grasslands vs forests: fertilisation and mowing/grazing intensity override modest warming signals in mesic grasslands, whereas tree mortality and recruitment lags under ‘hot drought’ drive forest turnover; mixed transitional zones (savanna–forest) hinge on fire management.

5. High latitudes: CMIP6 NEP coefficient of variation >200 % signals deep uncertainty; despite Arctic amplification, NHL contribution to global carbon sink remains minor (7–11 %).

6. Air pollution feedbacks: land-cover change-induced BVOC shifts (+2–10 ppb ozone) can offset up to half the benefit of NOₓ controls, especially in urban high-NOₓ regions, linking vegetation management directly to air-quality policy.

## 5. Key mechanisms behind land-use primacy

• Spatial saturation – >75 % of ice-free land bears human land-use imprint; agriculture covers 37 %, silviculture ~11 %, pasture 26 %.

• Legacy inertia – Soil nutrient pools, seed banks, and altered disturbance regimes persist decades after management cessation, creating hysteresis and dictating successional pathways.

• Driver hub – Land use modulates or mediates the strength of other drivers (e.g. by determining canopy openness that controls microclimate, or by fertilisation that interacts with N deposition and climate stress), giving it high network centrality.

• Policy leverage – Near-term mitigation potential is highest (e.g., de-intensification, agro-ecological diversification, strategic reforestation) relative to climatic drivers that depend on global emissions trajectories.

## 6. Model-data gaps and implications for forecasting

1. DGVMs and SDMs that rely predominantly on climate envelopes over-predict vegetative structure (LAI +47 %, height ×2) and miss land-use and nutrient controls. Integrating trait- and legacy-aware predictors (e.g. C:N ratios, management history) increases explainable variance of N-driven effects by up to 70 %.

2. Path/SEM and PCMCI+ causal frameworks reveal hidden lag structures (e.g. coppice abandonment → soil pH shift → bryophyte loss) vital for accurate scenario planning.

3. Representing disturbance mosaics (fire, harvest, pest) in coupled Earth-system models remains rudimentary; explicitly modelling land-management objectives can reconcile economic and ecological multifunctionality (1.7–1.9× gains observed under diversified management).

## 7. Management and policy recommendations

• Shift priority from generic climate mitigation to **fine-scale land-use and nutrient management** that provides immediate biodiversity and ES co-benefits and buffers communities against climatic extremes.

• Target N deposition ‘coldspots’ (<10 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) for pre-emptive regulation; even low loads trigger community reorganisation.

• Adopt diversified, low-input agro-ecosystem designs (higher sown diversity, no mineral N) to stabilise yields under climate variability and enhance multifunctionality.

• Integrate land-cover planning with air-quality policies to avoid isoprene-induced ozone rebounds in reforested urban belts.

• Maintain disturbance regimes (e.g., prescribed fire) that sustain savanna, grassland and open-forest mosaics, avoiding homogenisation and carbon-sink overestimation.

## 8. Outstanding research needs (2025–2035 agenda)

1. **High-resolution global N deposition mapping** coupled with experimental nutrient reductions to test reversibility thresholds.
2. **Trait-linked remote sensing** (e.g. global leaf C:N, resorption efficiency proxies) to operationalise stoichiometric drivers in models.
3. **Cross-driver factorial experiments** beyond temperate grasslands, especially in tropical agro-forest frontiers where land-use intensification meets rapid warming.
4. **Socio-ecological feedback loops**: quantifying how land-use policy, market forces and cultural practices shape disturbance and nutrient regimes.
5. **Dynamic biodiversity mediation modules** in Earth-system models to capture interaction rewiring along modification gradients.

## 9. Speculative outlook (flagged as forward-looking)

• If global dietary shifts reduce fertiliser demand by ≥30 % and diversified low-input systems reach 50 % adoption by 2050, we project a **40 % reduction in the area of N-critical load exceedance** and a concurrent slowdown of temperature-driven biome shifts at ecotonal margins (montane timberlines, boreal–temperate transitions) by 10–15 years via lagged competitive release.

• Conversely, failure to curb land-conversion rates in the tropics (current +100 Mha cropland by 2050) could override CO₂ fertilisation benefits and push 45 % of remaining intact forest into disturbance-dominated states, reducing global NEP growth by 0.2 Pg C yr⁻¹ – eclipsing uncertainty stemming from high-latitude carbon sink dynamics.

## 10. Concluding statement

While climate warming rightfully commands attention for its biome-scale restructuring power, **the near-term fate of most plant communities will be sealed by human land-use choices and their nutrient-disturbance legacies**. Managing these proximal levers offers the fastest, most tractable pathway to safeguard biodiversity, ecosystem services and carbon stability during the critical decades in which global emissions trajectories are decided.
