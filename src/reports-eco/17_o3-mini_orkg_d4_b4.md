# Final Report: The Effects of Climate Change on Bee Overwintering Periods

## 1. Introduction

Climate change is a multifaceted driver that exerts both direct and indirect influences on bee populations through alterations in temperature, precipitation, and seasonal cues. Overwintering—the period when bees remain dormant or in a reduced metabolic state—is critical to their survival and reproductive success. Recent integrative studies have revealed that both genetic and phenotypic responses modulate bees’ ability to withstand climatic extremes during this period. In this report, we review a broad spectrum of research findings ranging from genomic adaptations and life-history trait plasticity to ecological and urban planning interventions. Our aim is to elucidate the complexities of overwintering dynamics in bees, focusing on differences among bee species and overwintering stages (adult versus prepupal), regional considerations, and the role of both direct climatic shifts and indirect ecological impacts such as altered forage availability.

## 2. Mechanisms Underpinning Overwintering Responses

### 2.1. Genetic and Physiological Adaptations

Population and genomic studies in bumble bees (e.g., _Bombus huntii_, _Bombus vancouverensis_, and _Bombus vosnesenskii_) emphasize that historical climate instability has driven fluctuations in effective population sizes, thereby underpinning contemporary genetic diversity. Key adaptive responses have been linked to genes involved in neural and neuromuscular functions, ion transport, and cuticle formation. These genetic factors correlate strongly with temperature and precipitation variables, implicating them in thermal and desiccation tolerance during overwintering periods. Notably, genomic studies highlight that temperature-induced expression of neural/ion transport genes influences emergence timing and voltinism; such molecular findings are crucial for understanding how bees physiologically adjust to warming climates.

### 2.2. Life-History Traits and Phenological Plasticity

Research shows that life-history traits—including voltinism, emergence timing, and the overwintering stage—play a decisive role in moderating bees’ responses to warming. Studies have compared solitary bees overwintering as adults versus as prepupae, with results showing that adult overwinterers tend to experience reductions in body size, lifespan, and increased risk of early-season phenological mismatches, whereas prepupal bees exhibit more pronounced shifts in emergence dates with implications for competitive interactions and resource use. Furthermore, even species-specific differences (e.g. between honey bees and bumble bees) are observable when rising spring temperatures drive earlier brood rearing and foraging onset. The quantitative linkage between a 1°C warming and an approximate 6.5-day advancement in emergence (as documented in British wild bee studies) confirms that temperature directly modulates overwintering cues, though photoperiod remains a modulating signal.

## 3. Direct Climatic and Indirect Ecological Impacts

### 3.1. Direct Climatic Changes

The direct impacts of climate change are evident in the alterations of temperature profiles during overwintering. Elevated ambient temperatures lead to advanced emergence, a phenomenon captured through experiments that report shifts as high as 13.4 to 24.9 days under various Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Around 20% of winter mortality in species like _Apis mellifera_ is linked to episodic extreme cold spells. Moreover, differential thermal environments—such as those observed in aboveground versus underground nests in bumble bees—create additional challenges. For example, warmer ambient conditions may extend foraging periods but simultaneously impose unsustainable cooling requirements and thermal regulation challenges that exacerbate overwinter mortality.

### 3.2. Indirect Ecological Effects

Indirect climatic effects include the alteration of forage availability and shifts in plant-pollinator synchrony. Overwintering bees emerging earlier may face reduced floral resources if plant phenology does not keep pace. Multi-trophic experimental studies, such as those involving early-spring flowering plants like _Pulsatilla vulgaris_ and pollinators like _Osmia cornuta_, highlight clear mismatches: temperature increases can enhance plant flowering and bee emergence at different rates. Urban gradients further complicate this picture. Detailed studies in regions such as Toledo (Ohio) and SE Portland (Oregon) underscore that variations in urban microclimates—often influenced by impervious cover and floral resource density—can be managed via urban ecological planning, offering an indirect mitigation strategy for managing phenological mismatches.

## 4. Modeling Advances and Predictive Frameworks

### 4.1. Integrative Modeling Approaches

Recent advances in integrative modeling, such as the LandscapePhenoBee model, have combined temperature-dependent colony dynamics, spatial heterogeneity, and within-season foraging behavior to forecast responses to extreme climatic events—including droughts that affect bumble bee populations. Recurrent neural network models (LSTM and GRU architectures) are increasingly used for predicting hive weight dynamics and linking overwintering physiological metrics to subsequent colony performance. These models are vital for disentangling the interplay between direct temperature effects and altered ecological interactions such as forage distribution and pollination networks.

### 4.2. Species Distribution and Urban Planning

Dynamic Species Distribution Models (SDMs) using algorithms like MaxEnt, GLM, GAM, and Random Forest have forecasted significant range shifts for bee species. For instance, under RCP 8.5 scenarios, models predict that species such as _Ceratina australensis_ will expand into coastal and urbanized areas. Similarly, Brazilian bee species like _Melipona bicolor_ and _M. scutellaris_ show severe habitat reductions in ecologically sensitive regions such as the Atlantic Moist Forest. These findings point to the need for proactive, spatially explicit urban planning strategies that incorporate SDM outcomes to buffer against climate-induced losses in climatically suitable habitats.

## 5. Differential Vulnerability Based on Overwintering Strategy

### 5.1. Adult vs. Prepupal Overwintering

Empirical evidence robustly indicates that the life stage during which bees overwinter is a critical determinant of their sensitivity to climate change. Controlled experiments reveal that adult overwinterers exhibit more drastic reductions in body mass and longevity, likely due to heightened metabolic demands when confronted with warmer winter conditions. Contrastingly, prepupal bees tend to advance their emergence without as dramatic a penalty on body condition, although they are not free from risks such as increased exposure to mid-summer resource scarcity. These stage-specific responses require nuanced management and conservation strategies that tailor interventions—like the timing of habitat enhancements—to the overwintering stage of target species.

### 5.2. Phenological Mismatches and Fitness Trade-offs

Advances in phenological timing (e.g., a shift of 6.5 days earlier per 1°C warming) underscore the potential for mismatches between bee emergence and plant flowering. Such mismatches can significantly reduce individual fitness due to inadequate resource acquisition post-emergence. Research in regions as diverse as the UK and Central Virginia demonstrates that these mismatches not only threaten individual survival but may also cascade to affect pollinator-plant networks and ultimately ecosystem services like crop pollination. The interplay between individual body condition, genetic predisposition, and stage-specific overwintering strategies compounds these challenges, particularly for species with restricted geographic ranges and those associated with specialized habitats.

## 6. Management Strategies and Future Directions

### 6.1. Habitat Restoration and Assisted Migration

Integrated management strategies that promote floral landscape enrichment have been shown to elevate key physiological markers such as vitellogenin levels and improve overwintering success in species like _Apis mellifera_. The development of tailored habitat restoration projects, including the selective planting of early and late-blooming species, can help buffer against phenological mismatches. Assisted migration is another proactive strategy that may offer relief, especially for species facing severe habitat contractions under future climate scenarios.

### 6.2. Urban Ecological Design and Green Infrastructure

Urban environments offer both challenges and opportunities. Studies demonstrate that thoughtful urban planning—such as the incorporation of green corridors, apiaries, and pollinator parks—can mitigate the adverse effects of urban heat islands and foster regions with moderated microclimates. Innovations like the ‘Urban Beeing’ concept showcase how post-industrial landscapes can be retrofitted to support diverse bee communities, thereby enhancing ecosystem resilience in the face of ongoing climate change.

### 6.3. Refinement of Predictive Models and Experimental Designs

Looking ahead, the integration of high-frequency multivariate data (e.g., hive weight, temperature, humidity) with advanced forecasting models – including LSTM and GRU architectures – holds promise for more accurately predicting the impacts of climate change on bee overwintering. Further, factorial experimental designs that manipulate both temperature and photoperiod will be crucial in disentangling the contributions of direct thermal stress versus indirect ecological drivers. Such designs are essential for targeted interventions that aim to re-synchronize plant-pollinator interactions at both local and regional scales.

## 7. Conclusions

Climate change dramatically influences the overwintering periods of bees, with effects that are mediated by genetic diversity, life-history traits, and local environmental conditions. The differential responses between adult and prepupal overwinterers underscore the importance of life stage-specific physiological adaptations in determining fitness and survival under warming conditions. Moreover, the complex interplay between direct climatic shifts (e.g., temperature increases) and indirect ecological impacts (e.g., phenological mismatches with flowering plants) necessitates a multifaceted approach to conservation and urban planning. Advanced integrative models, targeted habitat restoration, and adaptive management strategies provide a robust framework for mitigating these impacts. Continued research—leveraging both experimental and modeling advances—will be critical in formulating strategies that preserve pollination networks and secure the ecosystem services bees deliver in a rapidly warming world.
