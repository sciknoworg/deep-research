# Final Report: Monitoring and Managing Snow Goose Populations While Preserving Food Security for Arctic Indigenous Communities

## Overview

This report synthesizes a wide range of interdisciplinary research findings related to the understanding, monitoring, and management of snow goose populations in Arctic regions. In doing so, it underscores the critical intersection of advanced remote sensing technologies, machine learning algorithms, and the integrative use of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) from Indigenous communities. The primary goal is to provide a multi-scale, stakeholder-driven framework that not only tracks migratory dynamics but also aligns with the food security imperatives of Arctic Indigenous peoples.

## 1. Integrated Monitoring Framework: Technologies and Methodologies

### 1.1 Multi-Scale Remote Sensing and Geospatial Techniques 

Recent advances in remote sensing have enabled the integration of drone-based photogrammetry, satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2, VENµS, ResourceSat-2), and GPS telemetry to capture spatio-temporal patterns across large Arctic landscapes. This multi-scale approach provides robust empirical insights into both migratory patterns and critical seasonal phenomena such as snow cover dynamics and snowmelt progression. For instance:

- **Satellite Remote Sensing & Drones:** High-resolution imagery obtained via drones and satellites has been effectively combined with hyperspectral vegetation indices. Such indices are not only useful for forage quality estimation in high northern latitudes but also correlate with ecological indicators like snow cover dynamics and bird behavior.
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning:** Applications of machine learning—especially advanced deep learning architectures such as U-Net—have shown superior performance in processing multispectral datasets. In particular, a U-Net classifier using Sentinel-2’s bands (B2, B11, B4, and B9) has demonstrated markedly improved accuracy over conventional random forest classifiers and rule-based methods (e.g., Sen2Cor) in mapping snow coverage. This enhanced spatial and spectral resolution directly supports the spatially-targeted management of snow geese populations.

### 1.2 Combining Remote Sensing with Ecological and Subsistence Indicators

The coupling of remote sensing data with on-ground ecological observations is crucial. Hyperspectral vegetation indices, for example, allow researchers to estimate forage quality—a critical factor for both wildlife habitats and Indigenous subsistence practices. By tracking snow dynamics with precision, researchers can correlate the seasonal availability of forage with the spatial behavior of migratory species, such as snow geese and pink-footed geese. Drone evidence in Svalbard has already demonstrated the precise delineation of up to 15 tundra ground cover classes, linking habitat disturbance rates to specific levels of vegetation change (e.g., 23.4% in moss tundra, 11.2% in dwarf-shrub heath).

## 2. Integration of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Stakeholder Engagement

### 2.1 The Role of Indigenous Communities in Data Co-Production

Integrating TEK with advanced geospatial tools is exemplified by initiatives like the EALAT project. Indigenous communities across Arctic regions, including those in Nunavut and other regions with rich subsistence cultures, provide localized observations that are critical for contextualizing remote sensing data. For example, local stakeholders contribute nuanced data about seasonal changes, local migratory routes, and culturally significant subsistence practices. This collaboration ensures that the data collection process remains culturally grounded and results in adaptive management frameworks that are both resilient and locally relevant.

### 2.2 Stakeholder-Driven Analysis and Conflict Resolution

Network analyses and structured decision frameworks have identified a gap between information-driven outcomes (e.g., early detection of ecological changes) and process-driven outcomes (e.g., community cooperation and knowledge exchange). These analyses not only emphasize the need for expanded stakeholder networks but also highlight the necessity of mitigating conflicts between conservation strategies and immediate food security needs. Specifically:

- **Co-Design Initiatives:** Projects in Nunavut and Svalbard have fostered a cooperative environment involving indigenous representatives, scientists, and policy makers. In these projects, co-designed data collection protocols enable the integration of technologically driven metrics with local TEK.
- **Conflict Resolution Mechanisms:** Balancing immediate food security with long-term ecological stability requires carefully constructed frameworks for conflict resolution. Structured decision frameworks have been employed to prioritize the dual objectives, ensuring that ecological monitoring does not compromise the nutritional and cultural needs of indigenous communities.

## 3. Strategic Recommendations for Long-Term Management

### 3.1 Balancing Immediate and Long-Term Objectives

The management strategies must navigate the tension between immediate food security solutions and long-term ecological balance. Short-term strategies might include the use of real-time remote sensing data to predict and manage sudden ecological shifts that could jeopardize food supplies. Meanwhile, long-term strategies should focus on sustainable habitat management, adaptive monitoring techniques, and continued integration of TEK with scientific research. 

Some recommended actions include:

- **Establishing Continuous Monitoring Networks:** Deploy integrated systems combining drone imagery, satellite data, and GPS telemetry to enable real-time monitoring of snow cover and goose migration patterns. Timely data will inform immediate responses to potential food security threats.
- **Adaptive Management Frameworks:** Develop frameworks that can be iteratively revised, based on ongoing data inputs from both remote sensing and participatory monitoring. This framework should prioritize rapid adaptation strategies while setting pathways for long-term ecological stewardship.
- **Collaborative Policy Frameworks:** Form policies that emphasize shared decision-making. Institutionalize stakeholder committees that include community leaders, local specialists, and scientists to ensure the co-production of knowledge and conflict resolution.

### 3.2 Leveraging New and Emerging Technologies

The rapidly evolving landscape of remote sensing and machine learning offers multiple avenues for improved monitoring of snow goose populations:

- **Hyperspectral and Multispectral Advances:** Emerging hyperspectral sensors offer finer spectral resolutions, enabling a more granular analysis of ecological indicators such as vegetation health, snowmelt patterns, and habitat changes.
- **Drones and Real-Time Data Platforms:** The deployment of drones with advanced imaging capabilities can significantly reduce the lag between data collection and decision-making. Real-time data transmission facilitates immediate responses to changes in migratory behavior and environmental conditions.
- **Integration of Wearable and IoT Devices:** Although primarily used in human health sectors, innovative applications of wearable technology and IoT devices might be adapted for wildlife tracking. These could include lightweight sensors that monitor physiological parameters of birds, offering insights into stress levels or migratory adjustments due to ecological shifts.

### 3.3 Expanding Interdisciplinary Research and Collaborative Networks

Another key recommendation is to bolster interdisciplinary research networks that bring together experts in remote sensing, machine learning, indigenous studies, and ecological management. Specifically:

- **Transdisciplinary Collaboration:** Foster partnerships between universities, indigenous communities, governmental organizations, and non-governmental agencies to ensure that monitoring strategies are holistic, culturally sensitive, and scientifically robust.
- **Pilot Projects and Field Trials:** Initiate pilot projects that implement these integrative strategies across diverse Arctic regions. These trials should focus on testing the scalability of deep learning frameworks, participatory monitoring techniques, and conflict-resolution models in real-life scenarios.
- **Feedback Loops and Continuous Learning:** Establish feedback loops that allow lessons learned from initial project phases to inform subsequent monitoring phases. This will also facilitate adaptive management practices and ensure that the methods remain responsive to both ecological and cultural shifts.

## 4. Conclusion

This report identifies the critical need for a multi-faceted approach in monitoring and managing snow goose populations while safeguarding the food security of Arctic Indigenous communities. Leveraging a combination of advanced remote sensing techniques, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, and deep integration of Traditional Ecological Knowledge creates a robust framework for addressing the dual challenges of ecosystem sustainability and food security. 

The recommended strategies suggest a synthesis between high-resolution environmental monitoring and the culturally grounded participatory methods—ensuring that both immediate needs and long-term resilience are balanced effectively. By embracing a multi-stakeholder, multi-scale, and adaptive management regime, policymakers and indigenous communities alike can forge a path that honors tradition while embracing innovation.
