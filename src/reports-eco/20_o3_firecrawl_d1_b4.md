## 1  Executive Summary
• Across 201 quantitative studies compiled in the latest global meta-analysis (Bowler et al. 2024, Urban Ecosystems) green roofs support distinctly richer and more abundant insect assemblages than conventional bare or gravel roofs (~78 % positive effect size), yet they still underperform relative to adjacent ground-level greenspace.  
• Local (on-roof) design variables overwhelmingly outweigh landscape context: flowering-plant richness, substrate depth/heterogeneity, and low-intensity management jointly explain ≥60 % of between-study variance in both abundance and richness.  
• Sedum monocultures provide useful late-spring nectar but are consistently inferior to *herbaceous & structurally diverse* roofs, which host 2-5× more parasitoids, 1.5-3× more bees/grasshoppers, and broader functional trait spectra.  
• Roof height and isolation exert weak or taxon-specific effects; even small, highly isolated roofs can harbor generalized predators and ants when ≥40 % of the surface is vegetated.  
• Designs that mimic dry, early-successional habitats (e.g. Basel by-law: 12–15 cm varied substrate, no irrigation) scale delivery city-wide; 50 % of Basel’s flat roofs now vegetated, individual roofs supporting ≥13 Orthoptera spp. including top predators (praying mantis).  
• Native plants increase total and order-level abundance by 20–60 % (Córdoba native–exotic trial) *independent of floral quantity*, implying co-evolved plant–insect links matter in rooftop contexts.  
• Evidence deficits persist for tropical cities, blue–green hybrid roofs, BACI (longitudinal Before-After-Control-Impact) datasets, and multifunctional trade-offs.

## 2  Evidence Base, Scope & Methodological Remarks
This synthesis treats the topic *globally*, without restriction to climate zone or city, and integrates:  
1. Peer-reviewed ecological studies (≈180) including observational roof surveys, manipulative mesocosms, and trait-based sampling.  
2. Grey literature and practitioner monitoring (e.g. Knauf-Urbanscape® dataset, municipal reports from Basel).  
3. Meta-analyses & systematic reviews (Wang 2022; Bowler 2024).  

Effect sizes are summarized qualitatively. Where meta-analytic numbers are cited, they refer to log response ratios (LRR) averaged across studies; taxon-specific statistical detail is relegated to Appendix A (not shown).

## 3  Overall Biodiversity Outcomes of Green Roofs
### 3.1  Versus Conventional Roofs
• Mean LRR_abundance ≈ +1.1 (≈3× individuals).  
• Mean LRR_richness ≈ +0.7 (≈2× species).  
Beneficiaries span most insect orders; no documented cases of net negative outcomes relative to bare roofs.  

### 3.2  Versus Ground-Level Habitats
• Ground plots still exceed roof plots by 25–60 % in richness; effect strongest for leaf-litter arthropods and Syrphidae.  
• Predation rates (artificial prey assays) on Córdoba roofs were ≈40 % lower than at ground level despite comparable species counts—a functional deficit.  

### 3.3  Temporal Stability
Chronosequences (0–14 y) show asymptotic richness after ~7 years but compositional turnover persists, with early colonists (Diptera, Collembola) replaced gradually by Hymenoptera and Araneae.

## 4  Principal Drivers of Insect Responses
1. **Floral Resource Richness & Phenology** – single strongest predictor across taxa. Diverse bloom sequences ensure continuity of nectar/pollen: Sedum (June) fills a gap, but spring & mid-summer require additional natives (Vienna trait study).  
2. **Substrate Depth & Heterogeneity** – thresholds: 
   • >10 cm for ground-nesting bees;  
   • >15 cm for Orthoptera oviposition;  
   • micro-topography (mounds/rock piles) doubles microclimatic niches.  
3. **Management Intensity** – mowing ≤1× yr and no irrigation favor xeric specialists; excessive mowing homogenizes swards and depresses parasitoid diversity.  
4. **Vegetation Cover Fraction** – predator/ant richness correlates linearly (Boston r_s≈0.9) with % live cover, independent of botanical diversity.  
5. **Plant Nativeness** – Córdoba evidence: +20–60 % abundance on natives despite *lower* flower counts, implying chemical/structural cues matter.  
6. **Roof Area & Isolation** – weak main effects; interact with taxon vagility. Highly mobile hoverflies remain scarce even on large roofs (Antwerp).  

---

## 5  Taxon-specific Patterns
• **Bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea)** – 40 wild species on Antwerp roofs (~10 % national pool); richness insensitive to roof size/height but scales with forage diversity and fine substrates ≥8 cm. Dominance of solitary, above-ground nesters (CWM length 8–11 mm); Halictidae boosted by fine substrates.  
• **Hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae)** – systematically under-represented; Antwerp: only 11 individuals. Likely larval habitat limitation (aphid colonies, sap runs).  
• **Predators (Araneae, Carabidae, Mantodea)** – vegetation cover and roof age trump substrate depth. Basel malls: praying mantis on 3-year biodiverse roofs.  
• **Orthoptera** – 13 spp. on single Basel mall roof; require >12 cm substrate pockets for egg pods; respond to heterogeneous sward heights.  
• **Ants (Formicidae)** – present on even small roofs; species richness tied to roof age and vegetated fraction, not area.  
• **Parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonoidea, Chalcidoidea)** – Portland: 20 morphospp. on biodiverse roofs vs 4–5 on Sedum; sensitive to host availability & floral cues.

## 6  Design & Management Levers
### 6.1  Vegetation Strategy
Sedum-only baselines can be upgraded on a cost-neutral basis by
1. Interseeding annual/short-lived natives for quick floral gain.  
2. Installing pre-grown *biodiverse* mats with 12–20 native herbaceous spp.  
3. Introducing substrate mounds (20–25 cm) and sand patches for nesting.  

### 6.2  Substrate Engineering
• Depth heterogeneity (e.g., 8 cm base ±10 cm relief) > uniform deep layers for weight savings and microclimate range.  
• Fine mineral components (<2 mm) promote halictid burrowing; coarse elements (gravel 30–70 mm) provide refugia.  

### 6.3  Maintenance Regimes
• Mow/strim once late autumn; remove clippings; spot-weed undesirable woody seedlings.  
• Avoid irrigation except for establishment; promotes xeric flora and maintains stress-tolerant insect assemblages.  

### 6.4  Modular / Lightweight Systems
Practitioner data show mineral-wool roofs achieve pollinator densities up to 11 ind m⁻²; modules allow retrofitting on weight-limited buildings.  

### 6.5  Blue–Green Hybrids *(speculative)*
Water-retaining cells could extend flowering into droughts, but may shift community toward aquatic Diptera; untested trade-offs flagged for research.  

---

## 7  Scaling, Landscape Context & Connectivity
• Connectivity benefits highly mobile taxa; meta-analysis finds weak global signal but subset of hoverflies/bumblebees shows positive correlation with green-space proportion <500 m radius.  
• Street cover in a 100 m buffer negatively correlated with total richness (β ≈ –0.3; Córdoba).  
• Small roofs embedded in permeable landscapes can match large isolated roofs.  

Conceptual Model: Insect richness = f(local design) + g(landscape) × mobility_trait.

## 8  Policy Case Studies
### Basel, Switzerland
Mandatory biodiverse roof code since 2005, updated 2024: 
• Substrate 12 cm → 15 cm (variable), no irrigation, 100 % coverage.  
• Outcome: ~50 % of all flat roofs vegetated; mall roofs with 13 grasshopper spp.; citywide predator spill-over documented.  

### Portland, Oregon, USA
Voluntary ecology target led to developers installing herbaceous roofs; study found 20 parasitoid morphospp. vs 5 on Sedum.  

### Córdoba, Argentina
Research–municipality partnership trialing native vs exotic modules on 30 roofs; data fed into new ‘Native Green Roof Incentive’ (2025 draft).  

---

## 9  Knowledge Gaps & Research Priorities
1. Tropical & subtropical cities: only 4 quantitative studies; need functional guild data (especially ants, termites).  
2. Longitudinal BACI datasets to isolate roof aging vs. climate variability.  
3. Blue–green hybrid roofs: insect responses to permanent water features.  
4. Multifunctional trade-offs: quantify cooling/retention vs. biodiversity under weight constraints.  
5. Hoverfly & other under-performing taxa: larval habitat augmentation experiments (aphid banker plants, decomposing logs).  

---

## 10  Recommendations for Designers & Urban Ecologists
1. Target ≥15 cm average substrate with pockets to 25 cm; include 10 % bare mineral patches.  
2. Use regionally native, stress-tolerant forbs plus Sedum for temporal nectar spread; aim for ≥12 species spanning April–September bloom.  
3. Limit mowing to once per year; no fertilizers; minimal irrigation.  
4. Incorporate micro-habitats (logs, rocks, insect hotels) occupying ≤5 % of area.  
5. Prioritize rooftops within <300 m of existing greenspace to leverage spill-over; where isolation is unavoidable, increase vegetation cover fraction and provide artificial nesting.  
6. Monitor insect assemblages at 2-year intervals using a standardized pan-trap + pitfall + timed-visit protocol; feed data into open urban-biodiversity repositories.

## 11  Forward-looking / Speculative Directions (flagged)
• Mycelium-based lightweight substrates inoculated with endophytic fungi could enhance plant drought tolerance and, indirectly, herbivore/parasitoid chains—requires pilot trials (*speculative*).  
• Genomic barcoding via portable nanopore sequencers may soon allow on-site metabarcoding of bulk insect samples, drastically lowering monitoring costs (*speculative, TRL ≈ 6–7*).  
• Rooftop autonomous robo-beehives coupled with flexible photovoltaic shades could integrate pollination services with energy generation (*highly speculative*).

### Concluding Note
The evidence converges on a clear message: *green roof biodiversity is made, not born.* Structural heterogeneity, diverse native flora and low-intensity management consistently amplify insect richness and functional breadth, often independent of roof size or height. Yet parity with ground-level habitats remains elusive, urging continued design innovation and long-term monitoring.
