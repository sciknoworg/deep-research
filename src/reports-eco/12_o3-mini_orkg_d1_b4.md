# Final Report on the Impact of Buckthorn Invasion on Biodiversity

This report integrates multiple research learnings that examine both the direct and indirect impacts of buckthorn invasion—specifically European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) and glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus)—on biodiversity. The synthesis collates advanced ecological modeling, field experiments, and integrated management case studies across different geographic regions within North America, offering a detailed picture of buckthorn’s effects on native ecosystems and the challenges in managing this invasive species.

## 1. Introduction

Buckthorn species, initially introduced for ornamental and landscape purposes in the mid-1800s, have become pervasive invasive species in temperate forests, prairies, and savannahs. Their invasion is associated with significant modifications in community structure, native species richness, and ecosystem processes. This report details the multifaceted impacts of buckthorn invasion on biodiversity and provides an extensive review of direct and indirect ecological effects, management responses, and potential innovative strategies to mitigate these impacts.

## 2. Direct Impacts on Native Biodiversity

### 2.1 Reduction in Native Plant Species Richness and Altered Community Structure

Buckthorn invasion has been widely documented to **directly reduce native plant species richness**. Studies have shown a consistent decline in native flora when buckthorn is present. For example, research across diverse plots indicates that buckthorn presence leads to a marked decrease in contextual native plant functional traits such as plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), and chlorophyll content. In southeastern Québec, removal of glossy buckthorn resulted in an increase in the relative growth rates of key understory species like _Asarum canadense_ and _Polygonatum pubescens_ by 48% and 33%, respectively, highlighting the competitive suppression exerted by buckthorn.

### 2.2 Altered Ecosystem Structure and Trophic Interactions

Buckthorn’s impact is not confined solely to plant communities:

- **Shift in Multi-Trophic Interactions:** Investigations reveal that intact native community plots often support increased abundance of bees, leaf-litter beetles, and other pollinators or detritivores compared to buckthorn-dominated areas. In contrast, buckthorn-dense areas sometimes favor organisms such as mouse populations—altering the delicate balance of multi-trophic food webs.
- **Changes in Plant Functional Traits:** Buckthorn invasion has been shown to shift native plant traits toward taller, thinner leaves with reduced chlorophyll content. Such changes may have cascading effects on ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling and energy flow.

## 3. Indirect Impacts and Ecosystem Service Degradation

### 3.1 Alteration of Ecosystem Services

Buckthorn invasion indirectly degrades ecosystem services in several ways:

- **Pollinator Dynamics:** Areas with high buckthorn density exhibit reduced pollinator abundance, likely due to diminished floral diversity and altered microhabitat conditions.
- **Detritivore Decline:** The reduction in detritivores such as leaf-litter beetles impairs decomposition rates and nutrient recycling in forest soils.
- **Food Web Simplification:** In North American woodland ecosystems, studies have observed shorter food webs in invaded areas—demonstrating a less resilient ecosystem structure that can be further compromised by additional stressors.

### 3.2 Landscape-Level and Indirect Biotic Interactions

Advanced ecological modeling, particularly in regions like Wisconsin, has helped tease out landscape-level predictors for buckthorn abundance:

- **Key Predictors:** Variables such as stem density of non-buckthorn woody species, species diversity, diameter at breast height (DBH), proximity to housing, solar irradiation, soil silt content, and even latitude have emerged as significant drivers. These predictors emphasize the role of landscape context in both permitting buckthorn establishment and exacerbating its indirect effects on biodiversity.
- **Ecosystem Engineering:** Buckthorn indirectly facilitates its own spread through interactions with non-native species (e.g., invasive crop pests, European starlings) and soil fauna like _Lumbricus terrestris_, all of which contribute to invasion facilitation dynamics.

## 4. Integrated Management and Restoration Efforts

Management interventions represent a critical component of the research on buckthorn invasion. The learnings illustrate that while mechanical, chemical, and biological management strategies have varied success rates, the timely application and integration of these methods can optimize control measures:

### 4.1 Seasonal and Mechanical Interventions

- **Timely Cutting and Stump Treatment:** Studies in Minnesota have demonstrated that combining cutting with targeted stump treatments using herbicides (notably triclopyr) significantly reduces buckthorn regeneration. The seasonal timing is critical, as spring treatments show reduced seedling densities due to seasonal carbohydrate translocation patterns.
- **Forestry Mowing:** In oak forests in Minnesota, mowing can remove midstory buckthorn but also creates mulch layers that may benefit buckthorn seed banks. This highlights the need for careful post-intervention monitoring to ensure that light availability does not inadvertently promote buckthorn re-establishment.

### 4.2 Non-Chemical Control Alternatives

Innovative, eco-friendly management methods have emerged as promising alternatives:

- **Buckthorn Baggies:** In Wisconsin, Buckthorn Baggies have achieved an 80.7% kill rate, although their efficacy diminishes as stem girth increases. These methods reflect a growing emphasis on non-chemical controls that can be integrated into broader management frameworks.
- **Biocontrol with Fungal Agents:** The application of _Chondrostereum purpureum_ as a biocontrol agent has provided similar stump sprout reduction to that seen with glyphosate. Such biological methods might offer reduced environmental impact and sustainability in long-term management strategies.

### 4.3 Landscape-Scale Modeling for Cost-Effective Strategies

Advanced ecological modeling techniques (e.g., zero-inflated regression, negative binomial regression) have proved invaluable for informing management interventions by identifying key predictors of buckthorn abundance. The integration of genetic studies tracing transatlantic invasion routes enhances our ability to predict future invasion hotspots, allowing managers to allocate resources more cost-effectively.

## 5. Ecological Modeling and Future Research Directions

### 5.1 Advances in Predictive Models

Predictive ecological models in Wisconsin have used binomial and zero‐inflated Poisson/negative binomial regression methods to estimate buckthorn abundance based on landscape-scale variables. These models incorporate:

- Stem density, species diversity, and DBH
- Proximity to housing and solar irradiation
- Soil silt content and latitude

This multi-faceted approach provides critical insights that not only explain current invasion patterns but also forecast future expansion under changing environmental conditions. Future research could further integrate remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms to improve predictive accuracy.

### 5.2 Contrarian and Novel Approaches

Future studies should consider contrarian ideas and emerging technologies:

- **Genomic Tools:** More comprehensive genetic studies could unravel cryptic transmission pathways and potential adaptive shifts in buckthorn populations, providing additional metrics for management strategies.
- **Adaptive Management Frameworks:** Incorporating adaptive management that leverages real-time data collection and ecological feedback loops could optimize intervention timing and methodologies.
- **Interdisciplinary Approaches:** Combining landscape ecology, genomics, and socio-economic analyses can lead to truly integrative solutions that address both the ecological and human dimensions of buckthorn invasion.

## 6. Synthesis and Summary

Overall, the research demonstrates that buckthorn invasion exerts both direct and indirect pressures on biodiversity. Direct effects include the reduction of native plant species richness and shifts in community structure and functional traits. Indirect effects—mediated through altered ecosystem services, simplified food webs, and complex landscape-level interactions—further compound the threat posed by buckthorn to native ecosystems.

Management interventions require a multi-pronged approach tailored to specific ecosystems and seasonal dynamics. Integrated management that combines mechanical, chemical, and non-chemical methods offers promise, as does the use of advanced ecological modeling to inform targeted efforts. The emerging non-chemical alternatives and biocontrol agents present attractive, eco-friendly options that may eventually complement or replace traditional herbicide-based methods.

## 7. Conclusions and Future Considerations

The intersection of buckthorn invasion dynamics with native biodiversity underscores a complex ecological challenge that requires:

1. **Refined Ecological Modeling:** Continued development of predictive models that accurately account for landscape-level variables and seasonal responses.
2. **Adaptive, Integrated Management:** Exploration of innovative non-chemical and biocontrol methodologies alongside traditional management practices.
3. **Comprehensive Ecosystem Monitoring:** Long-term monitoring of multi-trophic interactions to assess both direct and indirect effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Research moving forward should also explore the adaptation of buckthorn populations in response to management interventions and environmental changes. A holistic, interdisciplinary strategy that incorporates these diverse elements is critical for effective mitigation and restoration of invaded ecosystems.

In conclusion, while buckthorn invasion poses a substantial threat to biodiversity, ongoing research provides clear insight into underlying processes and innovative management strategies. By integrating mechanistic ecological insights with advanced modeling and adaptive management, stakeholders can design more effective and sustainable addresses for buckthorn control, ultimately aiming to restore native biodiversity and ecosystem function.
