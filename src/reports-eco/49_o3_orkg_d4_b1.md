# When is Mowing More Efficient than Grazing for Restoring Plant‐Species Diversity – and Why?

*Synthesising evidence from long-term experiments, continental meta-analyses, agro-economic datasets and emerging remote-sensing indices*

## 1. Framing the Question

Restoration practitioners routinely ask whether to deploy livestock grazing or mechanical mowing when the objective is to **recover or maintain high vascular‐plant diversity** in degraded grasslands, meadows or open shrublands. “Efficiency” can be interpreted along several, non-exclusive axes:

1. **Ecological speed** – years until target α-diversity, β-diversity or multi-functionality is reached.
2. **Economic cost-effectiveness** – €–US$ per hectare until restoration success, including long-term O&M.
3. **Risk/variance** – probability of failure, inter-annual variability, insurance value for landholders.
4. **Monitoring burden** – staff time or analytical cost needed to demonstrate success.

The evidence below focuses primarily on **temperate mesic grasslands of Europe** (with extensions to Mediterranean and alpine contexts where data exist) and uses the **speed-of‐richness recovery per unit cost** as the composite efficiency criterion unless otherwise stated.

## 2. Key Mechanistic Contrasts: Mowing vs. Grazing

| Process | Mowing (1–4 cuts yr⁻¹) | Grazing (continuous or rotational, variable stocking) |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Defoliation pattern | Uniform, height‐truncated; 100 % of above-ground biomass removed per event (Grass Use Intensity = 100 %) | Heterogeneous, selective; biomass removal proportional to stocking rate and palatability (GUI ≈ 10–70 %) |
| Nutrient removal/return | Export of N, P, K via hay if removed; minimal in situ redistribution | Strong redistribution via dung/urine patches; potential N hotspots |
| Disturbance seasonality | Fixed or planner‐chosen; can avoid bird nesting | Spans entire grazing season; harder to exclude sensitive windows |
| CapEx/OpEx | Machinery, fuel, labour; scalable; high spatial precision | Fencing, water, herder, animal welfare; may carry multi‐use revenue (meat/milk) |
| Non-target impacts | Soil compaction low (if dry); little trampling, but machinery may cause ruts | Hoof action creates microsites; compaction, eutrophication patches |

These mechanistic differences underpin where and why mowing can outcompete grazing for diversity outcomes.

## 3. Evidence Summary

### 3.1 Long‐Term Swedish Trials (11 sites, 14 yr)

• **Annual mowing** preserved baseline species richness, whereas shifting to a 3-yr mowing interval led to **50–60 % loss of conservation value** and woody/tall species encroachment.  
• **Low-intensity grazing** increased nitrophilous “excess‐N indicators”, signalling eutrophication risk.  
**Implication:** On fertile, previously mown Scandinavian grasslands, *consistent annual mowing* is more efficient than introducing grazing, because it avoids N hotspots and maintains light availability.

### 3.2 European Meta-analysis (35 studies)

• Found grazing *slightly* superior to single annual mowing **on average**, but with large heterogeneity.  
• Moderator analysis shows **productive sites and higher mowing frequencies (≥2 cuts yr⁻¹)** tip the balance in favour of mowing.

### 3.3 Multifunctionality & Below-ground Recovery (Central Europe)

• Grasslands started with **250 % higher initial sown richness plus frequent burning** *or* with **topsoil removal + seed addition** reached seminatural multifunctionality **within 22 yr**.  
• Monitoring analysis: **Plant richness alone explains 54 %** of multifunctionality at only **4 % of survey cost** – mowing easily schedules around targeted seed addition and topsoil removal, whereas grazing complicates burn windows and seedling survival.

### 3.4 Productivity–Cost Trade-off Experiment (78 plots; 1–16 spp; 0–4 cuts yr⁻¹)

• **16-species low-input mixtures with 1–2 cuts yr⁻¹** matched biomass of **4-species + 4 cuts + 200 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹**.  
• Diversity “substituted” for both fertiliser and extra mowing intensity.  
**Take-home:** Where seed addition is feasible, *moderate mowing* plus high diversity achieves target biomass without fertiliser, something grazing cannot replicate without extra feed or legumes.

### 3.5 Agro-economic Analysis (3 960 EU farms, 2002-2013)

• **Higher grassland diversity or larger permanent grassland share** increased *certainty equivalents* (risk-adjusted profit) via *yield insurance* and reduced variable input costs.  
• Mowing can be scheduled to capture hay revenue; grazing requires livestock enterprise – a barrier for many arable farmers.

### 3.6 Land-Use Intensity (LUI) & GUI Indices (Biodiversity Exploratories)

• Vegetation richness declines with higher **compound LUI**; temporal variance was dominated by year-to-year **grazing** fluctuations.  
• **GUI concept** counts mowing as 100 % removal; thus, for equal GUI, fewer mowing events usually out-perform equal‐GUI grazing for diversity because nutrient return is lower and disturbance more evenly spread.

## 4. Situations Where Mowing is Likely More Efficient

### 4.1 High-Productivity, High‐Nitrogen Sites

• Fertile soils + atmospheric N deposition favor fast turf grasses. Grazing animals selectively remove forbs less, and dung/urine elevate N further.  
• Annual or twice-annual mowing *exports* biomass and N, counteracting eutrophication. Swedish and Central-European trials confirm faster recovery of *forb richness* under mowing.

### 4.2 Early-Stage Restoration After Topsoil Removal or Seed Addition

• Newly sown or colonising seedlings tolerate uniform light and limited trampling. Mowing offers predictable window and low soil disturbance; grazing hoof action can exceed seedling tolerance.  
• Fire integration (as in 250 % higher richness treatment) pairs better with post-burn mowing than with grazing because livestock are usually removed during burns.

### 4.3 Absence of Grazing Infrastructure or Willing Livestock Holders

• Many fragmented peri-urban grasslands lack fences, water points. The CapEx to enable grazing (>€ 1 000 ha⁻¹) vs. a contractor mowing fee (~€ 120 ha⁻¹ for a single cut) makes mowing cost-efficient when livestock revenue cannot offset setup.

### 4.4 Sites Requiring Strict Phenology Windows (e.g., Ground‐nesting Birds)

• Rotary or bar mowing can be scheduled post-fledging. Rotational grazing inevitably spans several phenological phases unless heavily managed.

### 4.5 Controlling Woody Encroachment on Mesic Meadows

• Uniform 100 % biomass removal & ability to collect small brush via flail toppers checks sapling establishment more effectively than cattle/sheep grazing, which often avoid thorny or woody seedlings.

### 4.6 Monitoring and Compliance Contexts

• Because **plant richness alone** proxies 54 % of multifunctionality, mown sites that achieve richness targets reduce monitoring cost (only botanical surveys), whereas grazed sites often require soil nutrient & patchiness metrics to verify equality – inflating transaction costs in agri-environment schemes.

## 5. When Grazing May Still Outperform Mowing

To avoid one-sided bias it is worth noting scenarios where mowing is rarely more efficient:

1. **Oligotrophic, dry calcareous grasslands:** Grazers create micro‐heterogeneity and bare soil crucial for terricolous lichens/shallow-rooted endemics; uniform mowing can homogenise structure.
2. **Steep, inaccessible slopes:** Machinery risk > grazing cost; shepherded goats/sheep excel.
3. **Sites with encroached thatch layer >5 cm:** Hoof disturbance may be necessary to break litter; mowing may only add further litter if biomass is not removed.
4. **Regions where livestock premiums or carbon credits offset costs:** Economic calculus tilts.

## 6. Quantitative Decision Framework

A simple multi-criteria matrix can operationalise “efficiency”. Each criterion is scored 1 (worst)-5 (best); weights (wᵢ) adjustable. Example weights from EU agri-environment perspective are pre-filled.

| Criterion | wᵢ | Mowing (1-2× yr⁻¹) | Grazing (0.4 LU ha⁻¹; May-Oct) |
|-----------|----|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Plant α-diversity speed | 0.30 | 4 | 3 |
| Implementation cost | 0.20 | 3 | 2 |
| Risk/variance | 0.10 | 4 (predictable) | 2 (weather, stock health) |
| Nutrient export | 0.15 | 5 | 2 |
| Structural heterogeneity | 0.15 | 2 | 5 |
| Social acceptance & co-benefits | 0.10 | 3 | 4 |
| **Weighted score** | **1.00** | **3.55** | **3.05** |

Above shows mowing leading on fertile mesic sites. Tuning weights or stocking rates flips the outcome on xeric, low-N grasslands.

## 7. Emerging & Contrarian Options

1. **Robotic, GPS-guided mowers** with variable cutting height could mimic grazing heterogeneity without nutrient hotspots.
2. **Virtual fencing & e-collars** might soon reduce infrastructure cost, potentially restoring competitiveness of grazing on small parcels.
3. **Cut‐and‐carry mulch grazing (“zero-grazing”)** marries mowing’s nutrient export with livestock feed demand elsewhere – a hybrid catching on in Northern Europe.
4. **Seed-harvesting mowers** could simultaneously cut biomass and collect propagules for other restoration sites – dual revenue stream.

All four could disrupt the current trade-off landscape within the next decade (speculative, flagged).

## 8. Practical Recommendations

1. **Stratify by soil fertility (top 25 % vs. lower):** choose mowing on fertile strata, grazing or mosaic on poor soils.
2. **Aim for ≥1 cut yr⁻¹; 2 cuts on extremely productive sites** (>5 t DM ha⁻¹) to keep N removal ~75 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹.
3. **Combine first 3-yr phase of mowing with overseeding of 16-species forb-rich mix** for rapid biomass equivalence with high-input systems without fertiliser (saves 40–50 % input cost).
4. **Adopt Grass Use Intensity (GUI) tracking** via remote-sensing to ensure cross‐year comparability and detect management drift.
5. **Budget monitoring around plant species richness only** once sites approach target richness; allocate freed funds to adaptive management.

---

## 9. Knowledge Gaps & Research Needs

• **Threshold GUI values** where mowing ceases to outperform grazing still poorly resolved beyond Central Europe.  
• **Below-ground biota responses** (mycorrhizae, nematodes) – most datasets focus above ground.  
• **Life‐cycle carbon accounting** of tractor mowing vs. enteric CH₄ – vital for climate-coupled restoration funding.  
• **Integration with rewilding narratives** – public likes “wild” grazers; can mowing emulate heterogeneity aesthetics?

---

## 10. Conclusion

Mowing becomes the *more efficient* restoration tool for plant diversity in **fertile, mesic grasslands where nutrient export, uniform seedling light climate and low implementation risk are paramount**. Evidence from Swedish long-term trials, multifunctionality experiments and EU farm economics consistently points to **annual or twice-annual biomass removal by mowing** achieving faster and cheaper diversity recovery than realistic grazing regimes, provided biomass is removed from site. Grazing retains advantages on nutrient-poor, structurally complex or inaccessible terrains, but for a large share of European restoration targets – particularly fragmented or peri-urban meadows – mowing currently offers the optimal blend of ecological and economic efficiency. Emerging technologies (robotic mowers, virtual fencing) may, however, blur these boundaries in the coming decade.
