## 1. Overview and Context

Peary caribou inhabit challenging Arctic landscapes, where seasonal variability in sea-ice dynamics, snow cover, vegetation structure, and low-temperature extremes govern their spatial ecology. The quest to delineate their critical habitat necessitates the use of multi-scale and spatially explicit approaches that combine both quantitative ecological modeling and qualitative assessments from local Indigenous communities. This report builds on a wide range of learnings:

- **Remote Sensing Data:** Key tools such as RADARSAT-1/2 have been used to track sea-ice anomalies from 1983 to 2019, while high-resolution techniques (LiDAR, photogrammetry point cloud fusion) have enhanced capabilities for habitat delineation.
- **Dynamic Snow Modelling:** The SNOWPACK platform provides important insights into the dynamic snow regime that directly affects movement and forage availability.
- **Integrative Traditional Knowledge:** Indigenous knowledge enriches the scientific assessments by providing context-specific insights that are often missed by conventional methodologies.
- **Quantitative Modelling:** Approaches using Resource Selection Functions (RSFs), MaxEnt models, and Bayesian belief networks were essential in understanding caribou-environment interactions and forecasting habitat suitability.
- **Hierarchical Frameworks:** Adopting hierarchical frameworks from woodland caribou studies, which define seasonal ranges, high-use areas, and calving sites, has proven highly adaptable to Peary caribou management.

This multi-dimensional approach, incorporating both spatial technologies and field-based qualitative assessments, helps overcome the challenges posed by the vast and dynamic Arctic environment.

## 2. Methodological Approaches

### 2.1 Remote Sensing and GIS

**a. Satellite and LiDAR-Based Approaches:**

- **RADARSAT-1/2 Contributions:** These platforms have been pivotal in monitoring sea-ice anomalies and providing temporal datasets (1983–2019), which are correlated with habitat accessibility. The sea-ice concentration anomalies serve as critical indicators to understand migratory interruptions, especially in the context of a rapidly changing climate post-2000.
- **High-Resolution Datasets:** The integration of LiDAR and photogrammetry point cloud (PPC) fusion techniques with satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat imagery) enhances the capability to capture fine-scale vegetation structures and terrain undulations. Stand-based image texture analyses further refine the segmentation of caribou habitats.
- **GIS Integration:** Utilizing GIS tools allows for the overlay of multiple environmental layers (digital elevation models, slope, hillshade, NDVI, and phenology metrics) to build robust spatial models. These techniques, when combined with telemetry data, enable researchers to generate risk maps outlining high-use habitat zones, movement corridors, and calving sites.

**b. Dynamic Snow and Climate Modelling:**

- **SNOWPACK Platform:** Dynamic snow models, such as those from SNOWPACK, add another layer of predictive capacity by simulating seasonal snowpack distribution and dynamics. These insights are critical in regions where cumulative dense snow metrics (e.g., CT350 indices) correlate with reduced foraging efficiency and movement disruptions in low-elevation zones.

### 2.2 Field Ecological Methods

**a. Vegetation Surveys and Ground Truthing:**

- Detailed on-ground vegetation surveys complement remote sensing efforts by providing validation data on key vegetation communities, such as forb tundra with lichens, herbs, and dwarf shrubs. Field-based assessments facilitate calibration of GIS models and quantitative predictors derived from image analysis and satellite telemetry.
- **Resource Selection Models:** In the context of Bathurst Island studies, topographic variables including elevation, slope, and hillshade have been integrated into RSFs. These quantitative models are pivotal in assessing detection probabilities, although survey design choices can influence accuracy. Moderate or low coverage designs (achieving 75–96% accuracy) are recommended over intensive ones which may reduce overall detection probabilities in low-density populations.

**b. Integration of Indigenous Traditional Knowledge:**

- Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge provides crucial contextual information regarding seasonal movement patterns and historic baseline conditions. This knowledge often informs areas that may not be apparent from remote sensing datasets alone, particularly in regions where climatic extremities and local microhabitat variations occur.

### 2.3 Quantitative and Spatial Modelling

**a. Statistical and Bayesian Approaches:**

- **Resource Selection Functions (RSFs):** These models have been successfully applied to forecast and spatially validate habitat suitability, incorporating metrics such as anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., roads, pipelines, historical burn areas) in Saskatchewan and British Columbia studies.
- **MaxEnt Models:** These models reveal strong correlations between Peary caribou occurrence and environmental predictors such as terrain elevation, specific vegetation communities, and sea‐ice concentration anomalies. MaxEnt calibrations, enriched by telemetry data and informed by traditional knowledge, can pinpoint critical areas for caribou movement and foraging.
- **Bayesian Belief Networks:** Such networks enable the integration of expert opinions and remote sensing inputs to forecast habitat suitability under various scenarios, including climate-induced environmental changes.

**b. Agent-Based and Scenario Modelling:**

- **Agent-Based Models:** These are particularly useful in simulating individual caribou behavior in response to both natural and anthropogenic influences. Incorporating adaptive behaviors based on immediate environmental feedback, these models simulate migration patterns and habitat utilization over multiple seasons.
- **Hierarchical and Multi-scale Frameworks:** Borrowing concepts from recovery strategies with woodland caribou, hierarchical models subdivide habitat into seasonal ranges, high-use zones, and calving sites. This enables targeted management practices that balance conservation with necessary human development.

## 3. Integrative Framework for Critical Habitat Identification

This section outlines an integrated model that leverages the strengths of each discussed approach for Peary caribou habitat management:

### 3.1 Data Synthesis & Multi-Scale Integration

- **Data Collection:** A coordinated multi-device approach that merges historical satellite data (RADARSAT-1/2) alongside current high-resolution LiDAR and NDVI datasets. This amalgamation helps to generate a comprehensive temporal and spatial picture of key habitat dynamics.
- **Field Surveys and Indigenous Engagement:** Regular on-ground surveys must be coupled with structured engagement with local Indigenous communities. Their insights are integral in refining the spatial models, especially in identifying micro-habitat features and historically significant ecological patterns.
- **Spatially Explicit Modelling:** Combining data layers in a GIS framework facilitates real-time monitoring of habitat changes. Emerging tools such as machine learning-based classification and enhanced texture analysis support dynamic mapping of high-use areas and potential calving sites.

### 3.2 Incorporating Anthropogenic Factors

- **Assessment of Human Disturbance:** Models should explicitly incorporate factors like land use, transportation corridors (roads, pipelines), and industrial activity. For example, quantitative assessments in other caribou populations indicate that a minimal influence of human disturbance (around 3%) may be tolerable, highlighting thresholds for planning and mitigation.
- **Adaptive Management:** Critically, any delineation strategy must account for shifting baselines due to climate change and industrial encroachment. Adaptive management allows conservation strategies to be periodically recalibrated based on updated monitoring data and evolving landscape dynamics.

### 3.3 Predictive and Scenario-Based Analyses

- **Forecasting Habitat Suitability:** Using resource selection algorithms (RSFs, MaxEnt) calibrated with long-term telemetry and field observations, predictive models can simulate how environmental changes (e.g., increasing sea-ice anomalies) affect seasonal habitat utilization in the future.
- **Scenario Testing via Agent-Based Models:** These models allow exploration of various management scenarios, including the potential impact of new industrial developments or extreme climatic events on caribou distribution. Scenario-based analyses support proactive planning, especially in a rapidly warming Arctic.

## 4. Strategic Recommendations and Future Directions

### 4.1 Embrace Multi-Modal Data Acquisition

- **Expand Remote Sensing Capabilities:** Future research should integrate newer satellite platforms and emerging technologies like CubeSats or drone-based remote sensing. This would improve temporal resolution and potentially offer near real-time monitoring of habitat changes.
- **Industry and Climate Mitigation:** As anthropogenic disturbances become more prevalent, regulatory frameworks should aim to minimize disruptions in critical hotspot areas identified by multi-modal assessments. Enhanced regulatory monitoring may be aided by automated GIS alerts when key environmental thresholds are breached.

### 4.2 Strengthen Interdisciplinary Collaborations

- **Cross-Sector Partnerships:** Multidisciplinary collaborations integrating ecologists, remote sensing experts, quantitative modelers, and Indigenous knowledge holders are paramount. Such partnerships will ensure that every critical component—from fine-scale vegetation surveys to expansive climate models—is integrated effectively.
- **Capacity Building:** Investing in local capacity, particularly in remote Arctic communities, to participate in data collection and analysis will boost both the legitimacy and utility of research findings. Incorporating traditional ecological observations into scientifically robust frameworks should be encouraged.

### 4.3 Adaptive Management and Real-Time Adjustments

- **Dynamic Modelling Frameworks:** Implement real-time monitoring systems that update habitat suitability maps as new data are collected. Leveraging cloud computing for rapid data processing and scenario modeling will help decision-makers respond swiftly to environmental changes.
- **Conservation Policy Integration:** Finally, guidelines and regulatory frameworks (exemplified by the drafting of National Recovery Strategies for similar species) should incorporate multi-scale, adaptive management plans that reconcile industrial activities with the preservation of critical habitat for Peary caribou.
