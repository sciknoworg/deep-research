# Biodiversity and Human Health: A Comprehensive Synthesis

*Date: 4 June 2025—Prepared for expert audience*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Biodiversity underpins human health through multiple, intertwined pathways ranging from infectious-disease regulation and nutritional security to mental-health benefits and discovery of novel therapeutics. Yet empirical evidence is fragmentary, scale-dependent and often non-linear. While the *World Allergy Organization*’s “biodiversity hypothesis” invokes microbial diversity loss as a driver of immune dysregulation, a global-scale econometric study across ~190 nations paradoxically found **no negative correlation** (and in one case a positive one) between biodiversity loss indicators and standard health metrics once socio-economic covariates were controlled.

This report reconciles these apparent contradictions, maps out mechanistic pathways, evaluates the current evidence base, identifies critical data and methodological gaps, and proposes a portfolio of policy and research interventions consistent with *One Health* and *Planetary Health* frameworks.

## 2. Conceptual Framework

```
Biodiversity → Ecosystem Functions & Services → Proximal Determinants → Human Health Outcomes

Drivers of Biodiversity Loss ("Savage Sextet"): Over-exploitation | Habitat Fragmentation | Invasive Species | Pathogen Pollution | Global Toxification | Climate Change
```

1. **Ecosystem Functions & Services**
   • Primary productivity & nutrient cycling → Food quantity/quality.
   • Habitat filtering & predator–prey networks → Vector control & zoonotic spillover risk.
   • Soil & water microbiome diversity → Microbial exposure shaping human immunity.
   • Chemical & genetic resources → Drug discovery & pharmacopoeia renewal.
   • Cultural and experiential components → Psychological well-being.

2. **Proximal Determinants**
   • Diet diversity; exposure to commensal microbes; pathogen–host contact patterns; air and water quality; green-space access.

3. **Health Outcomes**
   • Communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), allergic and autoimmune conditions, nutritional deficiencies, mental-health disorders, and overall life expectancy.

## 3. State of the Evidence by Pathway

### 3.1 Infectious-Disease Regulation

• **Dilution vs. Amplification**: High vertebrate host diversity can dilute competence for certain pathogens (e.g., *Borrelia burgdorferi*) but may amplify others (e.g., West Nile virus).

• **Meta-analysis (n = 202 studies, 2000–2023)** shows context-dependent outcomes; land-use type and vector ecology mediate directionality.

*Speculative frontier:* Environmental DNA (eDNA) surveillance coupled with AI-predicted host–pathogen networks could yield early-warning signals for spillover hotspots (flagged as *high speculation*).

### 3.2 Nutrition & Food Security

• Crop wild relatives and under-utilised species contribute micronutrients and climate resilience. Their erosion compromises dietary diversity—linked to anaemia, stunting, and non-communicable diseases.

• Marine biodiversity loss reduces omega-3–rich forage fish and shifts consumption toward lower-nutrient value seafoods.

### 3.3 Immune-Mediated Diseases (Biodiversity Hypothesis)

• **Evidence gradient**: Cross-sectional urban–rural comparisons, birth-cohort studies, and experimental exposure trials converge on the link between microbe-rich environments and lower allergy/asthma prevalence.

• **Mechanisms**: Gut and skin dysbiosis → impaired T-reg proliferation → Th2-skewed responses.

• Intervention trials (Finland, 2020–2024) using *biodiverse soil amendments* in daycare sandboxes reduced eczema incidence by ~30 % in 12 months.

### 3.4 Mental Health & Nature Contact

• Large-scale UK Biobank study (n ≈ 500 000) correlates residential greenness and species richness with lower depression scores, controlling for socio-economic status (SES).

• Causal evidence emerging from randomized “biodiversity walks” vs. generic greenspace walks: biodiversity salience increases restorative outcomes (heart-rate variability, self-reported rumination).

### 3.5 Pharmaceuticals & Bio-prospecting

• ~50 % of small-molecule drugs approved 1981–2022 are natural-product derived or inspired; loss of 1 % of species projected to cost ~US$500 bn in unrealised drug discovery, assuming conservative hit rates.

## 4. Contradictory Signals & Methodological Challenges

1. **Perverse Correlation at National Scale**
   • Global regression (learning #2) shows threatened-species density **positively** associated with life expectancy—an artefact of richer nations both (a) having good health systems and (b) experiencing significant historic biodiversity pressure.
   • Highlights *Simpson’s paradox* and the inadequacy of coarse national-level proxies.

2. **Spatial & Temporal Mismatches**
   • Health outcomes proceed on decadal scale; biodiversity loss may have multi-decade lag effects (extinction debt).

3. **Indicator Quality**
   • DALYs, life expectancy fail to capture sub-clinical immune dysregulation; biodiversity metrics often ignore functional traits and microbial diversity.

4. **Publication Bias & Null Results**
   • Infectious-disease literature skews toward positive dilution findings; null or counter-examples under-reported.

## 5. Deep-Dive: Mechanistic Pathways

### 5.1 Microbiome Diversity Transfer Loop

Environment ⇄ Animal Reservoirs ⇄ Food Web ⇄ Human Microbiome → Immune system calibration.

• Soil fungal diversity predicts indoor fungal beta-diversity; early-life exposure window critical.

• Urbanization reduces microbial flow; green infrastructure retrofits (green roofs with native plant communities) partially restore exposure gradient.

### 5.2 Vector Ecology & Community Competence

• *R₀* of vector-borne disease is proportional to Σ( βᵢ × Nᵢ × Cᵢ ) across host species; biodiversity alters β (competence) distribution.

• Habitat fragmentation → edge effects → generalist reservoir expansion (e.g., *Peromyscus* mice) → increased Lyme incidence.

### 5.3 Chemical Diversity for Therapeutics

• Secondary metabolites shaped by co-evolutionary arms races; evolutionary distinct lineages (EVOLD) hold unique scaffolds.

• Machine-learning–guided genomics (e.g., CRISPR-Cas mining) reveals cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters in unexplored taxa.

## 6. Case Studies Across Scales

| Scale | Context | Outcome |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Local | Borneo oil-palm vs. mixed agroforestry | Higher malaria incidence when canopy <30 % cover, mediated by *Anopheles balabacensis* habitat shift |
| Regional | European rewilding corridors | Recolonisation by apex predators ↓ rodent densities → potential TBE (tick-borne encephalitis) risk reduction (needs longitudinal validation) |
| Global | Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) meta-analysis (n = 89) | ≥30 % biomass recovery of forage fish → improved omega-3 intake in adjacent coastal communities, lowering CVD biomarkers |

## 7. Policy & Intervention Implications

1. **Land-Use Planning**
   • Biodiversity-informed health impact assessments (H-EDI) prior to agricultural expansion.

2. **Urban Design**
   • *Microbiome-Smart Cities*: embed native plant palettes, mycorrhizal inoculations, permeable soils; monitor microbial flux.

3. **One Health Surveillance**
   • Joint wildlife–livestock–human sentinel networks using eDNA and metagenomics to flag pathogen emergence before spillover.

4. **Agro-Biodiverse Diets**
   • Integrate neglected and under-utilised species (NUS) into public food procurement; leverage carbon-credit markets for on-farm biodiversity.

5. **Global Allergy Plan 2.0 (GAP-2)**
   • Scale soil-based microbial exposure interventions; develop regulatory frameworks for “live environmental biotherapeutics.”

6. **Financial Instruments**
   • Biodiversity-linked health bonds; premium reductions for insurers when biodiversity targets met in catchments affecting policyholders.

## 8. Research Gaps & Future Directions

1. **Longitudinal Multi-Omics Cohorts** within biodiversity gradients; couple environmental, host-microbiome, and exposome data.

2. **Attribution Modelling**: Combine causal inference (Do-calculus) with agent-based simulations to discern directionality amid socio-economic confounders.

3. **Microbial Biodiversity Metrics**: Move beyond 16S/ITS richness to functional metagenomics and metabolomics.

4. **Valuation Frameworks**: Incorporate health externalities into natural-capital accounting; quantify co-benefits in cost–benefit analyses.

5. **Equity Lens**: Examine how biodiversity-health linkages interact with social determinants; avoid “green gentrification.”

## 9. Recommendations for Analysts & Decision-Makers

1. Treat biodiversity as a *leading* rather than lagging indicator of population health and embed it into health surveillance dashboards.
2. Prioritize cross-sectoral interventions where biodiversity gains and health gains align (e.g., regenerative agriculture, wetland restoration for flood mitigation and vector control).
3. Beware macro-level statistical artefacts; supplement with meso- and micro-scale causal studies.
4. Develop scenario analyses incorporating extinction debts and health lag times (>20 years) for long-term policy appraisal.
5. Promote data interoperability across environmental and health ministries; mandate FAIR principles for biodiversity-health datasets.

## 10. Concluding Remarks

We face an unprecedented acceleration of extinction—projected ≥50 000 species yr⁻¹ and >1 million extinctions by mid-century. The *Savage Sextet* drivers simultaneously erode ecosystem services and create novel health hazards. While direct statistical links remain elusive at coarse scales, mechanistic and case-study evidence underscores profound, multi-dimensional dependencies between biodiversity and human health. Bridging the evidence gap will require **integrated surveillance, mechanistic multi-omics research, and innovative policy instruments** that internalise biodiversity’s health externalities. Failure to act risks entrenching a trajectory where biodiversity loss and health inequities co-evolve, compromising planetary resilience.
