## 1. Introduction

Grassland ecosystems are globally recognized for their biodiversity and ecosystem services. Over the past several decades, intensified land management practices such as fertilization have helped boost agricultural productivity, but they have also led to notable shifts in plant community composition and overall biodiversity. This report synthesizes key learnings from a broad range of previous research on the most common effects of fertilization on grassland plant diversity, emphasizing the nuanced impacts observed under various nutrient regimes, treatment durations, and ecosystem compartments.

The central focus is to answer: "What is the most common effect of fertilization on grassland plant diversity?" Given the layered research insights, we review both short-term and long-term research outcomes, consider multiple fertilizer types (nitrogen, phosphorus, combined treatments), and discuss scale-specific responses that include aboveground plant communities and belowground biotic assemblages.

## 2. Overview of Fertilization Treatments

### 2.1 Types of Fertilizers

Research has differentiated between various fertilizer inputs as follows:

- **Nitrogen (N) Fertilizers:** Widely used to enhance biomass production, yet high application rates (e.g., 160–320 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) have been consistently linked to declines in plant species diversity.
- **Phosphorus (P) Fertilizers:** These are particularly critical in phosphorus-limited systems, where added P can shift community composition notably by reducing species that rely on efficient internal P acquisition mechanisms.
- **Combined Nutrient Treatments (NPK):** Using multiple nutrients simultaneously (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) can lead to contrasting impacts within the same ecosystem, particularly when considered alongside varying management practices such as mowing or grazing.

### 2.2 Application Context and Management Practices

Understanding the context of fertilization also requires an analysis of the management practices that accompany nutrient addition. For example, mowing regimes and other mechanical management strategies interact with nutrient levels, thus influencing both above- and belowground community dynamics. These interactions are important when evaluating the differential success or failure of species in response to nutrient enrichment.

## 3. Short-term vs. Long-term Effects

### 3.1 Short-Term Impacts

Short-term fertilization experiments consistently demonstrate an initial, rapid decline in plant species richness within grassland ecosystems. Key observations include:

- **Rapid Decline in Species Richness:** Within the first few years, nutrient additions lead to competitive hierarchies where fast-growing species outcompete less competitive, stress-tolerant species, resulting in a visible drop in overall diversity.
- **Aboveground Dominance:** Enhanced biomass production coupled with intensified light competition is observed, as taller, fast-growing species dominate and suppress lower-growing species, a phenomenon particularly noticeable under high nitrogen inputs.

### 3.2 Long-Term Effects

Long-term experiments, spanning decades, reveal a more complex picture:

- **Partial Recovery of Diversity:** Some long-term studies (e.g., 50-year experiments in The Netherlands) indicate that following an initial steep decline, there can be a partial recovery of species richness after around 25 years of continuous nutrient addition. This suggests that although initial impacts are deleterious, ecological processes and successional dynamics may enable reassembly or adaptation to enriched conditions.
- **Persistent Community Shifts:** More than mere count recoveries, long-term fertilization has been seen to induce substantial shifts in plant community composition, altering functional group distributions (for example, the decline in forbs and legumes in favor of grasses) that persist over extended periods.
- **Soil pH Alterations:** In studies such as those conducted on the Palace Leas Hay Meadow over 120 years, inorganic N fertilizers have led to sustained soil acidification (pH dropping below 4.5), which further compounds the decline in sensitive taxa, notably forbs and legumes.

## 4. Nutrient-Specific and Combined Fertilizer Effects

### 4.1 Phosphorus-Driven Dynamics

A critical finding from previous research indicates that phosphorus plays a decisive role in maintaining higher species diversity in phosphorus-limited systems:

- **Species Richness Maintenance:** Grasslands under phosphorus-limited conditions tend to maintain higher biodiversity because native species have adapted efficient phosphorus acquisition strategies. However, when phosphorus is supplemented—either by itself or in combination with other nutrients—it can lead to a decline in both endangered species and overall richness. The mechanisms involve shifts in competitive dynamics whereby species unable to cope with additional P inputs are outcompeted by faster-growing taxa.

### 4.2 Nitrogen Fertilization

Nitrogen is frequently the focus of many experiments due to its role in boosting productivity:

- **Biomass Production and Light Competition:** The application of large nitrogen doses consistently promotes biomass growth, which exacerbates light competition and effectively suppresses lower-stature plant species, leading to a loss in species diversity.
- **Soil pH Impacts:** High rates of nitrogen addition are associated with soil acidification, indirectly impacting biodiversity by rendering the soil environment less hospitable for sensitive species.

### 4.3 NPK and Combined Treatments

Combined nutrient management (NPK) consistently shows contrasting impacts:

- **Differing Responses Across Ecosystem Components:** While plant diversity, particularly among grasses and forbs, tends to decline with NPK treatments, belowground soil biota (including nematodes, collembolans, mites, and enchytraeids) may display either increases in diversity or altered community compositions. This divergence between aboveground and belowground responses highlights that short-term nutrient additions can mask longer-term, more complex ecosystem shifts.
- **Management Interactions:** The outcomes of combined nutrient fertilization are critically dependent on concurrent management practices such as mowing or grazing. These practices modulate how functional groups within the soil and plant communities interface under nutrient enrichment.

## 5. Ecosystem Responses: Aboveground vs. Belowground

### 5.1 Plant Communities

The direct implications of fertilization on plant communities include:

- **Decline in Species Richness:** Across numerous studies, the most common outcome is a decline in plant species diversity, particularly under heavy nitrogen or NPK fertilization regimes.
- **Alterations in Community Composition:** Species with rapid growth and competitive strategies tend to dominate, while stress-tolerant or slow-growing species decline. This often results in a homogenized plant community, which might have long-term repercussions for ecosystem resilience and function.

### 5.2 Soil Biota and Microbial Communities

The impacts of fertilization are not restricted to aboveground biomass. Belowground components, including microbial and faunal communities, often display responses that can run counter to the trends observed in plant communities:

- **Increase in Soil Biotic Diversity:** Several studies have reported that while plant diversity declines, organisms such as nematodes, collembolans, and mites may experience an increase in diversity under nutrient additions. This suggests that the ecosystem’s belowground compartment may compensate for or even benefit from nutrient inputs in ways that are not immediately apparent from aboveground observations.
- **Functional Group Shifts:** The composition of soil biota shifts in response to fertilization, with certain functional groups becoming more prominent. This has implications for nutrient cycling, soil structure, and overall ecosystem health, potentially offsetting some of the negative impacts seen in plant communities.

## 6. Regional and Management Considerations

### 6.1 Regional Variability

While the general pattern of diversity decline is well-documented across multiple studies, regional differences do exist:

- **Grasslands in Phosphorus-Limited Regions:** Grasslands that have evolved under natural phosphorus limitations tend to be more sensitive to phosphorus additions, resulting in more pronounced declines in species richness.
- **Climatic and Edaphic Factors:** The impact of fertilization is further modulated by local climate, soil type, and historical land-use patterns. Regions with inherent soil fertility or buffering capacities (e.g., areas with naturally higher organic matter content) might exhibit different dynamics compared to more marginal systems.

### 6.2 Management Practices

Integrated management practices play a prominent role in mediating the effects of fertilization:

- **Conventional vs. Organic Inputs:** Long-term studies (such as those at the Palace Leas Hay Meadow) reveal that inorganic fertilizers lead to persistent soil acidification and a decline in sensitive functional groups, whereas organic fertilizers (e.g., farmyard manure) tend to buffer pH and enhance soil organic carbon stocks, potentially mitigating biodiversity losses.
- **Mowing and Grazing Regimes:** These practices can interact synergistically or antagonistically with fertilizer effects. For example, regular mowing may limit the dominance of fast-growing species, thereby maintaining some level of species heterogeneity even under fertilized conditions.

## 7. Discussion and Implications for Grassland Biodiversity

### 7.1 Synthesizing Research Findings

The preponderance of evidence suggests that the **most common effect of fertilization on grassland plant diversity is a decline in species richness**. This is primarily driven by:

- **Enhanced Competitive Exclusion:** Fertilizer inputs boost the growth of dominant species, leading to competitive exclusion of less dominant, often rare or endangered species.
- **Shift in Functional Composition:** With the decline of forbs and legumes, grassland ecosystems tend to become homogenized, often dominated by nutrient-responsive grass species.
- **Indirect Environmental Effects:** Changes in soil pH, particularly under high nitrogen regimes, further exacerbate loss of sensitive taxa.

### 7.2 Complex Interactions and Resilience

It is critical to recognize the complexity underpinning these responses. While initial declines in diversity are robust findings in short-term studies, some long-term experiments suggest that ecological processes (e.g., recruitment and successional turnover) may lead to partial recovery of plant richness over decades. Nonetheless, these recoveries are often accompanied by permanent shifts in species composition and soil properties, implying that the ecosystem’s functional resilience has been fundamentally altered.

### 7.3 Belowground Considerations

The divergence between aboveground and belowground responses underlines the need for integrated ecosystem assessments. While plant diversity tends to decline, increases in soil biotic diversity might offer counterbalancing ecosystem services, such as enhanced nutrient cycling or soil structure maintenance. However, these benefits do not negate the loss of aboveground diversity, which is essential for overall ecosystem multifunctionality and resilience.

## 8. Conclusions and Future Directions

### 8.1 Key Conclusions

Based on the compiled research, the most common effect of fertilization on grassland plant diversity is a **decline in species richness**. This outcome is mediated by several interconnected factors:

- Direct physiological and ecological effects of excessive nutrient availability that favor highly competitive species.
- Alterations in key environmental parameters such as soil pH, which further tip the balance against sensitive taxa.
- The complex interplay between management practices (such as mowing and grazing) and fertilizer type (inorganic vs. organic) that modulates both short- and long-term responses.

### 8.2 Recommendations for Future Research

Given the accumulated evidence, several avenues for future research are suggested:

1. **Integrated Aboveground-Belowground Studies:** Future studies should adopt a holistic view of ecosystem responses, systematically correlating changes in plant diversity with shifts in microbial and faunal communities. This could uncover compensatory mechanisms that are not evident when studying plant communities in isolation.

2. **Longitudinal Multiscalar Experiments:** Expanding long-term experiments that document not only the temporal evolution of species richness but also the underlying shifts in community composition and soil properties are needed. More information on decades-long recovery processes will help refine our understanding of resilience dynamics following fertilization.

3. **Differential Effects of Organic vs. Inorganic Nutrient Inputs:** There is a clear need to further investigate how organic amendments may buffer some of the negative consequences of fertilization, particularly with regard to soil pH and overall ecosystem multifunctionality.

4. **Management Practice Modulation:** Research that focuses on integrating fertilization with traditional management practices (mowing, controlled grazing) could reveal best practices that mitigate biodiversity losses while sustaining agricultural productivity.

5. **Regional and Climatic Variability:** Lastly, comparative studies across differing climatic regions and soil types will elucidate the degree to which generalizations can be drawn about fertilization impacts globally, thereby providing more tailored recommendations for site-specific management.

### 8.3 Final Remarks

In summary, the prevailing and most commonly observed effect of fertilization on grassland plant diversity is a decline in species richness—a pattern that is robust across diverse experimental designs, nutrient regimes, and ecological contexts. However, the long-term perspectives indicate that the relationships are far from simple. Resilience mechanisms, belowground processes, and management interactions all play significant roles in modulating these outcomes. Recognizing and integrating these complexities will be vital for developing sustainable grassland management practices that safeguard both productivity and biodiversity in a rapidly changing world.
