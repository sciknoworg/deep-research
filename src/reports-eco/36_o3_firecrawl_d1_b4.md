# Deep‐Sea Radionuclide Biogeochemistry Under Extreme Pressure–Temperature Regimes

## 1. Scope and Motivation
The deep sea (>1000 m) imposes **hydrostatic pressures up to 110 MPa** and temperatures generally between −1 °C and 4 °C. These conditions modify virtually every physicochemical and biological rate constant that controls how radionuclides (RN) move from seawater or particles into organisms, redistribute among tissues, and are ultimately excreted or retained. Understanding these processes is pivotal for:

* Reconstructing contaminant source terms (Sellafield, Fukushima, Semipalatinsk fall-out, nuclear-powered submarine losses) via biomonitoring.
* Constraining seafood radiological dose assessments that now must extend to mesopelagic and bathypelagic species entering globalised markets (e.g., sablefish, Chilean sea bass, red crab).
* Building robust mechanistic models suitable for **decommissioning discharges** (e.g., TEPCO ALPS water release) and the **growing interest in deep‐sea mining tailings**.

Because the user’s earlier clarifying questions remained unanswered, this review deliberately covers **both naturally occurring (NORs) and anthropogenic (ANRs) radionuclides** and compares responses across several depth zones and taxonomic groups. We give equal weight to empirical field/lab data and to emerging modelling/sensor approaches where they illuminate pressure–temperature (P–T) effects.

## 2. Physicochemical Context
### 2.1 Speciation and Partitioning Under High P–T
Pressure up to 110 MPa has minimal direct impact on ionic speciation of major RNs because compressibilities of aqueous ions are small; however, **temperature remains the dominant control on complexation constants**. At 2 °C, complexes of Cs⁺ with chloride remain weak, whereas PoO₂²⁻ and Am(OH)₃ show slightly enhanced association with organic ligands (humic substances, thiols). This indirectly influences:

* **Water–particle partition coefficient (K_d)**; colder water increases organic matter preservation, favouring particle‐reactive NORs (²¹⁰Po, ²³⁹Pu) settling fluxes.
* **Dissolved/particulate ratios** entering benthic boundary layers – a key exposure pathway for deposit feeders.

### 2.2 Sediment Dynamics
Deep‐sea sediments often accumulate only millimetres per kyr. Yet **bioturbation to 30 cm** (Sellafield Irish Sea analogue) causes a kinetic decoupling: inventories grow sluggishly, but fauna can access decades of legacy nuclides that have been mixed upward.

## 3. Biological Uptake and Retention Mechanisms
### 3.1 Temperature Differentials
Empirical findings (Asterias forbesi, blue mussels):

* **Ingestion pathway:** Low T (≈2 °C) *prolongs* RN residence times dramatically (e.g., t₁⁄₂ of ²⁴¹Am → ∞ vs. 31 d at 12 °C).
* **Dissolved pathway:** Uptake rate constants (k_u) for ¹³⁷Cs drop >50 % at low T, but elimination (k_e) also slows, often cancelling out in the concentration factor (CF = k_u/k_e).

Hence in polar/deep systems, **dietary exposure dominates bioaccumulation risk**; extrapolations from temperate data under‐predict body burdens of Cs, Pu, Po by factors of 2–10.

### 3.2 Pressure‐Driven Physiological Adaptations
High P selects for:

1. **Piezolytes and membrane restructuring** that alter permeability and cation transporters.
2. **Reduced metabolic and gut‐transit rates (GTR).** Many hadal holothurians show GTR >72 h vs. 4–12 h in shallow counterparts ⇒ longer contact time between gut epithelium and RN‐bearing particles.
3. **High‐PUFA lipid stores** that bind monovalent cations (Cs⁺) and chalcophilic anions (PoO₂²⁻).
4. **Piezophilic microbiomes** capable of redox cycling Pu and Am within guts or in detrital flocs.

The net consequence is **enhanced bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) and slower depuration** relative to surface taxa even when dissolved uptake drops.

### 3.3 Trophic Enrichment Examples
* Deep‐water megafauna frequently exceed **²¹⁰Po >100 Bq kg⁻¹ (wet)**.
* Benthic dab (Limanda limanda) in the Irish Sea reached **1 × 10³ Bq kg⁻¹ of ¹⁴C** via rapid ingestion of labelled POC.
* Abyssal deposit feeders exhibit **¹³⁷Cs BCFs of 10²–10³**, exceeding IAEA default CF (100) used in ERICA Tier-1 risk tools.

## 4. Case Studies Synthesised from the Literature and Learnings
| Pressure–Temperature Setting | Taxon / Functional Group | Target RN | Key Empirical Finding | Learning Incorporated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 MPa, 2 °C (polar) | Asterias forbesi (sea star) | ²⁴¹Am, ⁵⁷Co, ¹³⁷Cs | Infinite retention of ingested Am/Co; >50 % reduction in Cs dissolved uptake | Learning 1, 4, 5 |
| Shelf, 15 m, 8–12 °C | Limanda limanda | ¹⁴C | Up to 1 × 10³ Bq kg⁻¹ via benthic feeding | Learning 2, 10 |
| 0–4 °C, 50–110 MPa | Hypothetical hadal holothurian | ²¹⁰Po, ²³⁹Pu | Model projections: BAF increased 3–5× vs. surface congeners due to prolonged gut passage | Learning 7, 11 |
| Arctic intertidal | Mytilus edulis | trace metals (proxy) | k_u ↓, k_e ↓, CF ~constant | Learning 8 |
| Consumer exposure (São Paulo market) | Various fish | ⁴⁰K, ¹³⁷Cs, NORs | Committed dose <0.1 mSv y⁻¹ | Learning 3 |

## 5. Modelling Status and Gaps
### 5.1 Shortcomings of Existing ICRP/ERICA Frameworks
Present biokinetic models assume:

* First-order uptake/elimination constants **independent of P–T**.
* Reference organism library lacks any entry beyond 1000 m depth.

Thus, doses to deep-sea fauna or to humans via hadal species are **systematically biased low**.

### 5.2 Needed Parameterisations
Based on Learning 7, the following traits must be introduced into next-generation models:

1. **Pressure‐corrected membrane transport coefficients.**
2. **Temperature–gut transit coupling** to extend biological residence times.
3. **Lipid‐adjusted distribution volumes** for Cs, Po, Am.
4. **Microbiome‐mediated remobilisation factors** (e.g., H₂‐driven Pu(VI) → Pu(IV) reduction in guts).

### 5.3 Experimental Infrastructure
The **IPOCAMP high-pressure flow‐through aquarium** is currently the most advanced platform (20 MPa, 2–40 °C) enabling factorial experiments on P–T interactions without decompression artefacts (Learning 13). Extending IPOCAMP to 60 MPa would cover 99 % of abyssal habitats.

## 6. Synthesis of Pressure–Temperature Effects
1. **Pressure mainly acts indirectly** by reshaping physiology, while **temperature directly slows biokinetics**.
2. **Dietary pathways gain prominence** as both pressure (through slower digestion) and cold (through retention) synergise.
3. **Net bioaccumulation can increase** even when uptake from water decreases, because elimination is even slower.
4. **Anthropogenic and natural RNs diverge in behaviour**: particle‐reactive NORs (²¹⁰Po, ²²⁶Ra) exploit the prolonged gut residence more than conservative ANRs (¹³⁷Cs), although high lipid content can counterbalance for Cs.

## 7. Implications for Human and Ecological Risk
* Fish sold in São Paulo show negligible current risk (<0.1 mSv y⁻¹), but these data come from shelf/slope fisheries (Learning 3). Transferring such limits to deep-caught species could be non-conservative.
* Emerging **mesopelagic fishmeal industries** (lanternfish, krill) may introduce higher ²¹⁰Po into poultry/pig diets unless monitored.
* **¹³⁷Cs chronological dating of sediments** (Learning 12) is becoming unreliable––modellers must not rely on surface sediment peaks to infer recent ANR inventories in abyssal zones.

## 8. Contrarian and Forward-Looking Perspectives (Speculative)
1. **Deep‐sea mining plumes** could *dilute* existing RN body burdens by delivering Fe/Mn oxides that scavenge dissolved NORs before ingress (moderate confidence).
2. **Synthetic biology** offers the possibility of engineering piezophilic bacteria that sequester Pu/Am within exopolymers, creating living biobarriers around leak sites (highly speculative).
3. **In-situ laser‐induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)** on autonomous benthic landers may soon quantify ¹³⁷Cs in interstitial waters at depth, bypassing core retrieval artefacts.

## 9. Recommendations for Future Work
1. **Extend IPOCAMP or equivalent systems to ≥60 MPa** and couple with *γ-spectrometric flow cells* to measure real-time uptake.
2. Develop **pressure–temperature scaling laws** for k_u and k_e using Arrhenius and activation volume concepts; validate with Pu, Po, Cs across 2–20 °C and 0.1–60 MPa.
3. **Sequence and functionally annotate hadal microbiomes** to quantify microbial RN redox cycling genes.
4. Create an **open, global biokinetic parameter database** tagged by P–T, species, life stage, and exposure pathway.

## 10. Key Take-Home Messages
* Low temperature increases retention of ingested RNs far more than it suppresses dissolved uptake.
* High pressure amplifies this effect via slower gut throughput and altered membrane transport.
* Models ignoring P–T dependence under-estimate RN burdens and hence ecological risk in deep zones.
* Technology now exists (pressure aquaria, in-situ sensors) to close remaining data gaps.
