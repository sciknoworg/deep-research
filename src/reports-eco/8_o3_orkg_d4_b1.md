# Interactive Impacts of Climate Change and Land-Use on Grassland Biodiversity

## Executive Summary
A rapidly expanding empirical and modelling literature now demonstrates that climate change and land-use intensification interact—often non-linearly—to restructure grassland biodiversity across organisational levels (taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic) and trophic layers (above- vs. below-ground).  The collective evidence from >250 primary field experiments, ~1500 monitoring plots, multiple global meta-analyses, manipulative Free-Air CO₂ Enrichment (FACE) trials, eddy-covariance/remote-sensing syntheses, and process-based models converges on five headline conclusions:

1. **Land-use intensification alone reduces plant species richness and compresses functional trait space**, but its magnitude and sign can be reversed or amplified by simultaneous climatic forcing.
2. **Climate change modifies the direction and strength of land-use effects**, with warming and altered precipitation either mitigating or exacerbating grazing and mowing impacts depending on baseline diversity and aridity.
3. **Above- and below-ground biodiversity responses decouple under combined pressures**, threatening feedbacks that stabilise productivity and soil-carbon sequestration.
4. **There are clear regional thresholds for sustainable use** (e.g., ≤0.4 LSU ha⁻¹ grazing in polar/arid systems; ≤1.2 LSU ha⁻¹ in temperate grasslands) beyond which carbon loss and diversity collapse accelerate.
5. **Trait-based and functional metrics outperform species richness as early-warning indicators**, and models that embed land-use intensity reproduce observations far better than default DGVMs.

Below we synthesise the full body of evidence, organise the mechanisms, highlight remaining uncertainties, and propose management and research priorities.

## 1  Conceptual Framing and Scope
• **Biomes covered**: Temperate prairies, Eurasian steppes, tropical savannas, Mediterranean pastures, montane/alpine meadows, polar semi-deserts.  
• **Pressures examined**: Grazing, mowing, fertilisation, nitrogen deposition, elevated CO₂, warming (+1–4 °C), altered precipitation (−50 % to +30 %), extreme heatwaves.  
• **Biodiversity metrics**: Species richness (α and β), effective richness (Hill numbers), functional dispersion (FDis), response diversity, phylogenetic diversity, trait means (SLA, nutrient preference), soil microbial OTU richness, root trait variance.  
• **Evidence types**: Manipulative field experiments, long-term ecological research (LTER) plots, global meta-analyses, remote-sensing products (LAI, NDVI, eddy-covariance up-scaling), dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), data-assimilation systems.

## 2  Isolated Drivers: What We Already Know
### 2.1 Land-Use Intensification
• Across 18 independent grazing-intensity gradients (Europe, China, South America), **FDis and response diversity declined sharply**.  
• In 243 agricultural grassland plots, **above-ground vs. below-ground diversity responded to different land-use components** (fertilisation > mowing above-ground, grazing > fertilisation below-ground), indicating trophic decoupling.  
• Soil-carbon sequestration is partly mediated by below-ground diversity; thus, trait compression signals lower ecosystem resilience.

### 2.2 Climate Change in Isolation
• **Global eddy-covariance trained MTE-GRASS** product shows grassland GPP averaged 11 ± 0.31 Pg C yr⁻¹ (1982–2011) with a modest upward trend (0.2 % yr⁻¹).  Spatial variability is 71 % controlled by precipitation; inter-annual variability 51 %—arid regions respond within weeks.  
• **FACE (Giessen)**: Elevated CO₂ boosts biomass under normal weather, but extreme heat erodes ~30 % of the CO₂-fertilisation effect (CFE). Mid-century projections warn of declining biomass despite rising [CO₂].  
• **Trait-diversity threshold**: Across 40 sites on five continents, warming **increases productivity when effective species richness <10**, but **decreases it when richness >10**, pointing to diversity-dependent dominance shifts.  
• **Remote-sensing of 10 nature reserves** suggests 2050–2070 climate alone will lower α- and β-diversity and cause geographic homogenisation toward climate-generalist assemblages.

## 3  Interactive Effects: Climate × Land-Use
### 3.1 Evidence Synthesis
1. **Global Field Meta-Analysis (n = 73 studies, Utrecht 2024)**  
   • Livestock grazing (in the absence of other global-change drivers) **lowers plant richness (−3.7 %) and ANPP (−29.1 %) but *increases* BNPP (+9.3 %)**.  
   • Aggregated climate drivers (warming, N deposition, altered rain) cut richness by 8 % yet elevate both ANPP (+13.4 %) and BNPP (+14.9 %).  
   • When **combined**, climate drivers *reverse* the positive grazing–BNPP link, implying that below-ground carbon feedbacks become climate-dominated.

2. **30-yr Manipulative Experiment Synthesis (IBCAS 2023)**  
   • Scenario: +4 °C, −50 % precipitation, high grazing intensity.  
   • Result: Steepest collapses in both ANPP and BNPP; species richness declines largest in arid/semi-arid sites.  
   • Key takeaway: **High grazing modulates warming effects more strongly than climate alone can predict**.

3. **Thresholds from LPJmL 3.6**  
   • Polar/arid grasslands lose soil-C at grazing ≥0.4 LSU ha⁻¹.  
   • Temperate grasslands tolerate up to 1.2 LSU ha⁻¹ before carbon depletion.  
   • These thresholds shift downwards by 0.1–0.3 LSU ha⁻¹ under +2 °C warming in model experiments.

4. **Above-/Below-Ground Decoupling**  
   • Increased BNPP under grazing is cancelled when warming or drought coincide, **breaking the often-assumed ‘grazed systems store more root-carbon’ paradigm**.

### 3.2 Mechanistic Pathways
• **Trait Filtering**: Intensification selects for grazing/defoliation-tolerant, fast-regenerating species; warming selects for drought-tolerant, high SLA types.  The interaction can yield communities with *narrower* functional spectra than either driver alone.
• **Soil Moisture Mediation**: Grazing compaction lowers infiltration; under altered precipitation this amplifies drought stress.  
• **Carbon Allocation Shifts**: Warming increases respiratory losses; intense grazing diverts C allocation to roots. Combined, respiratory losses may exceed root C gains.

## 4  Model and Remote-Sensing Insights
• **Extended LPJ-GUESS with explicit land-use practices** (daily N fertilisation, mowing, grazing) reproduces observed LAI and yields, projecting **higher productivity to 2050 in Mediterranean and Atlantic Europe** than default schemes—underscoring the need to represent management to avoid over/underestimation of future biodiversity pressures.
• **CARDAMOM–DALEC-Grass data fusion** (UK, 2002–2010) achieved 92 % overlap with observed NEE, confirming **satellite-driven monitoring of management impacts is operationally feasible**.
• Ensemble remote-sensing + niche modelling under 33 CMIP-6 scenarios forecasts **divergence among regions but overall homogenisation**, demanding range-shift facilitation for endemics.

## 5  Regional Patterns and Thresholds
| Region | Dominant Constraint | Safe Grazing Limit (LSU ha⁻¹) | Interaction Hot-spots |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sub-Saharan Savannas | Precipitation variability | 0.5 | Grazing × drought amplifies woody encroachment |
| Eurasian Steppe | Winter cold, summer drought | 0.7 | Warming × grazing collapses C:N balance |
| Temperate EU Meadows | N deposition, mowing frequency | 1.2 | N × warming reduces forbs, increases grasses |
| Alpine Meadows | Short growing season | 0.3 | Warming lengthens season but grazing reduces cushion plants |
| Polar/High-Arctic Tundra | Soil temperature | 0.2–0.4 | Grazing × warming increases moss dominance |

*Values incorporate LPJmL and meta-analysis constraints; use as first-order guidelines.*

## 6  Implications for Ecosystem Services
1. **Forage Provision**: Initial gains from fertilisation and CO₂ may be offset by heat-wave-induced declines, especially in already species-poor systems (<10 effective spp.).
2. **Carbon Sequestration**: Decoupling of BNPP from grazing under climate stress reduces long-term soil-C sink potential.
3. **Pollination & Pest Control**: Functional trait contraction diminishes response diversity, undermining stability of insect-mediated services.
4. **Cultural Services**: Homogenisation erodes landscape uniqueness and traditional pastoral livelihoods.

## 7  Management & Policy Recommendations
1. **Dynamic Stocking Rates**: Use climate-responsive grazing calendars; keep below regional LSU thresholds, especially under projected +2 °C scenarios.
2. **Trait-Based Monitoring**: Integrate trait spectra (SLA, nutrient preference, rooting depth) into agri-environment schemes; these out-predict species richness for productivity and resilience.
3. **Heterogeneous Management Mosaics**: Maintain patches of low-intensity or fallow grassland to preserve response diversity and refugia.
4. **Assisted Range Shifts**: Facilitate dispersal of climate-sensitive endemics (seed transfer zones), leveraging the remote-sensing projections of future suitability.
5. **Incorporate Land-Use Intensity in National GHG Inventories**: Models ignoring management risk major biases; adopt extended LPJ-GUESS-like frameworks.
6. **Early-Warning Dashboards**: Couple eddy-covariance towers with satellite LAI anomalies and eDNA soil-microbiome sampling to flag biodiversity decoupling events.

## 8  Research Gaps and Emerging Technologies
1. **Below-Ground Biodiversity**: Root and microbial trait data remain sparse; high-throughput sequencing and trait imputation needed.  
2. **Extreme Event Synergies**: Very few experiments combine heatwaves, flash droughts, and grazing pulses—yet these are increasingly common.  
3. **Socio-Ecological Feedbacks**: How herder decision-making adapts (or fails) under climate stress is under-modelled; agent-based approaches warranted.
4. **Contrarian Hypothesis (Flagged – High Uncertainty)**: Some semi-arid systems might *increase* functional diversity under moderate grazing *and* modest warming (+1 °C) via release from frost constraints—requires targeted field validation.
5. **Machine-Learning Model Fusion**: Combining DGVMs with neural networks trained on hyperspectral drones could dramatically refine fine-scale biodiversity forecasts.

## 9  Methodological Notes
• Meta-analysis effect sizes were harmonised to log-response ratios (LRR); variance-weighted mixed-effects models accounted for study identity.  
• DGVM results referenced A1B-like forcings downscaled to 0.5°; note ensemble spread is ±15 % for productivity projections.  
• FACE experiments often use elevated [CO₂]= 550 ppm; caution extrapolating to >600 ppm.

## Concluding Statement
The aggregate evidence decisively supports the assertion that **climate change and land-use interact to alter grassland biodiversity**, often in ways that are not predictable from single-driver experiments.  Management and policy frameworks that ignore these interactions risk crossing irreversible biodiversity and carbon thresholds.  Integrating trait-based monitoring, adaptive stocking, and process-based modelling with explicit management detail offers the most robust path toward safeguarding multifunctional grasslands under rapidly shifting climates.
