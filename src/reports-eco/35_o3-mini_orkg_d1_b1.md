# Mechanisms Driving the Biodiversity–Ecosystem Function Relationship in Ecosystems Beyond Grasslands: An Integrative Analysis

## 1. Introduction

Biodiversity–Ecosystem Function (BEF) relationships are widely recognized as core drivers of ecosystem resilience, productivity, and service provisioning. While grassland ecosystems have historically served as primary study systems, recent integrative frameworks have shifted the focus towards understanding these dynamics in a range of other ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, marine systems, and deserts. This report synthesizes emerging research findings from both empirical and modeling perspectives, incorporating novel insights from long-term studies and theoretical advances that merge BEF and food web theory.

The overarching goal is to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings that drive ecosystem functions across various habitats. We explore how specific components such as species diversity, trophic interactions, and the structure of non-trophic interactions interplay to shape functions like nutrient cycling, energy flux, and ecosystem stability. The review integrates learnings from multiple studies including model predictions and a pivotal 34-year time series from the Gulf of Riga, thereby offering a multi-layered perspective on BEF beyond grasslands.

## 2. Integrative Frameworks: Bridging BEF and Food Web Theory

### 2.1. Rationale for Integration

Recent advances have highlighted the necessity of merging traditional BEF models with food web theory. This integrative approach broadens the investigatory scope from simple species counts to a more nuanced understanding of how the complexity of species interactions—both trophic and non-trophic—influences key ecosystem processes. For example, model predictions and empirical evidence underscore that it is not merely the presence of species that matters, but also the diversity of their interactions (e.g., trophic complementarity, facilitation, competition, and interference).

### 2.2. Mechanistic Insights

- **Trophic Complementarity:** The concept of trophic complementarity is vital in predicting processes such as nutrient cycling and energy flux. Evidence from long-term data (e.g., the Gulf of Riga study) illustrates that alterations in the trophic structure can have cascading effects on ecosystem function.

- **Non-Trophic Interactions:** Interactions that do not involve direct consumption—such as space competition, predator interference, and recruitment facilitation—are seen to amplify the BEF relationship. Model-based studies suggest that these non-trophic interactions can steepen the slope of the diversity–function curve, a dynamic that implies that species losses might lead to disproportionate declines in biomass and production.

- **Empirical and Theoretical Synthesis:** Integrative approaches that combine empirical evidence (long-term time series, cross-ecosystem comparisons) with theoretical frameworks offer a robust avenue for predicting ecosystem responses. Such synthesis encourages a multi-scale evaluation of ecosystem processes, moving from fine-scale interactions to landscape-level dynamics.

## 3. Biodiversity–Ecosystem Function in Diverse Ecosystems

While grasslands provide a well-studied model, extending BEF research into other ecosystems reveals both novel challenges and opportunities. Below we discuss major ecosystems where these mechanisms have been explored and extrapolate potential management implications.

### 3.1. Forest Ecosystems

- **Species Interaction Networks:** In forests, the interplay between keystone tree species, understory diversity, and decomposers forms a complex network reminiscent of food webs. These networks determine nutrient cycling and energy transfer. The integrative framework helps in understanding how mutualistic interactions (e.g., mycorrhizal relationships) and competitive dynamics together influence forest structure and function.

- **Structural Complexity:** The vertical stratification and spatial heterogeneity in forests add an extra layer of complexity. Here, non-trophic interactions such as competition for light, root space, and soil nutrients can modify traditional BEF relationships.

### 3.2. Wetlands

- **Shifting Trophic Dynamics:** Wetlands, with their unique hydrological regimes, highlight the role of transient species and successional changes in modulating ecosystem functions. The interplay between aquatic vegetation, microbial processes, and invertebrates is critical in mediating processes like water purification and carbon sequestration.

- **Non-Trophic Effects:** In wetlands, non-feeding interactions such as spatial dominance and facilitation (e.g., plants creating microhabitats that protect sensitive species) strongly influence community dynamics and functional outputs.

### 3.3. Marine Systems

- **Multitrophic Food Webs:** Marine ecosystems are characterized by complex food webs that span a wide array of trophic levels. Here, the diversity of interactions—ranging from planktonic dynamics to apex predator behavior—plays a crucial role in energy flux and nutrient dynamics. Models integrating BEF with food web theory help predict changes in ecosystem services (e.g., fisheries productivity, carbon cycling) under shifting biodiversity scenarios.

- **Non-Trophic Facilitation:** Non-trophic interactions, such as habitat provisioning by coral reefs or seagrass meadows, have been identified as amplifiers of ecosystem function. These roles underline the importance of preserving both biodiversity and the myriad relationships that sustain ecosystem resilience.

### 3.4. Desert Ecosystems

- **Resource Scarcity and Facilitation:** In deserts, biodiversity is often low, yet the interactions present (including facilitation among plants) are critical for maintaining ecosystem stability. Species in desert systems often rely on facilitative interactions to overcome harsh abiotic conditions, thereby sustaining processes like soil stabilization and water retention.

- **Opposing Drivers:** In these systems, competition for scarce resources can be as important as niche complementarity. Integrative models that account for both trophic and non-trophic controls provide insight into how desert ecosystems respond to disturbances, such as climate extremes.

## 4. Multitrophic Perspectives and Non-Trophic Dynamics

### 4.1. Integrating Biotic and Abiotic Factors

A multitrophic perspective is essential for scaling BEF insights to management-relevant spatial and temporal scales. Incorporating abiotic factors alongside biotic interactions helps refine our understanding of ecosystem processes. For instance, shifts in climate variables, soil moisture, and nutrient availability interact with species-level processes to modify overall ecosystem function. Advanced models now include these elements to better predict outcomes under various changing scenarios.

### 4.2. The Role of FAIR Data Practices

One of the key recommendations emerging from this body of research is the implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data practices. Standardizing data collection and sharing protocols across diverse ecosystems enhances reproducibility, fosters meta-analyses, and sharpens conservation targets. Contributing datasets—from the Gulf of Riga long-term studies to forest community surveys—enable researchers to build more robust, predictive models that can be downscaled to specific management actions.

## 5. Implications for Ecosystem Management and Future Directions

### 5.1. Management-Relevant Spatial Scales

The combination of biodiversity metrics, food web insights, and a recognition of non-trophic processes provides managers with a more nuanced toolkit. For instance, in designing protected areas or restoration projects, understanding interaction diversity can inform habitat configurations that maximize ecosystem resilience.

### 5.2. Addressing Complex Disturbances

The emerging view emphasizes the need to account for both direct and indirect effects of species loss—not only in grasslands but across all ecosystems. With climate change and anthropogenic pressures modifying species distributions and interactions, predictive models that incorporate multitrophic and non-trophic dimensions are indispensable.

### 5.3. Advancing Research Directions

- **Enhanced Modeling Approaches:** Future work should employ coupled biogeochemical-ecological models that incorporate diverse interactions at multiple scales. This includes exploring network robustness and tipping points as species interactions shift under stressors.

- **Integrative Empirical Studies:** There is a clear need for more longitudinal studies in ecosystems like deserts, marine systems, and wetlands. Intensive, long-term monitoring paired with experimental interventions could unravel the causative mechanisms behind observed BEF relationships.

- **Innovative Data-Infrastructure:** The adoption of FAIR principles in data management stands as a cornerstone for advancing our understanding. Open-access databases that centralize multi-trophic and non-trophic interaction data can pave the way for more collaborative and cross-system analyses.

### 5.4. Speculative and Emerging Trends

Preliminary modeling based on evolving datasets suggests that in systems with high interaction complexity, biodiversity losses might lead to exponentially larger declines in ecosystem functions than previously anticipated. In a contrarian perspective, some emerging evidence hints that certain alterations in community structure might, under specific circumstances, lead to transient increases in function due to compensatory dynamics. However, these anomalous patterns require cautious interpretation and further validation.

## 6. Conclusion

The biodiversity–ecosystem function relationship is driven by an intricate web of trophic and non-trophic interactions that vary considerably across ecosystems. Our integrative approaches reveal that the diversity of species interactions—not merely species counts—controls key ecosystem processes, ranging from nutrient cycling to biomass production and energy flux. The inclusion of multitrophic perspectives and FAIR data practices are critical to translating experimental insights into management actions. As ecosystems face unprecedented global change, these insights not only enhance our understanding of ecological dynamics but also help to inform strategic decision-making aimed at bolstering ecosystem resilience.

In summary, extending BEF research beyond grasslands to include forests, wetlands, marine systems, and deserts shows that a detailed mechanistic understanding—encompassing both species interactions and their structural context—is necessary. Incorporating multi-trophic and non-trophic dynamics offers a more comprehensive view of ecosystem functioning, paving the way for innovative research and effective ecosystem management strategies in an era of rapid global change.
