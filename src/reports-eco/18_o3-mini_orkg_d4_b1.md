# Final Report: Utilizing Herbarium Specimens to Study the Effects of Climate Change

This report synthesizes a breadth of research advances that leverage herbaria specimens to explore and measure the impacts of climate change. Over the past decades, herbaria have transitioned from static records of botanical diversity to dynamic data repositories that, when coupled with modern analytical and remote-sensing techniques, illuminate changes in phenology, distribution, morphology, and genetic composition. This multidisciplinary integration of historical botanical collections with state-of-the-art technology has enabled researchers to reconstruct landscapes of past climate conditions and predict future ecological trajectories with unprecedented resolution.

## 1. Introduction and Context

Herbaria, with their extensive and temporally structured collections, offer a unique window into historical biodiversity. Traditionally curated for taxonomic and systematic studies, these specimens have recently been repurposed to study ecological responses to climate change. Modern digitization efforts have transformed these physical records into high-resolution digital images and associated metadata, thus enabling high-throughput analysis. The advent of advanced statistical and machine learning techniques has further bridged historical data with contemporary climate science, allowing for temporal and spatial tracking of ecological responses over centuries.

In the context of climate change, researchers are particularly interested in three primary areas of study:

- **Phenological Shifts**: Changes in the timing of life-cycle events, such as flowering or leaf unfolding.
- **Distributional Changes**: Alterations in the geographic ranges of species induced by shifting climatic envelopes.
- **Morphological Alterations**: Detectable physical changes, such as variations in leaf length or structure, that may be adaptive responses to changing environments.

This report draws on multiple learnings from recent studies that have successfully integrated traditional herbarium data with cutting-edge research tools such as genomic sequencing, remote sensing, and machine learning. These studies underscore the importance of a multi-scale approach that spans from cellular adaptations to ecosystem-level dynamics.

## 2. Advanced Integration of Genomic and Phenological Data

### 2.1 Genomic Techniques and Their Application

One of the most groundbreaking advancements involves coupling genomic analyses with ecological data from herbarium specimens. Methods such as genome-wide RNA sequencing, DNA variant detection, and DNA metabarcoding have been used to tease apart rapid evolutionary adaptations and assess phenotypic plasticity in various plant species. For instance, using a reduced representation sequencing method, researchers have compared historical and modern specimens over a 200-year time span. This approach has provided insights into genetic shifts in model species (e.g., *Arabidopsis thaliana*) and non-model species (e.g., *Cardamine bulbifera*), thereby revealing the genomic underpinnings of adaptation to persistent climate change.

### 2.2 Machine Learning-Enhanced Phenological Analysis

The digitization of herbaria has supported the development of machine learning workflows that extract phenological metrics from digitized specimen images. Advanced imaging analysis permits the precise quantification of developmental stages, such as first flowering dates, across millions of samples. Several studies have confirmed the reliability of these extracted data, noting, for example, a standardized advancement of approximately 6 days per °C increase in temperature for flowering events in species like *Ophrys sphegodes*. This consistency bolsters confidence in using herbaria as proxies for field observations.

A particularly forward-thinking integration involves the coupling of remote sensing data with ML-derived phenological cues. This combination allows for an assessment of biosphere–atmosphere interactions and aids in refining Earth system models. Causal graph reconstruction techniques and advanced inference frameworks (e.g., spectral Granger causality, high-dimensional VAR, PCMCI) have been instrumental in untangling the complex temporal relationships between environmental variables such as CO2 concentrations, water fluxes, and climatic drivers.

## 3. Exploring Morphological and Ecological Adaptations

### 3.1 Quantitative Morphometric Analyses

Herbaria specimens have provided quantifiable evidence of morphological change. A study on *Plantago lanceolata* from the KW-herbarium in Kyiv, Ukraine, documented measurable changes over the past century – including increases in leaf blade length (+3.0 cm), petiole length (+2.1 cm), and spike lengths (+0.6 cm). Such morphological shifts serve as proxies for adaptive responses to climate-induced stress. These quantitative morphometric studies underscore the potential for herbaria to offer insights into subtle, yet measurable, physical changes that have occurred over time in response to climatic drivers.

### 3.2 Spatial and Temporal Integration with Remote Sensing

Remote sensing data, when integrated with digitized herbarium records, provides a powerful approach to reconstruct past vegetational dynamics. This methodology has been applied successfully in both natural and agricultural systems. For example, ecosystem models integrated with remote sensing (e.g., DLEM-Ag over US cropping systems) have captured the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop phenology and climate interactions. Such integrations are highly informative in modeling ecosystem productivity and forecasting future impacts of climate variability. This multi-scale assessment is also pivotal in bridging macro and micro-level observations, such as linking microscopic genomic adaptations with visible morphological changes and large-scale ecosystem structure.

## 4. Methodological Innovations and Causal Inference

### 4.1 High-Resolution Spatial and Temporal Analyses

Enhanced machine learning workflows have significantly refined our ability to track climate impacts down to fine spatial resolutions. Studies incorporating random forests, Bayesian Spatial Hierarchical models, and downscaling methods have been particularly useful in controlling for confounders in environmental epidemiology studies. The refinement enables spatial heterogeneity assessments at granular scales—such as individual zip code level evaluations for extreme heat hospitalization burdens.

### 4.2 Causal Relationships and Ecological Inference

The reconstruction of causal graphs from dense data networks is a major methodological breakthrough. By applying causal inference frameworks, research now disentangles complex dependencies in biosphere–atmosphere interactions. Techniques like spectral Granger causality and PCMCI help address challenges such as hidden confounding, non-stationarity, and contemporaneous causation. Benchmark comparisons using observational data (e.g., Leaf Area Index (LAI) dynamics) against model outputs (e.g., CMIP5 data sets) have yielded insights that are critical for refining predictive models of climate impact.

These methods, now integrated with herbarium-based analyses, enable researchers to pose and answer more sophisticated questions: How do molecular adaptations align with measurable morphological changes? What are the feedbacks between evolutionary responses and ecosystem-level climate variables? Answering these questions is at the frontier of current research and demands continuous methodological innovation.

## 5. Case Studies and Empirical Evidence

### 5.1 Phenological Shifts as Climate Proxies

Multiple studies have validated the use of herbarium data as reliable measures of plant phenology. For instance, research spanning north-central North America has consistently shown that early flowering dates, identified from herbarium records, mirror direct field observations. The quantification of such shifts (e.g., a 6-day advancement per °C increase) provides definitive evidence of species-specific phenological cueing mechanisms, including dependencies on temperature, winter chilling, and photoperiod. These findings highlight the utility of herbarium specimens in tracking long-term ecological responses to climatic triggers.

### 5.2 Integrative Genomic and Morphological Adaptation

The integration of modern sequencing techniques (including ancient DNA with environmental DNA metabarcoding) with historical herbarium data illustrates the potential to reconstruct past vegetational dynamics comprehensively. This approach not only reveals historical shifts in gene pools but also associates genomic changes with observable morphological adaptations. Such studies on both model and non-model species underscore the multifaceted responses plants have towards sustained environmental pressures, illuminating both rapid evolutionary adjustments and gradual phenotypic plasticity.

## 6. Future Directions and Innovative Solutions

The evolving landscape of climate change research will continue to benefit from herbaria-based studies. Several prospective solutions and research directions are proposed:

1. **Development of Integrated Multi-Modal Databases:** Combining morphological, phenological, genomic, and remote sensing data into unified databases can streamline cross-scale analysis and enhance causal inference. A standardized, global digital herbarium repository with integrated analytical tools could serve as a backbone for global climate adaptation studies.

2. **Enhanced Machine Learning Models:** The next generation of machine learning models should integrate multi-source data streams (e.g., high-throughput genomic data, high-resolution remote sensing imagery, and historical phenological records). These models could leverage advanced architectures such as deep neural networks with attention mechanisms to capture nuanced relationships between climate variables and ecological observations.

3. **Application of Novel Causal Inference Techniques:** While existing frameworks (spectral Granger causality, PCMCI, etc.) have advanced our understanding significantly, developing tailored causal inference models that account for the temporal decay and seasonality inherent in both herbarium records and climate datasets will be crucial. This may involve hybrid models that integrate mechanistic understanding of plant physiology with statistical learning methods.

4. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Integrating expertise from fields such as remote sensing, genomics, machine learning, and climate science is essential. Future projects could be designed as interdisciplinary consortia, pooling resources across institutions to tackle global-scale questions with localized detail.

5. **Leveraging Citizen Science:** With the widespread availability of digital platforms and mobile applications, engaging citizen scientists for supplementary data collection (e.g., current phenological observations) can enhance calibration efforts and increase the temporal granularity of modern datasets.
