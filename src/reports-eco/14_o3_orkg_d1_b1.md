# Identifying Critical Habitat for Peary Caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi)

*Prepared 2025-06-04*

---

## 1  Executive Summary

The Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) is listed as Endangered under the Canadian Species at Risk Act (SARA). Delineating *critical habitat* (CH) is mandatory for federal recovery-strategy compliance and central to territorial and Indigenous co-management planning across Nunavut and the Northwest Territories (NWT). This report synthesises current science, Indigenous Knowledge (IK), regulatory guidance and advanced spatial-ecological methods to provide a defensible, transparent, and adaptable framework for identifying Peary caribou critical habitat at multiple spatio-temporal scales. The approach satisfies SARA’s legal tests, but is modular enough to feed broader land-use planning (e.g., Nunavut Planning Commission) and cumulative-effects assessments (CEA) under the Arctic Policy Framework.

Key recommendations:

1. Integrate multi-source movement data (>750 GPS-collared individuals since 2000) with IK (35 communities) through a Bayesian hierarchical Resource- and Step-Selection model (iRSF + iSSF) at 1-km monthly resolution.
2. Derive seasonal range envelopes (calving, post-calving, summer, rut, early winter, late winter) and designate CH polygons using the top 80 % utilisation kernel clipped by ecological thresholds (snow <35 cm, forage NDVI > 0.15, sea-ice divergence <20 km d⁻¹).
3. Explicitly embed climate-change projections (CMIP6 SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) for 2030, 2050, 2080 into the habitat-suitability surfaces; propagate uncertainty via ensemble downscaling (CanESM5, CESM2, MIROC6).
4. Produce decision-ready products: high-resolution (30 m) CH rasters, legally-defined polygon shapefiles, and narrative descriptions, with metadata conforming to Federal Geospatial Data Infrastructure (FGDI) ISO-19115.
5. Establish an adaptive monitoring loop (5-year cycle) leveraging low-cost Iridium collar tags, SAR (RADARSAT-Constellation) snow-depth analytics, and eDNA snow-pit sampling to validate and refine CH.

## 2  Regulatory & Governance Context

### 2.1  SARA Requirements

Under SARA s.2(1), critical habitat is “the habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species…” Federal recovery strategies must: 

1. Identify CH to the extent possible using best available information (s.41(1)(c)).
2. Provide a schedule for completing CH if information is insufficient.
3. Describe activities likely to destroy CH (ALTD).

### 2.2  Territorial & Indigenous Co-management

• Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB), Inuvialuit Game Council (IGC) and Hunters & Trappers Organizations (HTOs) hold primary wildlife management authority in their settlement regions.

• Land-use plans (e.g., North Baffin LUP) require harmonisation with federal CH delineations.

• Article 5 of the Nunavut Agreement obliges co-development and recognizes Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) as equivalent in weight to western science.

### 2.3  Overlapping Regulatory Triggers

• Impact Assessment Act (IAA 2019): CH polygons automatically trigger “fish and fish habitat”–analogous provisions for listed terrestrial species under s.79.

• Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act (MVRMA): Water licences and land-use permits must consider CH as Valued Components (VCs).

• Arctic shipping corridors (Northern Low Impact Shipping Corridors Initiative) intersect seasonal sea-ice CH; these require Transport Canada’s Protecting Arctic Seas approach.

## 3  Peary Caribou Ecology & Threat Drivers

| Attribute | Key Details |
|-----------|------------|
| Subspecies | *R. t. pearyi* (smallest bodied Rangifer, white pelage) |
| Distribution | High-Arctic archipelago: Banks, Victoria, Prince of Wales, Somerset, Ellesmere, Axel Heiberg, Bathurst, Devon, Melville islands |
| Demography | 4 meta-populations (western, central, eastern, high-Arctic) with low natality (0.51 calves · females⁻¹), episodic die-offs linked to rain-on-snow |
| Movement | Highly nomadic; annual ranges up to 12,000 km²; sea-ice crossings >100 km |
| Key Limiting Factors | Stochastic winter icing, altered snow regimes, predation (wolves), human disturbance (low), competition with muskoxen, pathogen spill-over (brucellosis) |

### 3.1  Functional Habitat Components

1. **Calving & Post-calving** (May–July): dry, windswept ridges with early snow-free phenology; minimal predator density.
2. **Summer Foraging** (July–Aug): mesic graminoid–forb meadows, sedge polygons near freshwater lakes.
3. **Rut** (Sept–Oct): valley bottoms with high forage; bulls actively defend harems.
4. **Wintering** (Nov–Apr): low-snow uplands, polar desert; critical access to saxifrage, purple saxifrage, Arctic willow.
5. **Sea-ice Corridors**: crucial for inter-island connectivity; preferred rough 1-year ice with low ridging.

## 5  Methodological Framework

### 5.1  Conceptual Overview

A two-tier approach is advocated:

1. **Habitat-Suitability Modelling (HSM)** – produce continuous surfaces of relative probability of use (0–1) for each season.
2. **Habitat Delineation & Classification** – convert HSM outputs to polygons meeting SARA’s CH definition.

### 5.2  Workflow Steps

#### Step 1  – Data Preparation & QA/QC

• Standardise telemetry to WGS84 / EPSG:5936 (Arctic Polar Stereographic).

• Remove location error >50 m; screen improbable steps via speed filter (>10 km h⁻¹) and biased directional retransmissions.

• Temporal thinning to 4-hr intervals to reduce autocorrelation; retain high-freq data for movement-state inference.

#### Step 2  – Define Biological Seasons

Adopt phenological cut-offs (DoY) refined by break-point analysis on migration speed plus NDVI derivative (dNDVI/dt). Draft seasons:

1. Calving (DoY 150–180)
2. Post-calving (181–210)
3. Summer (211–260)
4. Rut (261–300)
5. Early Winter (301–355)
6. Late Winter (356–149)

#### Step 3  – Resource- & Step-Selection Functions

**Integrated RSF + SSF structure (iRSF-iSSF):**

`logit(Use_it) = β0 + β1 SnowDepth_it + β2 NDVI_it + β3 Slope_i + β4 DistSeaIce_it + β5 DistHuman_i + b_individual + b_year + ε`

• Random intercepts for individual and year, nested within meta-population.

• Use Bayesian MCMC (Stan/brms), N_eff > 1,000, R̂ < 1.1.

**Movement kernel**: quantify selection along step length (L) and turning angle (θ) distributions:

`g(L,θ) = exp(β_L L + β_θ cos(θ))`

Combine RSF & movement kernel to produce integrated utilisation densities.

#### Step 4  – Climate-Change Integration (Dynamic Habitat Models)

• For each season, fit Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) for key covariates vs. year to derive climate-response curves.

• Predict habitat suitability for 2030, 2050, 2080 using CMIP6 downscaled covariates.

• Estimate *proportional retention* (PR) of current CH under each scenario: `PR = (Area_Hab_future ∩ Area_Hab_current) / Area_Hab_current`.

#### Step 5  – Indigenous Knowledge Fusion

• Represent IK polygons as prior weights in Bayesian model (`α = IK_weight`). Polygons with high consensus (>70 % informant overlap) receive α = 0.5 (equivalent to 50 GPS fixes).

• Validate model predictions against IK-identified important areas (spatial cross-validation).

#### Step 6  – Delineating Critical Habitat Polygons

1. Generate 95 % and 80 % utilisation kernels (UDs) for each season.
2. Clip UDs to environmental feasibility masks (snow depth < 45 cm for winter; NDVI > 0.15 summer; sea-ice >30 % conc. for crossings).
3. Merge seasonal CH into multi-season union; retain high-value aggregation (≥3 season overlap) as *key core habitat*.
4. Smooth polygons with 500 m tolerance; enforce minimum patch size 25 km².

#### Step 7  – Uncertainty & Sensitivity

• Bootstrapped 1,000 replicates of telemetry dataset; compute 90 % confidence bands on habitat extent.

• Monte-Carlo propagate GCM variance; derive SD maps of suitability.

• Provide CH polygons with 3-level confidence tiers (high, med, low).

#### Step 8  – Validation

• Hold-out 20 % telemetry for k-fold cross-validation; AUC >0.85, TSS >0.6 required.

• Compare predicted sea-ice corridor use with 2023–2024 non-modelled collar subset.

• Solicit IK verification workshops (Resolute Bay, Ulukhaktok) – adjust polygons where consensus indicates omission.

## 7  Activities Likely to Destroy Critical Habitat (ALTD)

1. Physical disturbance >2 km² causing snow compaction during late winter (e.g., seismic lines).

3. Mineral exploration camps producing persistent noise (>50 dB) in calving areas (May 15–June 15).
4. Infrastructure that increases wolf travel routes (ice roads) in rut habitats (Sept–Oct).

Mitigation hierarchy: avoid > minimise > restore > offset (last resort).

## 9  Emerging & Contrarian Ideas

1. **eDNA Snow-Layer Profiling**: Detect caribou DNA in stratified snow cores to refine winter-range extent independent of collars.
2. **Autonomous Saildrones**: Deploy in summer to map sea-ice roughness and validate corridor suitability in near-real time.
3. **AI-driven Behavioural State Segmentation**: Use deep-learning (HMM-Transformer hybrids) on accelerometer series to classify calving events, enabling finer calving CH boundaries.
4. **Offset Banking** *(speculative)*: Create an Arctic Habitat Bank where proponents fund long-term predator-exclosure experiments to compensate unavoidable CH disturbance.

---

## 10  Knowledge Gaps & Research Priorities

1. Predation-mediated habitat avoidance: integrate wolf GPS datasets; quantify risk layers.
2. Pathogen dynamics under warming: model *Brucella* spill-over and assign risk weights to CH polygons.
3. Cumulative-effects thresholds: what proportion of CH disturbance leads to demographic tipping (λ < 1)?
4. Sea-ice phenology thresholds: refine with PlanetScope daily cubes to 3 m.

## 11  Conclusion

This framework delivers a legally robust yet ecologically nuanced identification of Peary caribou critical habitat, meeting SARA’s immediate needs while supporting broader Arctic stewardship. Key strengths include multi-source data fusion, explicit climate-change integration, and a transparent uncertainty appraisal. Continued collaboration with Indigenous partners and the deployment of novel monitoring technologies will ensure the habitat delineations remain defensible and adaptive in the face of rapid Arctic change.
