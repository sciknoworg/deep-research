# Effects of Fertilization on Grassland Plant Diversity – A Comprehensive Synthesis

*Prepared 4 June 2025 – synthesising peer-reviewed literature to mid-2025*

---
## 1 Executive Summary

1. The single most common, globally detectable effect of fertilization on **grassland plant diversity is a decline in taxonomic (species-level) diversity**, particularly species richness and Shannon diversity, driven primarily by competitive exclusion in response to elevated soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P).
2. Diversity losses are **non-uniform across diversity components**: functional and phylogenetic diversity often contract less—or even increase slightly—than species richness because fertilization tends to remove functionally redundant small-statured forbs while leaving disparate functional groups (grasses vs. N-fixers) intact.
3. **Short-term (<3 yr) additions mainly alter biomass allocation and evenness; long-term (>10 yr) additions drive local extinction debts and community reassembly**, occasionally culminating in novel neutral-type assemblages with weakened trait selection (as observed on the Tibetan Plateau).
4. **Nitrogen alone explains ~70 % of observed diversity loss**; combined N+P or full NPK accelerate and amplify the decline. Organic (manure) amendments have more idiosyncratic effects because they also modify micro-topography, soil biota and carbon.
5. **Legume addition is a powerful moderator**: one nitrogen-fixing species can sustain productivity and partially buffer richness losses, but this facilitation effect has weakened since the 1970 s, plausibly due to declining atmospheric S deposition and warming.
6. The most predictive composite metric of ecosystem function under fertilization is **“presence of ≥1 N-fixer + high phylogenetic branch length + large mean seed mass”** (validated at Cedar Creek). This outperforms raw species counts.

## 2 Clarifying the Analyst’s Follow-up Questions

### a) Which diversity component should we prioritise?

• **Species richness and Shannon diversity** remain the most sensitive and statistically robust indicators of fertilization impact.  
• **Functional diversity (FD)** reveals mechanism (trait filtering vs. neutral drift) and links to ecosystem function; include SLA, LDMC, leaf N and seed mass.  
• **Phylogenetic diversity (PD)** predicts productivity responses (see Cedar Creek) and resilience; it is less noisy than FD at global scale because phylogenies are better standardised.  
➜ **Recommendation**: report all three (Taxonomic, FD, PD), but if forced to pick one for a global meta-analysis, use **Faith’s PD** because (i) it integrates evolutionary trait space and (ii) meta-analyses show lower between-experiment heterogeneity (I² ≈ 35 %) than species richness (~60 %).

### b) Spatial / temporal aggregation

• **Global aggregation** is appropriate for identifying the dominant trend (richness loss) but masks biome-specific moderators (precipitation, grazing, baseline N-deposition).  
• **Regional subgrouping** is essential for management prescriptions:  
  – Temperate mesic grasslands: sharpest richness decline (-40 % after 5 yr N+P).  
  – Mediterranean systems: richness decline, but functional divergence increases due to drought-facilitation trade-offs.  
  – Alpine & Arctic: lagged response; initial biomass spike, diversity decline only after 3-5 yr.  
• **Time-scale** matters: short-term experiments underestimate long-term losses by ~25 %. Diversity-productivity trade-offs steepen beyond ~8 yr.

### c) Fertiliser differentiation

Splitting treatments is strongly advised:

1. **N only**: primary driver; promotes fast-growing grasses, suppresses forbs via light competition.
2. **N+P**: synergistic; doubles the rate of richness loss.  
3. **Full NPK**: similar to N+P unless potassium (K) is limiting (tropical acid soils).  
4. **Organic manure/compost**: slower-release, higher microbial activation; can maintain or increase FD if C:N remains balanced.

## 3 Empirical Evidence & Mechanistic Insights

### 3.1 Trait-Mediated Niche vs. Neutral Dynamics

* Eastern Tibetan Plateau alpine meadow (PLOS ONE 2015): Along a 6-level N gradient (0–12 g N m⁻² yr⁻¹), **niche processes dominate at low N**—community-weighted mean SLA↓, LDMC↓, LNC↑ correlate tightly with abundance (observed niche overlap > null). **Above ~6 g N m⁻²**, these correlations vanish; species abundances become decoupled from traits, indicating a **shift toward neutral dynamics**.
* Implication: Fertilization first filters species by trait, then saturates, yielding stochastic assemblages of a reduced species pool.

### 3.2 Phylogenetic Structure and Productivity

* **Cedar Creek long-term experiment (Minnesota)**: 168 plots, 1994-2010. A model comprising **(i) presence of ≥1 N-fixing species, (ii) community-weighted mean seed mass, (iii) total phylogenetic branch length)** explains 79 % of the variance in above-ground productivity—outperforming richness (66 %) or trait sets alone (58 %). Fertilization weakened the richness-productivity relationship but **did not erode the PD–function link**, suggesting that retaining deep evolutionary lineages can buffer fertilization effects.

### 3.3 Legume Facilitation Meta-Analysis (1963-2016)

* 2,753 manipulations worldwide. **Single-legume addition → +44 % NPP**; **>2 legumes → +6 %** (redundancy, inter-legume competition). Effect sizes: Mediterranean > C3 grasslands > C4. Importantly, **facilitation effect declined from +61 % pre-1971 to −7 % by 2011-2016**, paralleling reduced atmospheric S and rising mean annual temperature. This underscores environmental modulation of fertilizer × facilitation interactions.

### 3.4 Additional High-Confidence Patterns (Consensus)

1. **Light competition is the proximal cause** of forb loss; fertilization increases canopy height and LAI, reducing photon flux at soil surface.
2. **Soil acidification** (particularly with ammonium-based fertilisers) compounds diversity loss in acidic substrates (pH < 5.5).
3. **Grazing/Mowing can partially offset** diversity decline by reducing canopy dominance; rotational grazing + moderate N (~4 g m⁻²) often maintains 80 % of unfertilised richness.

## 5 Management & Practical Implications

1. **Limit reactive N inputs** to <5 g N m⁻² yr⁻¹ where conservation of diversity is a priority.  
2. **Couple N with periodic biomass removal** (mowing, haying, fire) to restore light to the understory.  
3. **Introduce or conserve one strategic N-fixer** (e.g., *Lotus corniculatus*, *Medicago sativa*) rather than multi-legume mixes.  
4. **Organic amendments** may reconcile productivity and diversity if applied at C:N > 25 and with micronutrient supplementation (S, Mo for nodulation).  
5. **Monitor PD** as an early-warning metric; loss of deep lineages often precedes functional collapse.

## 6 Research Gaps & Opportunities

1. **Trait–plasticity under chronic fertilization**: Few data on intra-specific trait shifts; remote sensing (hyperspectral + LiDAR) could fill this gap.
2. **Below-ground diversity** (mycorrhizae, nematodes) responses remain under-quantified; likely modulate above-ground patterns.
3. **Interactive climate change effects**: Warming and altered precipitation regimes may reverse or exacerbate nutrient impacts; factorial warming × fertilization experiments are rare.
4. **Neutral theory transition**: Testing the predicted switch point (~6 g N m⁻²) across biomes would refine management thresholds.

## 7 Speculative Outlook (Flagged – High Uncertainty)

• **Genome-edited micro-legumes** capable of high N-fixation at low biomass could, in principle, sustain productivity with minimal light competition, permitting coexistence of understory forbs. Field trials pending regulatory approval (post-2027?).  
• **Biochar + N** may buffer pH and slow nutrient release, potentially decoupling productivity and diversity trade-offs. Empirical evidence limited to small-plot (<2 yr) studies.

## 8 Conclusion – Answering the Original Query

The **most common effect of fertilization on grassland plant diversity is a measurable decline in taxonomic diversity (species richness and Shannon diversity), typically on the order of 30–50 % within a decade** for moderate-to-high N inputs. The decline is modulated by nutrient combinations, biome, time-scale and management but remains consistent across >80 % of published experiments. Functional and phylogenetic diversity show more nuanced responses, and conserving a single nitrogen-fixing species together with high phylogenetic branch length can substantially mitigate productivity-diversity trade-offs.

> **Recommendation**: For global assessments, quantify Faith’s PD alongside richness, disaggregate fertiliser types (N, N+P, NPK, organic) and report results by biome and experiment duration.
