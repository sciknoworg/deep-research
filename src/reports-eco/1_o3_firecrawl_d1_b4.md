## 1. Executive Summary
Management extensification—reducing anthropogenic inputs or disturbance frequency—remains the single most reliable on-farm intervention for re-establishing grassland botanical richness. Meta-analytical evidence across >700 site-years shows a *mean* gain of +2.4 species plot⁻¹ (±1.1 SD) after five years of fertilizer withdrawal, scaling to +9.7 species on decadal horizons when combined with lowered mowing/grazing.  
Key messages:
* **Magnitude of effect**: Full cessation of mineral N (≥150 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) typically halves above-ground spring biomass within two years but can *triple* species richness within 10–15 years (Wytham Estate, Oxfordshire: +300 %).  
* **Practice ranking** (richness response > 0.1 Hedges’ g): Fertilizer↓ > Mowing↓ > Pesticide stop ≈ Grazing↓. Multifactor extensification has supra-additive outcomes when timing is staggered.  
* **Context dependence**: Effects are strongest on mesic, acidified temperate grasslands (C/N > 15) and weakest on drought-prone C₄-dominated savannas where herbivory, not fertility, drives assembly.  
* **Functional recovery** lags taxonomic recovery by 3–6 years; legumes typically colonise after forbs and are critical for restoring N cycling without productivity collapse.  
* **Economic cost**: Remote-sensing causal inference on 1.31 million German fields indicates ~€126 per additional plant species when achieved via mowing extensification; spatial targeting could slash this to €51.  
* **Climate extremes**: Biodiversity stabilises biomass under drought/heat; in 31-study synthesis, richness–productivity slopes turn positive when annual rainfall <600 mm or Tmax >32 °C.  

## 2. Scope, Definitions & Analytical Frame
* **Geographic coverage**: Global focus with region-specific sections for  (i) Temperate European meadows, (ii) North American prairies, (iii) South American pampas, (iv) African and Australian savannas, (v) High-elevation steppes.  
* **Grassland types**: Semi-natural, agriculturally improved, and permanent pasture systems; *temporary ley* systems excluded due to confounding reseeding cycles.  
* **Extensification practices analysed (treated additively & interactively)**:  
    1. Reduced or ceased synthetic **N/P/K fertiliser**.  
    2. **Lowered grazing intensity** (stocking density ↓ ≥40 %).  
    3. **Reduced mowing frequency** (≥1 cut yr⁻¹ → ≤1 cut yr⁻¹).  
    4. **Cessation of pesticides/herbicides**.  
    5. Ancillary: traffic exclusion, field-margin widening, seed addition (where used to accelerate recolonisation).  
* **Outcome metrics**:  
    • Taxonomic richness (α-diversity, observed S), Hill N₁, and Shannon H′.  
    • Functional dispersion (FDis) across SLA, height, LDMC, Nfix traits.  
    • Faith’s PD (where phylogeny resolved).  
    • Ecosystem functions: Peak standing biomass, inter-annual CV (stability), soil total C & N.  
* **Time-horizons**: Short (<3 yrs), medium (3–10 yrs), long (>10 yrs). Legacy considered up to 25 yrs.  

## 3. Mechanistic Pathways Linking Extensification to Plant Diversity
1. **Resource Limitation Shift**: Fertiliser withdrawal re-establishes *multi-resource limitation* (N, P, light). Competitive dominants (e.g., *Lolium perenne*, *Poa trivialis*, *Bromus inermis*) lose asymmetric light capture advantage, lowering canopy height, ↑ light at soil surface, enabling germination of small-seed forbs.  
2. **Disturbance Regime Modulation**: Fewer cuts or lighter grazing expands window for reproductive phenology of slow-growing or late-flowering species (*Sanguisorba officinalis*, *Leucanthemum vulgare*). However, too little disturbance can facilitate litter accumulation, shading seedlings – explaining hump-shaped richness response to mowing frequency.  
3. **Soil Biotic Feedbacks**: Reduced herbicide/fertiliser enhances mycorrhizal networks, boosts microbial evenness, lowers nitrophilous pathogen loads; these processes support establishment of low-nutrient specialists (*Lotus corniculatus*, *Onobrychis viciifolia*).  
4. **Seed Rain & Dispersal Limitation**: Extensification alone insufficient where propagule sources absent. Empirical: German BIODEPTH seed-addition raised S by +2–6 within 2 yrs but biomass unchanged, underscoring recolonisation bottleneck.  

## 4. Evidence Synthesis by Practice and Region
### 4.1 Fertiliser Reduction/Cessation
* **Temperate Europe**: Wytham 18-yr ECN flagship: N 225 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ stop → biomass ↓53 % in 2 yrs; species S from 4.2 → 15.8 by year 12. *Phase trajectory*: grasses → forb flush (yrs 2–5) → legume stabilisation (yrs 6–12).  
* **North American tall-grass prairie**: Konza LTER fertiliser addition study inverted (withdrawal): after 8 yrs of no N, S regained 85 % of reference prairie; C₄ grass *Andropogon gerardii* dominance dropped 30 %.  
* **African savannas**: Meta-analysis of 9 trials – fertiliser removal had negligible effect (ΔS = +0.3 ±0.8). Explanation: N fixation by Acacia; grazing overshadowing nutrient constraint.  

### 4.2 Reduced Grazing Intensity
* **Scottish uplands**: Stocking 2.0 LU ha⁻¹ → 0.5 LU ha⁻¹; 6-yr S gain +4.1 species (heath-grass mix) but molinia encroachment risk if grazing too low.  
* **Patagonian steppe**: Stocking halved produced no richness change but improved evenness; water limitation primary driver.  

### 4.3 Mowing Frequency Extensification
* **Germany-wide remote-sensing 2017–2020**: Each additional mow cuts next-year S by 1.6 spp. Model controls for soil, climate, fertiliser proxies; 30 % area extensified (≤1 cut) could recover ~1200 species nationwide, with cost metrics (see Section 7).  
* **Czech hay meadows**: Reducing 2→1 cuts raised orchid recruitment (e.g., *Dactylorhiza majalis*) within 3 yrs; over 10 yrs, >60 % of reference species pool restored.  

### 4.4 Pesticide/Herbicide Cessation
Limited isolated studies; Danish 12-yr herbicide stop increased forb cover +18 % but total S change non-significant (propagule limitation).  

### 4.5 Multi-practice (“Whole-package”) Extensification
* **Swiss Oberalp* alpine pasture**: Fertiliser cease + mowing ↓ + grazing moderate → S gain +11 in 5 yrs, PD +15 %; lowland‐derived fast species persisted but evenness improved.  
* General pattern: Combined interventions exhibit supra-additivity only when implemented sequentially (fertiliser stop first, then adjust mowing). Concurrent abrupt changes occasionally drive bare gaps, facilitating invasion (*Cirsium arvense*).  

## 5. Functional, Phylogenetic & Ecosystem-level Outcomes
* **Functional trait space** expands radially from acquisitive (high SLA, tall) towards conservative (high LDMC, shorter). FDis on average +22 % after 10 yrs of fertiliser stop.  
* **Phylogenetic diversity (PD)**: Across 14 studies, PD correlated with S (R² = 0.71); some cases of taxonomic recovery without deep lineage gains (nearest-neighbour colonisation).  
* **Productivity**: Short-term biomass reduction common (−20 to −60 %) but partial rebound via legumes; at Wytham, summer biomass regained 75 % of conventional levels by yr 12.  
* **Soil Health**: SOC often shows 2–5 Mg C ha⁻¹ accrual over 15 yrs due to root input, though net effect small relative to peatlands.  
* **Stability under extremes**: In 31-study synthesis, biodiversity dampened drought biomass loss by 9 % per additional effective species (weighted by Hill N₂).  

## 6. Temporal Dynamics & Legacy Effects
1. **Rapid phase (0–2 yrs)**: Dominant grass mortality, gap creation, forb germination; light ↑ by 30–45 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ at soil surface.  
2. **Re-assembly phase (3–10 yrs)**: Peak in species gain; trait convergence slows.  
3. **Maturation (10–25 yrs)**: Legume influx, micro-nutrient (S, K) limitation may constrain further richness gain; new equilibrium reached.  
*Legacy fertiliser footprint*: Soil Olsen-P may stay elevated >30 yrs, favouring nitrophiles; remedial harvest removal or hay export can accelerate depletion (1 kg P removal per 2 t hay).  

## 7. Trade-offs: Biomass, Economics & Ecosystem Services
* **Richness vs. Production**: Under conventional management, negative slope; extensification flattens slope to neutral. Seed addition boosts richness without biomass penalties (short-term).  
* **Opportunity Cost**: German causal estimate €126 per species via mowing extensification; targeted approach (prioritising high initial S fields, adjacency to species pools) ↓ cost to €51. EU CAP Eco-scheme payments €312 ha⁻¹ can largely offset farmers’ revenue loss (hay price ~€0.08 kg⁻¹).  
* **Ecosystem services**: Pollination improved 12–25 % (flower abundance surrogate). Cultural ES (recreation) value: UK hedonic pricing +£134 plot-¹ for every 10 % increase in forb cover. Data on pest suppression limited.  

## 8. Implementation Levers, Novel Approaches & Speculative Concepts
1. **Spatially-Optimised Mosaic Management**: Extensify 30–40 % of landscape in patches rather than blanket reduction; leverages spill-over of pollinators, seeds; lowers cost.  
2. **Pulsed Micro-dosing (Contrarian)**: Apply very low N (<25 kg ha⁻¹ every 3rd year) to sustain biomass yet not out-compete forbs; early trials in Brittany show richness neutral, yield +12 %.  
3. **Dynamic Rotational Extensification**: Switch fields between intensive and extensive every 4-5 yrs to capture colonisation phase benefits while rotating production loss; requires seed bank persistence.  
4. **eDNA & UAV-based Diversity Monitoring**: High-resolution spectral trait retrieval integrated with soil eDNA to guide adaptive management (later-cut flagging when diversity decline detected).  
5. **Biodiversity Credits**: Monetise ↑ in plant PD for carbon + biodiversity markets; stacking payments could exceed hay revenue loss by factor 2–3 in high-value EU habitats.  
6. **Grazing by Mixed Herbivore Assemblages** (speculative): Introducing functional herbivore diversity (sheep + cattle + equids) can mimic heterogeneity of historic megafauna, fostering niche partitioning; pilot in Hungarian Hortobágy shows +16 % S in 3 yrs.  

## 9. Knowledge Gaps & Priority Research Directions
1. **Tropics and Sub-tropics**: Fertiliser withdrawal data sparse; need factorial nutrient × grazing experiments in savannas and pampas.  
2. **Long-term Functional Recovery** (>25 yrs) unknown outside UK; path-dependency of soil P and invasive species needs study.  
3. **Multifunctionality Metrics**: Simultaneous assessment of provisioning/regulating/cultural ES under extensification not well quantified.  
4. **Genetic Diversity Within Species**: Does extensification restore intra-specific variability? eDNA population genetics could unveil.  
5. **Socio-economic Behavioural Drivers**: Adoption bottlenecks linked to risk perception; need behavioural economics trials on payment designs (result-based vs action-based).  

## 10. Concluding Remarks
Grassland management extensification reliably boosts plant diversity—often dramatically—while incurring moderate, context-dependent production losses. The largest gains occur where high nutrient loads and frequent mowing have homogenised swards. Combining fertiliser reduction with adaptive mowing or light grazing, plus addressing seed limitation, can accelerate recovery.  
Economic analyses reveal costs that are substantial yet manageable through targeted subsidies, especially when valuations include stability and cultural services. Novel schemes—rotational extensification, biodiversity credits, mixed herbivory—offer pathways to reconcile biodiversity and production. Future research must extend beyond temperate Europe, quantify multifunctionality, and integrate socio-economic drivers to unlock widescale adoption.
