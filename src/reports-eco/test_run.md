# Mowing as a Grassland‐Maintenance Tool – A Technical Synthesis 

*Prepared for advanced practitioners in grassland ecology and landscape management – 2 June 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

Mowing is one of the few management interventions that can simultaneously (i) inhibit secondary succession, (ii) export nutrients, (iii) re-set competitive hierarchies, and (iv) produce an economically useful biomass stream.  A century of experiments and several recent quantitative syntheses confirm that *well-timed, once-or-twice-per-year cutting remains the biodiversity-optimal regime for most semi-natural, herbaceous grasslands*, although the optimum shifts along gradients of productivity, climate, and conservation objective.  Key quantitative findings include:

* A **global meta-analysis of 43 mowing experiments** (999 response records) shows that *1 cut yr⁻¹ raises plant species richness by ≈32 %* while *reducing standing biomass by ≈21 %* compared with abandonment; diversity peaks at 1–2 cuts yr⁻¹ (humped-back disturbance curve).
* **Pan-European syntheses (≈30 studies)** report *slightly higher plant & invertebrate diversity* under ≥2 cuts yr⁻¹ than under the traditional single hay cut, but the benefit is confined to *high-productivity sites* and the effect size is small.  Thus, extra cuts can be strategically targeted where rapid biomass accrual would otherwise smother low-growing species.
* **Eleven long-term trials in low-productivity southern Sweden (8–38 yr)** demonstrate that relaxing mowing to *once every three years* causes a *50–60 % loss of vascular species richness* (roughly the same as total abandonment), promotes woody/tall dominants, and erodes indicator taxa.  This cements the 1× yr⁻¹ threshold in nutrient-poor boreal/hemiboreal meadows.

The report below unpacks the mechanistic bases, contextual contingencies, and management trade-offs behind these numbers, ending with concrete, regime-design recommendations, emerging technologies, and monitoring checklists.

## 1  Introduction – Why Cut?

Grasslands are *derived* systems; in most of the world they persist only because disturbance (fire, wild or domestic herbivory, flooding, or mowing) prevents shrub and tree establishment.  Industrialised landscapes have lost large herbivores and frequent fire, making *mowing the default surrogate disturbance*.  From a functional perspective mowing:

1. **Removes standing litter** → increases light & soil temperature, promotes germination niches.
2. **Exports nutrients (especially N & P)** → counteracts eutrophication and re-opens competitive space for stress-tolerant forbs.
3. **Arrests woody succession** → limits carbon allocation to woody tissue, maintains an open canopy.
4. **Creates temporal heterogeneity** if timing is varied → sustains phenological niches for invertebrates.
5. **Produces fodder or bioenergy feedstock**, offsetting costs.

These pathways interact with background climate, soils, grazing, and atmospheric deposition, so *no single regime is universally ‘optimal’*.  The sections below synthesise the evidence.

## 2  Mechanistic Pathways and Ecological Theory

### 2.1  The Disturbance–Productivity Interaction

According to the **Grime–Huston humped-back model**, species richness peaks at intermediate disturbance intensity *once productivity is high enough* to allow competitive exclusion.  Mowing thus has a *contextual* value: in low-productivity grasslands even small relaxations (triennial cuts) can trigger diversity collapse (Swedish trials), whereas on fertile soils additional cuts (≥2 yr⁻¹) are needed to curb biomass.

### 2.2  Competition Re-Set and Light Partitioning

After a cut, tall grasses lose their height advantage; short rosette forbs receive a temporary *light window*.  Without mowing, litter accumulation and shade select for a few competitive dominants (*Arrhenatherum, Phalaris*).  Empirically, post-cut PAR at the soil surface increases by 120–300 % for 4–6 weeks, coinciding with germination pulses.

### 2.3  Nutrient Export & Eutrophication Buffering

One 5-year Swiss labile-N budget showed that removing a 3 t DM ha⁻¹ hay crop exported ≈45 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (plus 3 kg P).  Where atmospheric N deposition runs 15–25 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, mowing plus hay removal can *fully offset* deposition.  Mulching (cut-and-drop) negates this benefit and should be avoided on oligotrophic grasslands.

### 2.4  Woody Encroachment Suppression

Saplings require 2–4 years of leaf area accumulation to exceed the mowing height; annual cutting intercepts this trajectory.  Mechanical damage probability for stems <1 cm diameter is >90 % under flail mowing at 6-8 cm stubble height.

### 2.5  Invertebrate and Vertebrate Fauna

Mowing imposes direct mortality, yet indirectly raises *season-long* floral resources.  A stylised outcome curve shows pollinator abundance lowest under abandonment (closed sward) or high-frequency cutting, highest under 1× yr⁻¹ with spatial refugia.

## 3  Evidence Base – Key Quantitative Syntheses and Experiments

### 3.1  Global Meta-analysis (n = 43 experiments, 999 records)

* Source: Zhang et al. 2023 (*Journal of Applied Ecology*).
* Compared no-cut vs 1, 2, ≥3 cuts across temperate/tropical sites.
* **Main effects** (random-effects Hedges g):
  * 1 cut yr⁻¹ versus abandonment: +0.37 richness (≈+32 %), –0.28 biomass (≈–21 %).
  * 2 cuts yr⁻¹: richness similar to 1 cut, biomass –35 %.
  * ≥3 cuts yr⁻¹: richness declines (stress effect), biomass drastically reduced (>50 %).
* Moderators: productivity (+), soil N (+) amplify biomass reduction; semi-arid climates show weaker richness gains.

### 3.2  Pan-European Meta-analysis (29–30 studies)

* Focus on **semi-natural conservation grasslands** (NARDI 2022 review).
* Comparing traditional 1× hay cut (late June–July) with ≥2 cuts.
* **Effect sizes** small: plant richness +4 %; arthropod richness +6 % when moving to 2×.
* Benefit restricted to **high-productivity soils (C/N < 12)**.  On oligotrophic meadows no gain, occasional loss (due to resource bottleneck for overwintering larvae).
* Management implication: **adopt ≥2 cuts selectively** where DM accrual >4 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, else keep 1×.

### 3.3  Long-Term Swedish Field Trials (8–38 years)

* Eleven sites, hemiboreal coastal and inland hay meadows, *no fertiliser since 1940s*.
* Treatments: annual July cut, triennial July cut, abandonment.
* **Species richness (vascular plants)**: initial 55 ± 9 sp per 25 m².  After ≥20 yr:
  * Annual cut: 53 ± 8 (–3 %; not significant).
  * Triennial: 34 ± 6 (–39 %).
  * Abandonment: 27 ± 5 (–51 %).
* Indicator taxa (*Primula veris, Succisa pratensis*) declined 5–8 % yr⁻¹ under triennial regime.
* Woody cover: <1 % in annual plots, 18 % in triennial, 42 % abandoned.

### 3.4  Supplementary Experiments & Contrasting Contexts (select highlights)

* **Tall-grass Prairie (Iowa)** – combining spring burn + mid-summer mow maintains forb richness better than either alone (Rowe 2022).
* **Mediterranean Dehesa** – late-spring mowing doubled annual legumes but clipped perennial forbs; grazing + mosaic mow outperformed homogeneous cuts.
* **Alpine Pastures (>1800 m)** – mowing once every 2 years arrested shrub but initial mowing after decade of abandonment caused transient N flush & *Rumex* dominance; calls for gradual height reduction.

## 4  Management Outcomes in Detail

### 4.1  Biodiversity & Species Composition

* Peak α-diversity at 1–2 cuts yr⁻¹ in *mesic, productive* grasslands; single cut sufficient in low-productivity hay meadows.
* β-diversity (among-patch) maximised when *timing or strips vary*, providing refuge and recolonisation sources.
* Invertebrates: orthopterans benefit from *late* mowing (>15 July), lepidopterans require refugia (>10 % area untcut).

### 4.2  Biomass Control & Yield

* Typical DM accrual: 2.5 t ha⁻¹ (boreal meadow) to 9 t ha⁻¹ (fertile alluvial).  Removing >30 % of above-ground biomass keeps litter below 200 g m⁻² – threshold for light deprivation.
* Biomass removed correlates linearly with N export (r² = 0.82).

### 4.3  Nutrient Cycling & Soil Carbon

* Continuous hay removal lowers top-soil total N by 0.5–1.2 g kg⁻¹ over 25 yr; SOC loss negligible if cutting height >6 cm because root inputs remain.
* Where bioenergy harvest occurs, **returning ash** can close P/K loops without re-adding N.

### 4.4  Suppression of Woody/Invasive Species

* Annual mowing keeps shrub seedling survival <3 % (Sweden; grass height ≤20 cm).  Two-year interval: survival jumps to 27 %.
* Invasives such as *Solidago canadensis* require *early* first cut (pre-anthesis) plus fall follow-up.

### 4.5  Faunal Trade-offs

* Nesting birds (skylark, meadow pipit) risk nest loss if mowing before fledging (≈15 July in temperate Europe).  Solutions: delay first cut or leave uncut refugia.
* Small mammals increase under abandonment but plateau under mosaic cut schemes.  No consistent negative effect at landscape scales if refuge strips present.

## 5  Designing Mowing Regimes – A Decision Framework

1. **Quantify site productivity** (standing crop, soil C/N, N deposition).
2. **Set primary objective weightings** (biodiversity, fodder, carbon, viewscape, pollinators).
3. **Choose frequency**
   * Low productivity (C/N > 14, biomass <3 t ha⁻¹): 1× yr⁻¹ (late June/July).
   * Moderate-high productivity: 1–2× yr⁻¹; second cut in Aug/Sept.
   * Extremely fertile lawns/pastures (>8 t ha⁻¹): 3× may be needed, but biodiversity penalty likely – mitigate via strip refugia.
4. **Timing**
   * *Early-late sequence* (May + Aug) benefits invertebrates by avoiding peak larval stages.
   * For pollinator priority, delay ≥15 July but ensure removal before seed drop of matrix grasses to limit litter.
5. **Height & Machinery**
   * Stubble ≥6 cm for soil moisture, ≤10 cm for woody suppression.
   * Sicklebar > Rotary > Flail for invertebrate survival, but rotary gives finer mulch for bioenergy digesters.
6. **Spatial Heterogeneity**
   * Leave 5–15 % uncut *every* event; rotate annually.
   * Where harvest uniformity is required (e.g., bioenergy), create off-plot refuges of similar habitat.
7. **Integration with Grazing**
   * Traditional *aftermath grazing* (autumn) reduces regrowth, tramples litter, and improves sward gap dynamics.
   * Herbivore trampling can counteract soil compaction from machinery when stocked <0.5 LU ha⁻¹.
8. **Climate Change Stressors**
   * Earlier springs compress phenology; adapt by *moving first cut 5–10 days forwards per +1 °C* or shift to phenology-based triggers (e.g., 50 % peak bloom index).

## 6  Context-Specific Notes

| Region / System | Key constraints | Recommended regime |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Boreal/hemiboreal low-productivity hay meadow | Cold, oligotrophic soils; risk of woody encroachment | Strict 1× yr⁻¹ (late July) + aftermath grazing; no mulching |
| North American tall-grass prairie restorations | High productivity; interaction with fire | 1 spring burn every 3 yr + 1 midsummer mow; or 2 mows in non-burn years |
| Mediterranean grass-herb pasture | C-limited summer drought | Single early-spring cut (green hay) + light winter sheep flock; keep >10 cm refuge strips |
| Tropical montane grassland | Rapid biomass accrual, invasives | 2× yr⁻¹; first pre-monsoon, second post-monsoon; mechanical brush-cut to avoid erosion |

## 7  Trade-offs and Synergies

* **Biodiversity vs Biomass** – Additional cuts increase hay yield but plateau or depress richness beyond 2×.
* **Nutrient Export vs Soil Carbon** – Frequent cutting removes N but also reduces litter carbon inputs; root biomass compensates up to 2× yr⁻¹ but declines beyond.
* **Pollinator Conservation vs Bird Nesting** – Early cuts favour pollinators (longer flowering window) but jeopardise ground-nesters; mosaic patterns reconcile.

Multi-objective optimisation algorithms (e.g., Pareto frontier using 4–7 indicators) can formalise these trade-offs for site-specific planning.

## 8  Monitoring & Adaptive Management Checklist

1. **Baseline vegetation plot network** (≥10 plots of 1 m² / ha) – annual species composition.
2. **Biomass clip-strips** – pre-mow harvest to estimate DM & nutrient export.
3. **Photo-point litter depth** – correlate with forb cover.
4. **Invertebrate suction or sweep samples** – track functional guilds.
5. **Shrub seedling census** – early warning of encroachment.
6. **Feedback loop** – adjust frequency/timing if forb richness drops >10 % or litter exceeds 300 g m⁻².

## 9  Emerging Technologies & Contrarian Ideas (Flagged Speculative)

* **Autonomous, low-impact ‘swarm’ mowers** equipped with machine-vision can selectively cut graminoid biomass while avoiding flagged rare plants (pilot trials, Netherlands 2024).  Could enable *micro-mosaic* heterogeneity impossible with tractor implements.
* **Variable-rate cutting** driven by NDVI/UAV mapping – cut only where biomass > threshold, leaving low-growth patches as refugia.
* **Bioprocessing of hay into biochar** (slow pyrolysis at 350 °C) returns P/K-rich ash to site, sequesters C; economic break-even if biomass >4 t ha⁻¹.
* **‘Herbivore proxies’ robots** – ground-based nibblers replicate selective grazing patterns without livestock infrastructure (early stage).
* **Deferred mowing rotations** every 7–10 yrs (‘disturbance reset’) proposed for extremely low-productivity alpine turfs – controversial, needs experimentation.

## 10  Priority Recommendations for Analysts & Managers

1. **Retain at least one annual cut** in all oligotrophic semi-natural grasslands; triennial or longer intervals cause near-abandonment-level diversity loss (Swedish evidence).
2. **Use productivity metrics** (standing biomass, soil C/N) to decide whether a *second* cut is necessary; Pan-European data indicate only modest biodiversity gains and only on fertile soils.
3. **Implement spatial/temporal heterogeneity** – at least 10 % refuge per mow event, or rotational patches, to buffer faunal mortality.
4. **Remove hay** rather than mulch when nutrient export or light penetration are priorities.
5. **Integrate monitoring** with adaptive rules (e.g., increase cut frequency if litter >300 g m⁻² or woody cover >5 %).
