# Biodiversity and Health: An Integrated Technical Assessment

*Prepared for an expert audience – June 2025*

---

## 1  Executive Summary

Biodiversity underpins every dimension of planetary, animal and human health. Empirical and modelling studies conducted during the last decade paint a complex, nonlinear picture: biodiversity erosion amplifies infectious-disease emergence, erodes nutritional security, degrades mental-health–supporting ecosystem services and undermines socio-economic resilience. Yet the magnitude, direction, and economic valuation of these links vary according to scale (macro-ecosystem vs. microbiome), taxonomic group, geographic context, and even statistical treatment of biodiversity indicators.

Key topline findings derived from the compiled research corpus include:

1. **Runaway loss of vertebrate biomass.** Diversity-weighted Living Planet Index (LPI) calculations reveal a 58 % decline in monitored vertebrate abundance since 1970 (freshwater –81 %, marine –36 %, terrestrial –38 %), roughly triple the drop inferred from the unweighted LPI that dominated policy dialogues until 2020. Scenario modelling projects an additional 18–35 % decline for terrestrial carnivores & ungulates by 2050 if land-use and climate trends persist.
2. **Extinction velocity.** Current estimates approach ≈50,000 species yr⁻¹ (~137 day⁻¹). Only ~2 million of Earth’s ~15 million species are formally described, perpetuating deep uncertainty in biotic baselines and health impact forecasting.
3. **Pathogen spill-over risk.** A 2023 ILRI/CGIAR systematic review confirms that agricultural intensification coupled with ecological disruption consistently elevates zoonotic risk. Yet integrative modelling that combines ecological, economic, and sociological drivers remains rare, limiting predictive power and One Health intervention design.
4. **Indicator artefacts.** The choice of biodiversity proxy can flip sign and significance when correlated with national health metrics: Maastricht University’s cross-country analysis even found a *positive* association between log(% threatened species) and life expectancy, underscoring ecological-fallacy pitfalls.
5. **Evidence gaps.** High-impact driver interactions—especially land-use × climate change—are severely under-studied (text-mining of >44k articles), jeopardising evidence-based progress toward CBD Target 12 and SDG 3 (health) & 15 (life on land).
6. **Policy levers.** ‘Sustainable Development’ land-use/energy scenarios could stabilise or reverse many projected biodiversity declines, with cascading health co-benefits. Conversely, Business-as-Usual trajectories ensure widespread non-achievement of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework goals.

The remainder of this report unpacks mechanistic pathways, quantitative evidence, methodological caveats, and forward-looking intervention options.

## 2  Conceptual Pathways Linking Biodiversity and Health

### 2.1  Infectious Disease Dynamics

• **Dilution vs. Amplification:** Diverse host communities can ‘dilute’ pathogen transmission (e.g., Lyme disease in the northeastern USA) by inserting non-competent hosts, but under certain conditions added species serve as amplification hosts (e.g., West Nile virus). The net sign is context-dependent, demanding mechanistic modelling rather than generic heuristics.

• **Reservoir Disruption:** Habitat fragmentation often concentrates highly competent rodent reservoirs, elevating hantavirus and arenavirus prevalence.

• **Vector Regulatory Services:** Predator diversity (bats, odonates, anopheline-feeding fishes) suppresses disease vectors, but these guilds are among the first casualties of pesticide use and deforestation.

• **Pathogen Pollution:** Species introductions and livestock trade redistribute microbes across biogeographic filters. Biodiversity loss may thus *increase* alien pathogen establishment by freeing niche space.

### 2.2  Nutrition & Food Security

• **Wild Harvest & Micronutrients:** Small-scale fisheries and bushmeat hunting supply >20 % of animal protein in some low-income regions; taxon-specific extirpations translate directly into micronutrient deficits (Fe, Zn, DHA).

• **Pollination Stability:** Crops requiring biotic pollination represent ≈35 % of global food production by volume but ≈75 % by nutrient diversity. Wild bee richness buffers yield variance under climate extremes.

• **Genetic Reservoirs:** Agro-biodiversity (landraces, wild relatives) supplies traits for heat, salinity and pest resistance—central for climate-adapted breeding.

### 2.3  Mental Health & Cultural Services

Empirical work (urban green space meta-analysis, n≈290 studies) reveals dose-dependent reductions in depression and all-cause mortality for exposure to biodiverse green/blue spaces versus monoculture lawns. Mechanisms include biophilic stress recovery, microbiome priming (the ‘old friends’ hypothesis), and enhanced physical activity.

### 2.4  One Health & Eco-Health Integration

UCL’s 2016 framework positions biodiversity not as a co-benefit but as a core lever: degrading ecosystems erodes regulating services → amplifies spill-over → widens health inequities. A systems approach couples environmental, animal, and human datasets into unified early-warning and intervention strategies.

## 3  Macro-Scale Biodiversity Evidence

### 3.1  Global Trends & Scenario Modelling

| Scenario | ΔLPI (Carnivores + Ungulates) 2020→2050 | ΔIUCN Extinction Risk | CBD Target 12 Likely? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Business-as-Usual (SSP2-RCP6.0) | –18 to –35 % | +8 – 23 % species shift to higher risk | No |
| Sustainable Development (SSP1-RCP2.6 with aggressive restoration) | 0 to +12 % | –4 – 9 % | Potentially |

Note: Utrecht & Queensland groups (2022) utilised a covariance-weighted LPI to constrain uncertainty inflation.

### 3.2  Reliability of the Living Planet Index

• **Error Propagation:** Observational heteroskedasticity combined with positive covariance amongst population time-series widens CIs as t→1970 baseline. Neglecting covariance thus underestimates risk of false optimism.

• **Taxonomic Bias Correction:** Diversity-weighting lifts under-represented taxa (amphibians, freshwater fishes) and yields a steeper decline (–58 % vs. –20 %). Policy dashboards that ignore this bias may mis-allocate conservation funds to charismatic but relatively stable groups.

### 3.3  Spatial Heterogeneity & Hotspots

Freshwater biomes exhibit collapse (–81 %) driven by flow alteration and invasive species. These same regions (e.g., Lower Mekong, Amazon floodplain) act as pathogen hotspot incubators (leptospirosis, opisthorchiasis) and nutritional safety nets via fisheries—highlighting conflict between hydropower development and health resilience.

### 3.4  Driver Alignment Gap

Text-mining of >44k papers (UQ 2023) shows land-use × climate interaction—ranked #1 for projected biodiversity loss—ranks only 15th by research attention, indicating a strategic funding gap hampering anticipatory mitigation.

## 4  Micro-Scale Biodiversity Evidence

### 4.1  Human Gut Microbiome Diversity

Higher alpha-diversity associates with lowered incidence of metabolic syndrome, colorectal cancer and even COVID-19 severity (meta-RR≈0.65). Diet diversity and environmental microbial inputs (soil contact, fermented foods) are major determinants.

### 4.2  Environmental Microbiomes & Immune Priming

Studies on Finnish daycare ‘rewilding’—replacing asphalt with forest floor—boosted children’s skin and gut microbiota within 28 days, up-regulated IL-10, and lowered TNF-α. Implication: small-scale biodiversity interventions can influence immune maturation.

### 4.3  Pathogen Pollution & Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)

Diverse soil microbial communities can out-compete resistant strains, yet antibiotic runoff selects for resistant gene reservoirs. Biodiversity thus modulates AMR ecology via competitive exclusion and horizontal gene transfer network connectivity.

---

## 5  Quantitative Epidemiological & Economic Evidence

### 5.1  Meta-Analytical Snapshots

• **ILRI/CGIAR (2023)**—41 studies, pooled OR for zoonotic spill-over in high-intensity livestock landscapes vs. low-intensity = 1.76 (95 % CI 1.43–2.12).

• **University of Queensland (2020)**—Biodiversity loss correlated with 9 % higher diarrhoeal disease burden per 10 % forest-cover decline (meta-regression over 22 countries, 2000-2015).

• **Economic Valuation:** Pollination-dependent nutrient production lost due to pollinator decline valued at $200–500 bn yr⁻¹; mental-health cost savings from urban biodiversity in EU estimated at €7.5 bn yr⁻¹ (avoided productivity loss).

### 5.2  Counter-intuitive Correlations

Maastricht study found a *positive* cross-national correlation between threatened-species proportion and life expectancy. Explanation: GDP confounding and indicator mismatch. Lesson: unit of analysis matters; ecological processes operate at landscape / biome scale, not national averages.

---

## 6  Methodological Caveats & Data Gaps

1. **Undescribed Species Blind Spot:** Extinction estimates rely on macroecological scaling, introducing ±0.5 order-of-magnitude uncertainty.
2. **Publication Bias:** Health–biodiversity studies often favour significant results (Egger’s test p<0.05), inflating perceived effect sizes.
3. **Indicator Ambiguity:** Forest cover ≠ habitat quality; percent threatened species ≠ recent trend.
4. **Temporal Mismatch:** Health datasets (annual) vs. biodiversity (multi-year). Misaligned temporal resolution blurs causal inference.
5. **Socio-economic Modifiers:** Poverty, healthcare access, and governance mediate biological links but are infrequently modelled jointly.

## 7  Policy & Intervention Implications

### 7.1  Conservation as Public Health Infrastructure

• **Protect High-Regulating Ecosystems:** Wetlands, mangroves and intact forests deliver both disease buffering and nutrition (fisheries, NTFPs).

• **Biodiversity-Integrated One Health Surveillance:** Couple eDNA monitoring of wildlife with hospital sentinel data to detect cross-species pathogen traffic in real-time.

### 7.2  Land-Use Planning

• **Agro-ecological Matrix:** Habitat corridors within agricultural mosaics retain predator guilds controlling rodent and mosquito vectors.

• **Sustainable Development Scenario Implementation:** Combines reduced meat consumption, yield-gap closure, and reforestation; modelling shows potential LPI stabilisation by 2030 and net gains by 2050.

### 7.3  Urban Design

• **Biodiverse Green/Blue Networks:** Prioritise taxon-rich plantings, heterogeneous water bodies; deliver mental-health dividends and microbiome enrichment.

### 7.4  Economic Instruments

• **Biodiversity Credit Markets (speculative):** Price in avoided health costs to raise credit value; could out-compete carbon-only offsets.

• **Pandemic Bonds 2.0:** Incorporate ecological risk triggers (e.g., land-use change rates) into payout mechanisms.

---

## 8  Frontier & Contrarian Ideas (Flagged as Speculative)

1. **Rewilding for Disease Suppression:** Re-introducing apex predators to regulate reservoir populations—e.g., wolves reducing Lyme disease risk via red-fox trophic cascade.
2. **Synthetic Bio-Indicators:** CRISPR-based sentinel microbes that fluoresce in presence of zoonotic viruses—enabling pasture-level risk alerts.
3. **Microbiome Engineering:** Probiotic environmental sprays to restore soil/gut diversity post-antibiotic or pesticide exposure.
4. **Satellite-driven Biodiversity Now-casts:** Real-time fusion of hyperspectral & SAR data with AI to forecast spill-over hotspots weeks in advance.

---

## 9  Priority Research Directions

1. **Driver Interaction Experiments:** Factorial manipulations of land-use and climate variables, targeting understudied but high-impact combinations identified in text-mining gap analysis.
2. **Bayesian Network Meta-Synthesis:** Leverage the Pascual et al. (2016) Figshare corpus (434 studies) to map probabilistic chains from biodiversity alterations through ecosystem functions/services to specific health outcomes.
3. **Covariance-Weighted Monitoring:** Universal adoption of the improved LPI computation to minimise mis-allocation of resources.
4. **Socio-Ecological System Modelling:** Embed economic and governance variables within biodiversity–health simulations to generate actionable policy scenarios.
5. **Undersampled Taxa & Regions:** Amplify monitoring in freshwater systems and the Global South to correct geographic and taxonomic bias.

## 10  Conclusions

The cumulative evidence leaves little doubt: safeguarding and restoring biodiversity is tantamount to preventive medicine at planetary scale. Yet methodological pitfalls, indicator artefacts and research-effort misalignment currently blunt policy traction. By adopting integrative analytical frameworks, correcting statistical biases, and investing in high-impact but neglected driver interactions, the scientific and policy community can unlock co-benefits for climate stability, food security, mental health and pandemic prevention. A ‘Sustainable Development’ trajectory—paired with One Health integration and innovative economic instruments—remains the most robust pathway to halt the intertwined crises of biodiversity loss and global health insecurity.
