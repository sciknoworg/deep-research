# Final Report: Using Herbaria Specimens to Study the Effects of Climate Change

## Introduction

Herbaria specimens represent a vast and underutilized archive for understanding historical and contemporary ecological and evolutionary dynamics. They span centuries—from the 16th century to the present—and offer a comprehensive record of plant phenology, distribution, and morphology. This report provides a detailed synthesis of current research methods, technological advancements, challenges, and future directions for using herbaria specimens to study climate change impacts. Although herbaria were traditionally used for taxonomic and floristic studies, recent innovations have dramatically expanded their application to climate change research, allowing for detailed reconstructions of phenological shifts and species distribution changes over time.

## Historical Context and the Value of Herbaria in Climate Change Research

Herbaria offer a uniquely long-term archive, with over 350 million specimens housed across approximately 3000 institutions worldwide. These records include detailed metadata such as collection dates, locations, and collector identities. Such breadth and depth are particularly valuable for examining the impacts of global environmental drivers—including climate change, pollution, habitat loss, and biological invasions—across extensive temporal and geographical scales.

Over the past decades, seminal studies have shown that herbaria are robust proxies for inferring biological responses. For example, research from New England and Massachusetts has demonstrated that an increase of 1°C in mean spring temperature can result in an advance of flowering phenology by 2–3 days. These findings illustrate the precision with which phenological events captured in herbaria can be linked to climatic variables.

## Integrating Herbaria Data with Contemporary Methods

### Digitization and Data Extraction

One of the most significant recent advances in herbarium-based research is the mass digitization of specimens. Platforms such as GBIF and iDigBio have catalogued millions of specimens, making detailed data easily accessible. Enhanced digitization efforts, incorporating Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and machine learning methods (e.g., Mask R‐CNN, convolutional neural networks), allow researchers to extract high-resolution phenological, morphological, and even genetic information from specimen images. These approaches not only enable automated data extraction at scale but also reduce the human error associated with manual curation.

### Genomics and Next-Generation Sequencing

Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and protocols designed for ancient or degraded DNA (e.g., PTB-DTT extraction in clean-room conditions) have allowed the extraction of genetic material from herbarium specimens. The integration of genomic data with phenological and morphological information facilitates evolutionary studies and helps elucidate the genetic basis for observed responses to climate change. Such methods are especially valuable in disentangling adaptive genetic changes from phenotypic plasticity.

### Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing

High-resolution GIS-based climate data extraction is now a cornerstone of climate impact studies using herbaria. By coupling specimen metadata—such as GPS coordinates, where available—with contemporary climate datasets (e.g., PRISM, NOAA’s GHCNM), researchers can perform sophisticated analyses of species distributions and phenological trends. This spatial contextualization is critical for understanding localized microclimatic effects as well as broader continental shifts.

### Integration with Citizen Science and Field Observations

Recent studies illustrate that robust analyses typically involve averaging data from ~55 specimens per species and cross-validating herbarium-derived proxies with both contemporary field observations and citizen science records. Crowdsourcing initiatives like CrowdCurio have further enriched databases, enabling the application of advanced statistical frameworks to parse inter- and intra-specific variation in climate sensitivity. This integration strengthens the reliability of derived trends, particularly in areas that have historically been underrepresented (e.g., the tropics and Arctic regions).

## Methodological Considerations and Advanced Statistical Techniques

### Addressing Collection Biases

Herbaria collections inherently suffer from biases—temporal, spatial, and taxonomic—stemming from historical collection practices and misidentification issues. Advances in metadata curation and rigorous standardization protocols are vital for mitigating these biases. Modern statistical approaches, such as mixed-effects models, occupancy models, and bias-correction methods, allow researchers to account for these discrepancies. Additionally, Bayesian hierarchical models have been employed to manage inter- and intra-specific variability, thereby refining conclusions drawn about phenological sensitivities to climatic change.

### Machine Learning and Automated Image Analysis

The confluence of millions of images now available from digital herbaria and machine-learning-based image analysis has revolutionized data extraction methodologies. Techniques like convolutional neural networks are used to detect subtle phenological features (e.g., flowering stages, leaf-out) and morphological traits. These tools not only amplify the throughput of data extraction but also enhance the resolution at which researchers can study shifts in phenology. With these methods, it becomes increasingly feasible to conduct analyses across multiple scales, from localized studies to continental surveys.

### Coupling with High-Resolution Climate Data

Robust integration of herbarium records with both historical and current climate data (drawn from high-resolution datasets such as PRISM and NOAA’s GHCNM) enables the construction of predictive models. These models can forecast potential phenological mismatches (e.g., between flowering times and the emergence of pollinators) in changing climates. This information is of critical value for understanding potential shifts in community structure and can inform conservation strategies under future climate scenarios.

## Overcoming Challenges in Herbarium-Based Climate Change Research

### Temporal and Spatial Limitations

While herbaria offer expansive temporal records, the geographic distribution of specimens is not always uniform. Spatial biases can obscure localized trends, especially in regions that were historically under-sampled. Advanced GIS tools and targeted digitization initiatives can help bridge these gaps by enhancing georeferencing accuracy and expanding the spatial scope of available data.

### Degradation and Molecular Inconsistencies

The physical degradation of specimens, particularly those several decades or centuries old, poses challenges for molecular analyses. Degradation artifacts such as DNA fragmentation and chemical modifications (e.g., deamination artifacts) require specialized laboratory protocols for accurate sequencing. Adoption of clean-room facilities and validated extraction protocols is essential to ensure that genetic analyses yield reliable data.

### Validation through Cross-Methodological Approaches

Comparative studies that validate herbarium-derived data against contemporary field observations are pivotal. Such cross-validation not only reinforces the credibility of conclusions drawn from historical records but also highlights any discrepancies that might arise from inherent collection biases. Robust statistical frameworks and crowd-sourced platforms have been instrumental in this realm, refining our understanding of temporal phenological shifts and species distribution changes.

## Case Studies and Research Highlights

Several high-impact studies have illustrated the potential of herbaria for climate change research. For instance, work published in New Phytologist (2019) successfully linked shifts in plant phenology to rising spring temperatures, providing quantitative evidence of climate warming effects across numerous species. In another vein, research integrating machine-learning techniques with large-scale digitization initiatives demonstrated that advanced image analysis could effectively automate phenological assessments, scaling analyses from local field sites to continental datasets.

These studies have paved the way for more nuanced analyses involving interspecific differences in climate sensitivity. Variables such as flowering season, growth form, and native versus introduced status are now being parsed to better understand the ecological and evolutionary implications of climate change. Furthermore, innovative models—ranging from elastic net regression to piecewise models—are being utilized to predict species-specific responses to future climatic shifts, with a focus on disentangling environmental effects from those driven by underlying genetic adaptations.

## Future Directions and Recommendations

### Expanding Taxonomic and Geographic Coverage

To further unlock the potential of herbaria in climate change research, a concerted effort is needed to digitize and curate specimens from underrepresented regions and taxa. Given the substantial collection biases present in many historical datasets, targeted collection and digitization campaigns in the tropics, Arctic, and other under-sampled areas could dramatically improve the spatial resolution of climate response assessments.

### Enhancing Interdisciplinary Collaborations

Future studies should pursue greater integration between botanists, climatologists, data scientists, and citizen scientists. Multi-disciplinary collaborations will facilitate the development of more sophisticated analytical frameworks that can effectively address the multi-scale challenges presented by climate change. The incorporation of advanced statistical techniques and machine learning methods can result in more accurate and predictive models, particularly when paired with high-resolution climate data and remote sensing information.

### Leveraging Emerging Technologies

Emerging approaches, such as the integration of remote sensing data with in situ herbarium records, offer promising new directions. Satellite imagery and climate modeling can provide contextual data that enriches the ecological interpretations derived from herbarium specimens. In addition, novel extraction methods for ancient DNA and the application of automated image recognition systems will likely continue to enhance both the resolution and reliability of herbarium data analyses.

### Addressing Methodological Challenges

The field should continue to work on mitigating the methodological challenges inherent to herbarium research. Developing protocols that account for collection biases, improving digitization standards, and refining molecular techniques will be key areas for future exploration. Researchers must also continue to validate their findings through cross-methodological comparisons, ensuring that herbarium-based proxies are faithfully representing real-world biological responses.

## Conclusion

Herbaria specimens are an invaluable resource for studying the long-term impacts of climate change on plant phenology, species distributions, and morphological evolution. Through the integration of advanced digitization, genomics, machine learning, and GIS-based climate data, modern research is overcoming many of the traditional limitations associated with historical collections. Despite inherent challenges such as collection biases and specimen degradation, sophisticated statistical models and cross-validation efforts have established herbaria as a reliable proxy for tracking ecological transitions in response to climate warming.

Moving forward, to further harness the potential of herbaria in climate change research, it is imperative to expand coverage, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and continue leveraging emerging technologies. With these enhanced methodologies, herbaria will remain at the forefront of understanding and predicting the ecological ramifications of a rapidly changing climate.
