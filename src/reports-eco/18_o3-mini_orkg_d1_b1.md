## 1. Introduction

Herbaria, housing millions of preserved plant specimens collected over centuries, represent an invaluable resource for understanding how climate change affects biodiversity. These specimens are more than static records; they capture historical snapshots of flora under varied climatic conditions. The ability to derive phenological information (e.g., leaf-out and flowering times), morphological measurements, and species distribution data has opened avenues for retrospective climate change analyses and future ecological forecasting.

This report examines the strengths and challenges of using herbarium data to study climate change, and outlines methodological strategies for integrating phenological, morphological, and distributional data with climatic datasets. We give special attention to recent advancements in data digitization, controlled vocabularies, and image analysis techniques.

## 2. Phenological and Morphological Indicators

### 2.1 Phenological Shifts as Proxies for Climate Change

One of the primary applications of herbarium specimens in climate change research is the extraction of phenological data. Phenological stages, such as flowering, fruiting, and leaf emergence, are highly sensitive to temperature and precipitation patterns and can thus serve as robust proxies for assessing historical climate dynamics. For example, studies incorporating quantitative phenological indexes (PIs) have demonstrated that models integrating such indices, like those applied to Streptanthus tortuosus, can exhibit significant improvements (e.g., increased model RÂ²) when linking specimen data to climatic records such as those from the PRISM dataset.

The data has been especially revealing when large digitized collections are assembled. The exemplary integration of 2.3 million North American records digitized from 440 herbaria underscores the capacity for modern collections to address regional differences and temporal trends in phenology. These studies illustrate how phenological events recorded on herbarium specimens can inform us about shifts in climate regimes, edge expansions, or contractions in the growing season, all of which have direct implications for ecosystem functioning and species interactions.

### 2.2 Morphological Changes and Distributional Shifts

Beyond phenological data, herbarium specimens allow researchers to study morphological changes that may be closely linked to climate variables. Morphometrics such as leaf size, shape, and thickness, or even reproductive structure dimensions, vary under different climatic conditions. Although phenological changes have been more thoroughly investigated, morphological analysis is a promising frontier for detecting subtle morphological adaptations to climate change. This research could potentially reveal changes in resource allocation or stress responses over time.

In addition, changes in species distribution ranges captured in herbaria provide critical insights into how plants are tracking changing climatic envelopes. Shifts in geographical ranges, particularly in response to increased temperature or altered precipitation patterns, have been documented in several taxa. When combined with regional climate data, these distributional shifts can be used to predict future biogeographic patterns and to design effective conservation strategies.

## 3. Methodological Challenges and Innovations

### 3.1 Digitization and Standardization

Despite the wealth of data stored in herbaria, the process of digitizing specimens comes with considerable challenges. Digitization efforts must contend with:

- **Diverse Taxonomic Schemas:** Different institutions may follow varying taxonomic frameworks, complicating data aggregation and comparative analyses.
- **Inconsistent Recording of Phenological States:** Historical records often lack uniformity, with many specimens missing context about specific developmental stages or phenological states.
- **Non-Standardized Use of DarwinCore Fields:** The DarwinCore standard, while powerful, has been applied inconsistently across institutions. Efforts like those from the California Phenology Network and the Plant Specimen Phenology Task Group are crucial, as they work on developing controlled vocabularies and extensions to DarwinCore.

These standardization initiatives are essential. By enhancing the interoperability of herbarium data, they pave the way for more precise temporal and spatial analyses that can more robustly correlate phenological events with historic climate records.

### 3.2 Advanced Image Analysis Tools

Advanced image analysis represents one of the most promising technological interventions to address the variability inherent in herbarium specimens. Innovations such as custom ImageJ plugins have emerged to score phenological stages quantitatively. These tools allow researchers to:

- Extract quantitative metrics from digitized images by analyzing aspects like color, texture, and object detection corresponding to different developmental stages.
- Improve reproducibility by automating the scoring of phenological traits and reducing human error.
- Facilitate fine-scale ecological modeling by integrating high-resolution image data with climate and environmental datasets.

While these tools are still undergoing refinement, their incorportation is already leading to significant insights in pheno-climatic modeling, thus directly addressing challenges related to specimen condition variability and digitization inconsistencies.

### 3.3 Data Integration Techniques

The integration of herbarium data with external climate datasets, such as the PRISM climate data, is critically important. It enables:

- **Temporal Analysis:** Merging historical phenological records with concurrent climate data facilitates a direct assessment of climate change impacts over time.
- **Spatial Analysis:** Combining distributional data with climate models enhances our understanding of geographical shifts and assists in predicting future ranges.
- **Model Improvement:** The inclusion of quantitative phenological indexes improves model reliability, as demonstrated in studies employing the Streptanthus tortuosus case study.

Innovative data analytics and machine learning techniques have also been deployed for high-dimensional analysis. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are being explored to identify and classify phenological stages, offering the potential for rapid and accurate processing of vast digital collections.

## 4. Future Directions and Solutions to Anticipated Challenges

### 4.1 Expanding Controlled Vocabularies

One solution is to enhance the collaborative networks among herbaria by further expanding controlled vocabularies and interoperability standards. Future initiatives might focus on:

- Establishing international consortia to develop region-specific DarwinCore extensions.
- Standardizing training and annotation protocols across institutions, reducing variability in phenological state assessments.
- Leveraging crowdsourcing platforms to cross-validate phenological stage assessments and improve data coverage.

### 4.2 Integrating Multifaceted Data Sources

Another promising avenue involves integrating data not only from herbarium specimens but also from remote sensing platforms, citizen science data, and environmental sensors. The integration of high-resolution satellite imagery with digitized herbarium records could help identify micro-scale climate influences on phenological events, while citizen science initiatives (e.g., iNaturalist) can provide current comparative data. This multifaceted approach can help build robust, multi-temporal datasets capable of capturing dynamic climate-vegetation interactions.

### 4.3 Harnessing Machine Learning and AI

Machine learning offers significant potential to overcome current bottlenecks in digitization and data standardization. Some potential advancements include:

- **Automated Phenological Analysis:** Using neural network architectures to automatically annotate phenological stages can reduce manual workload and improve consistency.
- **Dynamic Image Correction:** AI tools could be developed to correct for variabilities in digitized images, such as uneven lighting or degradation, ensuring more reliable phenotype assessments.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Integrating machine learning approaches with climate datasets can improve the predictive capacity of phenological models, consequently refining our understanding of climate change impacts on plant communities.

### 4.4 Addressing Temporal Biases

Herbarium data are not free from biases; temporal sampling biases arise because collection efforts were often opportunistic or driven by colonial-era exploration patterns. Addressing these biases requires:

- Developing statistical correction methods to normalize for uneven sampling efforts.
- Augmenting herbarium data with independent contemporary field surveys and remote sensing data to create overlapping datasets.
- Employing spatio-temporal models to statistically account for and correct historical collection biases.
