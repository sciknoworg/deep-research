# Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) Relationships Across Spatial Scales: An Integrative Final Report

This report offers a detailed synthesis of recent research into the spatial scale-dependence of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships. Drawing on a wealth of empirical studies, simulations (including insights from the Cedar Creek grassland experiment), and theoretical models, we present a comprehensive framework that integrates local processes, regional dynamics, and broader ecosystem context. Throughout the report we cover mechanistic understandings, scale-specific effects, and integrative modeling approaches that blend empirical and theoretical frameworks.

## 1. Introduction and Scope

The central question driving this work is: **How does the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship depend on the spatial scale?** Addressing this query requires analysis from local plots to regional and global landscapes, encompassing taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity along with multiple ecosystem functions. Our synthesis spans a wide spatial spectrum, interlinking empirical evidence and theoretical modeling, and emphasizing the interplay of spatial autocorrelation, species turnover, connectivity, and environmental variability. This report underscores the necessity of integrating multitrophic perspectives—as seen in recent work linking plant and higher trophic levels via trait-based and evolutionary approaches—with the demands of modern landscape-level management.

## 2. Scale-Dependence of BEF Relationships

### 2.1 Local versus Regional Processes

At **local spatial scales**, empirical and simulation studies reveal complex, nonlinear BEF relationships. For example, niche complementarity can yield a hump-shaped curve where extremely high species diversity may, counterintuitively, lead to diminishing ecosystem function. This pattern is largely due to saturation effects where excessive overlap in resource use or competition leads to suboptimal functioning. In contrast, **regional scales** exhibit trends where the diversity-ecosystem function curve tends to be linear, underscoring that when viewed at broader scales, the cumulative effect of species turnover, dispersal, and spatial heterogeneity becomes more pronounced. This divergence likely reflects distinct dynamics: local processes are influenced by species interactions and microhabitat variability, while regional patterns are governed by dispersal among patches and beta diversity (species turnover among sites).

A key insight from simulations such as those based on Lotka-Volterra competition models is that lower environmental autocorrelation across time and space necessitates a higher number of species to sustain ecosystem functioning as the scale increases. This suggests that conservation efforts might need to consider scale-specific biodiversity thresholds to ensure function in the face of environmental variability.

### 2.2 Environmental Heterogeneity and Autocorrelation

Environmental factors play a critical role. Research indicates that the nature of spatial or temporal autocorrelation in environmental variability—whether low or high—modulates the BEF curve. In conditions of low autocorrelation (i.e., high variability), more species are required to maintain ecosystem functions over larger scales, leading to a steeper BEF relationship. Conversely, at high levels of environmental autocorrelation (more uniform conditions), the relationship exhibits a less dramatic slope change. Mechanistic drivers include local heterogeneity in diversity, species turnover, and the aggregation of populations across different habitats.

Experimental evidence, notably from the Cedar Creek grassland experiment, illustrates that local variability contributes significantly to shifts in the slope and R² of the BEF curve. Thus, both the intensity and the structure of environmental variability are critical in interpreting biodiversity effects as scales change.

## 3. Mechanistic Frameworks and Modeling Approaches

### 3.1 Integrative and Parsimonious Models

Recent advances in modeling have contributed significantly in bridging local and regional ecological processes. A parsimonious modeling framework developed at Maynooth University is noteworthy. This model uses random effects in traditional univariate analyses and incorporates multivariate techniques to assess multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously. Such methods enhance the precision of quantifying biodiversity effects, especially in species‐rich ecosystems. These modeling approaches provide a robust foundation for translating findings from controlled experiments to predictions relevant for landscape management.

### 3.2 Multitrophic Interactions and Trait-Based Approaches

The integration of multitrophic frameworks is an important frontier in BEF research. Trait-based approaches are being extended from plants to higher trophic levels, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of how functional diversity impacts ecosystem service delivery. Emerging research into eco-evolutionary dynamics stresses the importance of FAIR data and integrated methodologies to scale insights from small-scale biodiversity experiments to large-scale landscape and ecosystem management.

For example, compared to plant diversity, herbivore diversity has been shown to have a stronger positive effect on certain ecosystem functions. Such findings emphasize the need for integrating across trophic levels and considering how both dominant and subordinate species contribute to essential ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling, pest control, and primary productivity.

### 3.3 Spatially Explicit Metacommunity and Metaecosystem Models

Recent integrated frameworks that combine metacommunity, metaecosystem, and spatially explicit approaches highlight the importance of connectivity and spatial structure. Models that explicitly incorporate spatial autocorrelation and environmental variability underscore the role of local (α-diversity) and regional (β- and γ-diversity) processes in enhancing ecosystem stability. Empirical studies conducted in various settings—from forest stands and grasslands to farmland insect communities—illustrate that both local species interactions and spatial insurance effects mediated by beta diversity contribute to the overall stability and function of ecosystems.

## 4. Multifunctionality and the Role of Different Biodiversity Facets

Multifunctionality in ecosystems is not solely determined by species richness but also by the composition of biodiversity—taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional. Studies across diverse ecosystems, such as those in drylands and grasslands, have revealed that early diverging lineages and functional redundancy are pivotal for driving nutrient cycles and maintaining ecosystem services. Dominant species can exert significant but sometimes function-specific effects. For instance, in certain grassland ecosystems, species like Andropogon gerardii affect particular functions, while a suite of early diverging or subordinate species might be critical for overall multifunctionality.

As ecosystem functions become more diversified (e.g., nutrient cycling, carbon storage, pollination, herbivory regulation), the positive effects of biodiversity can become more pronounced. These effects are amplified over time and with increasing spatial connectivity, suggesting that the full suite of ecosystem functions is best supported by a multi-faceted approach to biodiversity.

## 5. Synthesis of Conceptual Frameworks and Future Directions

### 5.1 Linking Local, Regional, and Global Scales

The array of studies reviewed highlights that the BEF relationship is inherently scale-dependent and requires an integrative conceptual framework that links local interactions with regional and global patterns. Such a framework must encompass:

- **Local Factors:** Including species interactions, niche complementarity, and microhabitat variability which often produce nonlinear (hump-shaped) BEF responses at small spatial scales.
- **Regional Dynamics:** Involving species turnover, dispersal processes, beta diversity, and spatial insurance effects which tend to linearize the BEF relationship due to emergent properties from a network of local processes.
- **Global Context:** Where broader gradients of environmental heterogeneity and large-scale connectivity may further modulate biodiversity thresholds needed to sustain ecosystem functionalities across extensive landscapes.

### 5.2 Advancing Methodological and Conceptual Approaches

Several opportunities for future research include:

- **Hybrid Correlative‐Mechanistic Models:** Developing models that blend detailed empirical data with mechanistic understanding will help overcome limitations in data quality and computational resources. Virtual species and macro‐ecological relationships can potentially fill gaps where traditional methods fall short.
- **Enhanced Multitrophic and Trait-Based Integrations:** Expanding trait-based methods to incorporate interactions among diverse trophic levels, particularly focusing on herbivore and predator functions, may yield deeper insights into ecosystem resilience and multifunctionality.
- **Spatiotemporal Scaling and Environmental Autocorrelation:** More rigorous explorations into how environmental autocorrelation influences BEF relationships can help in determining species thresholds essential under varying climatic scenarios, particularly under rapid global change.
- **Leveraging FAIR Data Practices:** With the increasing emphasis on data accessibility and interoperability, future studies must adhere to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to enhance the reproducibility and scaling of experimental findings.

### 5.3 Implications for Conservation and Management

The scale-dependent nature of BEF relationships has profound implications for conservation policy and ecosystem management. When designing reserves, restoration projects, or biodiversity management strategies, it is essential to address:

- **Spatial Heterogeneity:** Recognizing that local diversity variations and species turnover can both enhance and sometimes constrain ecosystem function.
- **Connectivity and Dispersal Processes:** Ensuring that landscape management practices promote connectivity to harness the benefits of spatial insurance effects.
- **Adaptive Management Under Climate Variability:** Implementing approaches that account for shifts in BEF curves with changes in environmental autocorrelation, which is increasingly variable due to climate change.

## 6. Concluding Remarks

In summary, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is multifaceted and scale-dependent. At local scales, nonlinear dynamics such as hump-shaped functions emerge due to niche complementarity and localized species interactions, while regional analyses often reveal linear trends driven by broader turnover, connectivity, and dispersal mechanisms. Integrated models bridging metacommunity dynamics with trait-based, multitrophic frameworks offer promising avenues for future research. Furthermore, the adoption of hybrid correlative-mechanistic approaches and FAIR data practices will be critical in scaling experimental results to landscape-level management practices.

This comprehensive research synthesis not only unites various strands of current BEF research but also proposes several new directions. In addressing the challenges posed by global change, developing robust predictive models that accurately capture scale-dependent biodiversity thresholds is paramount. As research continues, the balance between local and regional biodiversity dynamics will remain central to understanding and managing ecosystem stability and multifunctionality in an increasingly variable world.
