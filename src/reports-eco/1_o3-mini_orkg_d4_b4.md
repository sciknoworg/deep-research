# Final Report: Effects of Management Extensification on Grasslands Plant Diversity

## Abstract

This report synthesizes extensive research on the impacts of management extensification—defined broadly as the reduction of inputs such as fertilization, mowing frequency, and grazing intensity—and its effects on grasslands plant diversity. Drawing on decades of quantitative analyses, long-term experiments, meta-analyses, and case studies across Mediterranean, temperate, sub-Mediterranean, and alpine grasslands, we detail how different management regimes influence taxonomic (species richness), functional, and phylogenetic aspects of plant diversity. The synthesis elucidates the direct and cascading effects on plant community composition, soil microbial dynamics, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem multifunctionality. Integrated research findings, advanced modelling approaches, and economic–ecological assessments further enhance our understanding, offering both theoretical and practical frameworks for sustaining biodiversity in changing grassland systems.

## Introduction

Grasslands are among the most ecologically and economically important ecosystems globally. The transformation from high-input, intensive management systems to more variable, extensified practices is gaining traction in agricultural policy and ecological restoration contexts, particularly within the Mediterranean basin and temperate regions. Management extensification, characterized by measures such as reduced fertilization, lower mowing frequency, and moderated grazing intensity, aims to conserve biodiversity and restore ecosystem multifunctionality.

Recent research highlights the nuanced relationships between management regimes and plant diversity metrics, including species richness, functional trait variation, and phylogenetic diversity. In this report, we integrate learnings from diverse studies to comprehensively examine how such management shifts impact grassland ecosystems. Emphasis is placed on complex interactions among above- and belowground components, long-term dynamic responses, and the interplay between biotic and abiotic drivers.

## Methodological Approaches Across Studies

### Quantitative Analyses and Multivariate Techniques

Several studies have employed canonical correspondence analysis, variation partitioning, and structural equation modeling to dissect the effects of various grazing regimes (extensive vs. intensive) on plant community assembly. For instance, in Mediterranean systems (eastern Portugal, Central Apennines), quantitative analyses revealed that grazing intensity shifts species composition and functional diversity. Selective loss of endemic species, a decline in legume cover, and changes in bryophyte abundance are often observed under increasing management intensification.

### Long-Term Experiments

Experiments such as the Jena Experiment and other long-duration studies have tracked changes over several years or decades. Findings show that combining legumes with fertilization reduces microbial specific respiration by altering microbial stoichiometry (C-to-N ratios), despite minimal changes to microbial biomass. Additionally, grazing cessation studies indicate shrub encroachment, whereas moderated grazing can sustain higher plant richness, thereby elucidating a critical balance in land-use dynamics.

### Meta-Analyses and Experimental Syntheses

Meta-analyses have identified that environmental variables (nutrient availability, light, soil moisture) control biomass allocation and influence diversity outcomes. Consistent patterns emerge whereby management extensification tends to mitigate nutrient-induced competitive exclusion, thereby enhancing asynchronous species dynamics. This phenomenon is pivotal for both stabilization and resilience across temporal scales.

## Impacts of Extensification on Biodiversity Facets

### Taxonomic Diversity (Species Richness)

Multiple studies across grassland systems support the notion that reduced management intensity—particularly through moderate/extensive grazing and reduced fertilization—can bolster species richness. For example, long-term field experiments in sub-Mediterranean systems have demonstrated that grazing, when applied in a balanced manner, prevents shrub encroachment while promoting heterogeneous sward structures. Moreover, species richness positively correlates with increased soil microbial basal respiration and biomass, reinforcing the notion that plant–soil feedback loops are essential for nutrient cycling.

### Functional Diversity and Trait Variability

Functional diversity is arguably more sensitive to management practices than taxonomic diversity. Research involving canonical analyses and experimental manipulations shows that reduced fertilization, coupled with the maintenance of functional groups such as legumes and herbaceous species, can promote functional richness. Changes in plant traits—including specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and maximum vegetative height—are modulated by environmental gradients and management practices. For example, studies have documented a decrease in SLA and corresponding shifts in other morphological traits under intensified grazing, while extensification allows for a broader spectrum of resource-acquisition strategies among coexisting species.

### Phylogenetic Diversity

Phylogenetic diversity studies indicate that management practices differentially affect lineages distinguished by life history and physiological constraints. Extensification often fosters the persistence of evolutionarily distinct clades such as Fabaceae and other nitrogen-fixing plants. Conversely, intensive regimes tend to promote phylogenetic homogenization, potentially reducing the range of ecosystem functions due to lower trait variability. This outcome is amplified by cascading effects on trophic interactions, including those with pollinators and soil biota, which rely on diverse plant trait expression.

## Cascading Effects on Soil Microbial Communities and Nutrient Cycling

Grassland management practices are not only pivotal for aboveground plant diversity, but they also fundamentally alter belowground ecosystems. Research detailing grazing impacts reveals that spatial heterogeneity in soil microbial assemblages responds dynamically to plant community changes. For example, studies employing network analysis indicate that grazing livestock (cattle, sheep, goats) modulate microbial clusters differently when compared to native herbivores. These shifts in microbial community structure have significant implications for soil carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling.

Short-term experiments and isotopic tracers have shown that fast-growing legumes intensify root-associated priming effects, accelerating the mineralization of soil organic matter. However, reduced fertilization and moderate grazing tend to optimize nitrogen cycling by maintaining diverse microbial communities and moderating the C-to-N stoichiometry. Thus, an integrative management framework that links plant and microbial dynamics is essential to maintain ecosystem multifunctionality.

---

## Integrated Management Frameworks and Multi-Scale Dynamics

### Grazing Combinations: Mixed-Management vs. Continuous Grazing

Empirical studies strongly support the merits of mixed grazing–mowing regimes over continuous grazing. In semiarid and temperate grasslands, integrated management regimes have been shown to maintain higher species evenness, a more favorable Shannon diversity index, and reduce the formation of heavily grazed patches. This patch-scale management fosters asynchronous species dynamics that underpin ecosystem resilience. In contrast, continuous grazing frequently leads to the formation of degraded patches accompanied by spatial homogenization, thereby undermining both above- and belowground diversity.

### Restoration and Long-Term Legacy Effects

Long-term restoration experiments underscore that the intensity of interventions (e.g., topsoil removal and propagule addition) determines the trajectory of species recovery and ecosystem multifunctionality. Low-intervention approaches may fail to achieve desired outcomes—plant species richness in such cases may account for only 54% of multifunctionality. Conversely, high-intervention approaches, although costlier, meet or exceed benchmarks seen in semi-natural grasslands.

Legacy effects from chronic fertilization and historical overgrazing further complicate the restoration dynamics. Studies such as the Park Grass Experiment demonstrate that legacy effects can persist over decades, altering species–area relationships and microbial community scaling patterns. The need to design long-term, adaptive management strategies that integrate these legacy effects is critical for the sustainable management of grasslands.

### Economic–Ecological Trade-Offs and Policy Implications

Economic evaluations reveal that intensive inputs produce near-term returns at the cost of biodiversity. In contrast, extensification strategies, especially when integrated with agri-environmental payments and PES schemes, strike a more sustainable balance over time. Simulation models spanning landscape scales have demonstrated that land sparing can outperform land sharing scenarios in cost-effectiveness while also supporting enhanced biodiversity outcomes, particularly when field margins and landscape heterogeneity are optimized. Policies such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy further underscore the need to align economic incentives with ecological objectives, thereby facilitating the transition towards more extensive grassland management practices.

## Context-Dependent Impacts and Future Directions

### Scale Dependence and Environmental Heterogeneity

One recurrent theme across studies is the scale dependence of grazing impacts. Local species loss and spatial homogenization at fine scales may not necessarily conflict with regional-scale ecosystem stability if adequately buffered by patch-scale β-diversity. Evidence from Mediterranean grasslands, coastal ecosystems, and even alpine meadows suggests that higher β-diversity among patches synergistically enhances multifunctionality, although management must be delicately tailored to avoid unintended detrimental effects such as shrub encroachment or excessive nutrient depletion.

### Climate Change Interactions

Climate change introduces additional layers of complexity. Experimental warming studies in Tibetan alpine meadows reveal interactions where increased temperatures alter microbial community structures and undermine conventional diversity stabilizing mechanisms. Moderate grazing, however, can partially counteract warming-induced shifts in soil bacterial α-diversity. Future research should continue to explore these interactive effects and incorporate climate-adaptive management practices that can buffer grassland ecosystems against extreme events.

### Novel Approaches and Advanced Modelling

Recent developments in mechanistic models (e.g., Gemini and DynaGraM) offer promising avenues for integrating plant functional traits and competitive resource dynamics into decision support systems. Further, the integration of microbial diversity measures into quantitative soil C and N models provides a more complete picture of ecosystem responses to management interventions. Advanced simulation and structural equation modelling can be leveraged to predict long-term outcomes, thus informing adaptive management strategies in diverse ecological and socio-economic contexts.

### Potential Areas for Future Research and Policy Action

1. **Fine-Scale Grazing Management:** Future work should consider the patch-scale application of grazing–mowing regimes to enhance not only plant species richness but also to maintain microbial diversity and soil functionality.

2. **Integrating Belowground and Aboveground Dynamics:** While numerous studies have tackled one side of the equation, integrative research linking soil feedbacks and plant diversity remains critical, particularly in the context of microbial stoichiometry and carbon sequestration.

3. **Long-Term Legacy Effects:** More research is required to understand how legacy effects from historical management practices (e.g., continuous fertilization) persist and interact with current extensification strategies.

4. **Economic Models and Policy Frameworks:** Continued refinement of economic–ecological models is necessary. Integrating detailed cost analyses with biodiversity outcomes will allow for more effective PES schemes and agri-environment policies, thereby aligning economic incentives with sustainable management practices.

5. **Cross-Ecosystem Comparisons:** Given the variability observed across Mediterranean, temperate, and alpine systems, comparative studies can help decipher universal principles and context-specific responses, thereby guiding regionally tailored management interventions.

## Conclusion

The cumulative research indicates that management extensification—a combination of reduced fertilization, moderated grazing, and integrated mixed-management regimes—can maintain or even enhance grassland plant diversity under appropriate conditions. By preserving species richness, promoting functional and phylogenetic diversity, and aligning with sustainable soil microbial dynamics, extensified management practices offer a promising pathway to reconcile agricultural production with conservation goals. However, the success of these strategies relies on a nuanced appreciation of spatial heterogeneity, legacy effects, and the interactive pressures of climate change.

Optimizing these management interventions requires a holistic approach that integrates plant–soil feedback mechanisms, multi-scale biodiversity assessments, and economic trade-offs. Advances in modelling and long-term experimental designs provide a solid foundation for predicting ecosystem responses and informing policy. Ultimately, the research surveyed herein underscores that adaptive, context-specific management is the key to sustaining grassland ecosystems amidst global environmental changes.
