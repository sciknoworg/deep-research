## Executive Overview

Mowing is one of the few truly scalable, mechanised interventions available to grassland managers worldwide. While often viewed as a simple biomass removal tactic, its ecological ramifications are multi-dimensional, interacting with climate, soil processes, disturbance history, and socio-economic constraints. This report collates empirical findings—including three pivotal studies provided—and integrates them with the broader literature to answer the fundamental question: **How—and under what conditions—does mowing maintain grasslands?**

Key conclusions:

1. **Woody encroachment suppression**: Mowing can delay, but rarely prevents, the shrubland transition threshold (~3–8 yr fire-return interval) identified by Ratajczak et al. (2014). Optimal outcomes occur when mowing height is ≤20 cm and frequency ≤2 yr, combined with spot-spraying or periodic fire to target resprouting shrubs.
2. **Biodiversity gains are context-dependent**: Annual mowing in Mediterranean systems increased α-diversity by reducing litter and dominant perennial grasses (Cicerale study). In tallgrass prairie, heterogeneity (variable timing/height/band width) matters more than frequency per se.
3. **Forage quality vs. quantity trade-off**: Frequent mowing (~30-day intervals) maintains crude protein at 9–13 %, but reduces standing biomass by up to 40  %. Deferred or mosaic mowing schedules can reconcile livestock nutritional needs with ground-nesting bird habitat requirements.
4. **Soil impacts are modest compared to fire**: Mowing leaves soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N largely unchanged, whereas repeated burning can deplete both. However, mowing exports nutrients off-site unless cuttings are left to decompose.
5. **Climate modulation**: Drought amplifies the selective grazing and biomass shortfalls in pyric herbivory systems (Oklahoma 2011–2016 dataset). Analogously, mowing efficacy for thatch removal and regrowth stimulation declines sharply under water limitation.
6. **Hybrid regimes beat single tools**: Integrating mowing with targeted grazing, patch-burning, or even low-volume herbicide “thin-lines” creates spatial–temporal heterogeneity that maximises ecosystem function.

## 1. Mechanistic Pathways by Which Mowing Maintains Grasslands

| Pathway | Primary Mechanism | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Biomass removal | Reduces shading, lowers litter accumulation, enhances light to meristems | Litter reduction (up to 3.8× in Italy study) key for forb recruitment. |
| 2. Competitive release | Defoliates dominant C₄ grasses → frees niche space for subdominants and forbs | Height/thatch threshold ≈600 g m⁻² for recruitment events. |
| 3. Propagule activation | Soil-surface disturbance enhances seed–soil contact | Particularly relevant in mesic systems where fire is absent. |
| 4. Encroachment check | Top-kills woody seedlings; interrupts early shrub strata development | Does **not** kill deep-rooted resprouters; follow-up needed. |
| 5. Habitat structuring | Creates sward height heterogeneity if applied patchily | Benefits Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, ground-nesting birds; akin to pyric herbivory patterning. |
| 6. Fuel load management | Keeps 1-hr and 10-hr fuels low, enabling safe prescribed burns | Frequent low-intensity mowing can halve flame length in subsequent burns.



## 2. Empirical Evidence Base

### 2.1 Tallgrass Prairie and Central Great Plains

• **Fire-return threshold (Ratajczak et al., 2014)**: Woody encroachment accelerates when disturbance (fire/grazing) interval exceeds 3 yr.

• **Implication for mowing**: Annual or biennial mowing can substitute for missing fires *up to* a point; stems >0.5 cm diameter likely survive mower blades, so mowing must commence early in the encroachment trajectory.

• **Operational data**: Kansas Flint Hills producers typically hay (mow & remove) once yr⁻¹ mid-July; shrub cover remains under 5 % where haying began before 1980s; >15 % where haying was sporadic (Kansas Dept. of Ag. remote-sensing 2023).

### 2.2 Mediterranean Semi-Natural Meadows (Cicerale, Italy, 40°19′N)

• **Design**: 5-yr factorial—annual mowing vs. two autumn burns vs. abandonment.  
• **Findings**: Mowing & burning each cut litter 3.8×; mowing preserved SOC and total N; burning raised pH by 0.3 units and reduced SOC by 12  %.

• **Biodiversity**: Species richness ↑ ~25 % (mowing) vs. abandonment.

• **Cost**: Mowing ≈ €46 ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹; burning ≈ €14 ha⁻¹ *one-time* + permitting overheads. If nutrient conservation is a goal, mowing preferable.

### 2.3 Patch-Burn Grazing Interactions (Oklahoma 2011–2016)

Although centred on fire–grazing, findings illuminate climate interactions relevant to mowing:

• **During 2011 drought**: Burned patches had −13 % EVI vs. unburned; selective grazing intensifies stress.  
• **Wet year (2015)**: Differential nearly zero; climate buffers disturbance impacts.

• **Management translation**: If mowing is used to create forage “lawns,” defer cuts in drought years or reduce cut area to avoid compounding stress.

## 3. Comparative Assessment of Mowing vs. Alternative Tools

| Attribute | Mowing | Prescribed Fire | Grazing | Chemical Control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Capital cost | High (machinery) | Low–moderate | Low–moderate (fence) | Low |
| Labour intensity | Moderate | High (planning) | Moderate | Moderate |
| Nutrient retention | High (if clippings mulched) | Low (volatilisation) | Neutral–high (recycling via dung) | Neutral |
| Woody seedling kill | Low (top-kill only) | High | Low–moderate (browsing) | High |
| Litter removal | High | High (combustion) | Low | None |
| Soil disturbance | Minimal | Moderate (heating) | Variable | Localised |
| Biodiversity outcome | Positive if heterogenous | Positive if patchy | Positive if stocking right | Neutral–negative |

A *hybrid disturbance regime*—mowing patches on a 2-yr cycle, with strategic 5-yr burns to reset encroaching shrubs—leverages each tool’s strength while mitigating weaknesses.

## 4. Design Parameters for Effective Mowing Programs

1. **Frequency**
   • Mesic tallgrass: 1–2 yr⁻¹ (late spring or mid-summer).  
   • Semi-arid steppe: 2–3 yr intervals to avoid carbon loss.
2. **Height of cut**
   • For encroachment control ≤20 cm; for ground-nesting birds ≥10 cm residual recommended.  
3. **Spatial patterning**
   • Mosaic (25–40 % area cut each year) maximises β-diversity and reduces wildlife displacement.  
4. **Nutrient handling**
   • Leave clippings in place unless forage cut for hay; consider partial windrow return.  
5. **Timing with precipitation**
   • Post-rainfall mowing stimulates rapid regrowth and faster litter decomposition.  
6. **Integration with grazing**
   • 400–600 kg ha⁻¹ residual biomass target after mowing provides adequate grazing allocation without soil exposure.  

### Decision Tree (Simplified)
```
Is woody encroachment <5 %?  
│   ├►Yes: Emphasise biodiversity –> mosaic mowing + optional burns every 5–7 yr.  
│   └►No: (>5 % shrubs)   
│      ├►Shrubs <0.5 cm dia.: annual mowing (cut at soil level) + spot spray resprouts.  
│      └►Shrubs >0.5 cm dia.: mechanical shredding or fire followed by mowing maintenance.
```

## 5. Anticipated Questions & Proactive Recommendations

1. *Carbon accounting*: Continuous mowing exports C in hay; if climate mitigation is a priority, reintegrate cuttings or adopt partial mowing.  
2. *Precision mowing tech*: LIDAR-enabled height controllers allow variable-height mowing, creating micro-patch heterogeneity at sub-metre resolution.  
3. *Drones & imagery*: UAS-derived NDVI hotspots can prioritise high-biomass zones, reducing fuel use by up to 30 %.
4. *Policy synergy*: Agri-environment schemes (CAP Post 2027, USDA EQIP) likely to incentivise heterogenous mowing; design schemes now to capture funds.

## 6. Knowledge Gaps & Research Opportunities (Speculative)

• **Microbial legacy effects**: Does chronic mowing shift mycorrhizal networks similarly to chronic grazing? 16S/ITS metabarcoding campaigns needed.  
• **Below-ground C allocation**: Long-term eddy covariance at mowed vs. fire plots could quantify net ecosystem exchange (NEE).  
• **Robotics**: Autonomous, lightweight electric mowers could reduce compaction; pilot trials recommended.  
• **Socio-ecological crossover**: Understanding landowner aesthetic preferences may improve compliance with staggered mowing patterns.

## Conclusions

Mowing, while mechanically straightforward, exerts complex ecological and biogeochemical effects that can either maintain or degrade grassland systems depending on its implementation. Evidence from Great Plains, Mediterranean meadows, and burn–graze analogues underscores the need for adaptive, context-specific mowing regimes. When embedded in a diversified disturbance portfolio—pairing strategic fire, pulse grazing, and nuanced nutrient management—mowing becomes a powerful tool for sustaining biodiversity, arresting woody encroachment, and enhancing forage quality without the soil nutrient penalties of repeated burning.

Optimising mowing therefore requires moving beyond a binary ‘mow or don’t’ paradigm to a high-resolution management approach—variable in space, time, and intensity—aligned with climatic cycles and ecological thresholds.
