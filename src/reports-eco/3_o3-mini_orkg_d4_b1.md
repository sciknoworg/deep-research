## 1. Introduction

Grassland ecosystems are highly dynamic systems influenced by multiple disturbances and management practices. Mowing is one of the primary anthropogenic disturbances used to manage these systems. It is critical not only for aesthetic and economic goals but also for conserving biodiversity, controlling woody species, and maintaining favorable soil properties. Mowing, as a form of mechanical disturbance, plays a nuanced role in grasslands by removing accumulated biomass, thereby reducing litter, controlling woody encroachment, and favoring native herbaceous species. This report integrates learnings from diverse geographical regions including temperate European grasslands, montane systems in South Africa, and semi‐arid regions such as the sagebrush steppe in North America, to provide an in-depth analysis of mowing as a management tool.

## 2. Ecological Mechanisms Underpinning Mowing

### 2.1. Biomass Removal and Energy Allocation

Mowing directly removes aboveground biomass, which results in several ecological cascades:

- **Reduction of Litter:** By removing dead and senesced matter, mowing reduces litter accumulation that might otherwise suppress germination and recruitment of native grasses. This is similar in some respects to the effects of prescribed burning, though mowing tends to be more moderate in altering chemical soil properties.

- **Resource Allocation:** With the removal of biomass, plants often shift energy allocation to regrowth. This can promote a more vigorous turnover of herbaceous species, thereby maintaining dynamic equilibrium and preventing dominance by any single species. In microbial communities, the removal of dense organic layers can stimulate nutrient cycling.

### 2.2. Suppression of Woody Encroachment

Mowing is particularly effective at controlling the establishment and spread of woody species. In grassland systems where woody species such as Prosopis glandulosa and other encroachers are a concern, mowing removes the competitive advantage of seedlings and saplings that require uninterrupted access to light. Over successive mowing events, the suppression of woody species is enhanced, allowing native grasses to flourish and thus preserving a biodiverse herbaceous layer. This practice mirrors some outcomes of prescribed burning and rotational grazing strategies in mesquite savannas, though the mechanisms differ since mowing eschews the thermal effects of fire.

### 2.3. Enhanced Soil Infiltration and Nutrient Cycling

Several studies indicate that mowing preserves stable soil infiltration rates relative to burning. Removal of the litter layer mimics some of the disturbance effects observed in fire regimes but without the short-term spike in protein content or the potential detrimental impacts on soil structure posed by burning. Mowing thus supports a moderate level of disturbance that fosters sustained, long-term nutrient cycling, and helps maintain soil organic matter, particularly in loamy and well-drained soils.

## 3. Practical Management Techniques in Grassland Mowing

### 3.1. Mowing Frequency and Phenological Considerations

Frequency of mowing is a critical management lever. Empirical evidence suggests a clear gradient of conservation value with mowing frequency:

- **Annual Mowing:** Consistently maintains high conservation value by curbing woody encroachment and providing regular management of biomass. Annual treatments have shown consistent ecological benefits in productive grasslands, preserving biodiversity and favoring native grass proliferation.

- **Biannual Mowing:** Offers a balance between operational feasibility and ecological impact. When timed with key phenological stages, biannual mowing can enhance flowering and seed dispersal without allowing too much biomass accumulation.

- **Triennial Mowing:** Studies indicate that extending intervals to every third year can result in a 50–60% reduction in conservation value in terms of indicator species richness. Hence, longer intervals are less advisable in systems where biodiversity is a priority.

### 3.2. Mechanical Techniques and Tool Efficacy

Field trials, including a 12-year study in southeastern Sweden, have compared different mowing tools such as the hand‐pushed sickle bar mower and grass trimmers set at varying cutting heights (0 cm vs. 5 cm) in semi-natural grasslands. Findings show that, when conducted properly, different mowing technologies tend to produce equivalent outcomes in terms of vegetation composition and species richness. Adjustments in cutting height can be used to fine-tune the balance between biomass removal and preservation of flowering structures, important for reproductive cycles of native species.

### 3.3. Timing and Seasonality

The seasonality of mowing operations is another crucial determinant of ecological outcomes. Timing mowing operations to coincide with critical stages in plant growth (e.g., post-flowering periods) can minimize adverse impacts on seed setting while efficiently controlling woody species. In contrast to burning, which often follows a strict seasonal calendar (e.g., alternate autumn/spring burns every 18 months), mowing allows greater flexibility and can be deployed in response to immediate climatic or hydrological conditions, thereby reducing risks associated with prescribed burning in sensitive periods.

## 4. Comparative Analysis: Mowing versus Burning and Grazing

### 4.1. Mowing versus Prescribed Burning

Comparative studies across regions such as Nebraska and South Africa have highlighted key differences between mowing and burning:

- **Forage Accumulation and Soil Properties:** Mowing tends to promote forage accumulation and stable soil infiltration, making it preferable in situations where soil physical integrity is prioritized. In contrast, burning may temporarily increase forage protein levels but with potential negative effects on soil texture and structure.

- **Biodiversity Impacts:** While burning in montane grasslands (e.g., KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg) can sustain primary production and protein levels, it simultaneously risks reducing the replicability of grassland indicator species over time as observed in Swedish long-term trials. Mowing is associated with a subtler shift in species composition, often supporting higher native species richness when appropriately timed.

### 4.2. Mowing versus Grazing

Grazing, particularly at low intensities, can sometimes yield higher conservation values by mimicking natural herbivory. However, the meta-analyses highlight that grazing’s effectiveness is highly contingent on management intensity. Low-intensity grazing sometimes inadvertently increases excess nitrogen and woody species establishment. Mowing, as a controlled mechanical removal method, offers consistent results by uniformly reducing biomass and mitigating these issues, especially in nutrient-enriched or overgrazed systems. Furthermore, mowing’s predictability and scalability can be advantageous over the variable outcomes seen with natural grazing patterns.

## 5. Soil, Hydrology, and Plant Community Interactions

### 5.1. Influence of Soil Type and Moisture Regimes

Site-specific soil conditions, including soil type (loamy vs. sandy) and moisture content, critically influence management outcomes. Research from European and Dutch grasslands underscores that:

- **Loamy Soils:** Typically respond well to mowing, showing beneficial increases in belowground biomass and soil organic matter. These soils, with higher moisture retention, are less prone to the exotic annual invasion that may follow burning in drier systems.

- **Sandy and Low Water Holding Capacity Soils:** Require a more cautious approach. In systems like the sagebrush steppe, mowing may help control herbaceous fuel loads, reducing wildfire potential and keeping woody expansion in check; however, the timing of mowing in relation to rainfall is crucial to prevent post-treatment invasion by exotic species.

### 5.2. Plant Community Functional Traits and Soil Carbon Stocks

Plant community traits—particularly traits such as Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC) and overall functional diversity—are intimately linked with soil carbon stocks and productivity. Long-term management practices such as mowing help maintain a balance between woody suppression and the promotion of biodiversity. This balance is particularly important in productive grasslands where sustained grazing or uncontrolled burning might skew the composition toward species less beneficial for soil carbon retention.

## 6. Long-Term Impact and Future Perspectives

### 6.1. Long-Term Field Findings

Multiple long-term studies have demonstrated the sustainability of mowing as a grassland management technique. For instance, the 12-year trials in Sweden and meta-analyses encompassing several decades of research reveal that mowing consistently maintains species richness, supports stable soil conditions, and effectively controls woody species despite the variations brought by different environmental contexts.

### 6.2. Integrating Mowing with Other Practices

It is increasingly evident that the best outcomes are achieved through integrated management regimes. Combining mowing with rotational grazing or periodic mild burns may further optimize ecosystem services, particularly in systems experiencing droughts or rapidly changing climate conditions. For example, regions like the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg have successfully used an integrated approach where prescribed burning and rotational grazing are synchronized with mowing to combat woody encroachment and enhance biodiverse outcomes.

### 6.3. Emerging Technologies and Adaptive Management

Looking forward, there is a significant scope for integrating new technologies in grassland management. Remote sensing via drones and high-resolution satellite imagery can provide real-time biomass assessments, while AI-driven predictive models can better estimate optimal mowing schedules tailored to hydrological conditions, biomass accumulation, and species phenology. Such adaptive management frameworks would allow systems to tailor interventions on a micro-scale, ensuring precise control of ecological outcomes.

### 6.4. Socio-economic and Policy Considerations

Beyond ecological and operational factors, socio-economic and policy dimensions are important. Mowing, by virtue of its predictability and lower volatility compared to burning, often faces fewer regulatory restrictions. However, it requires labor and operational precision, meaning that cost-benefit analyses must be conducted on a case-by-case basis. Policy frameworks that incorporate incentive-based mechanisms for sustainable mowing operations can ultimately align short-term economic benefits with long-term ecological stability.

## 7. Conclusions and Recommendations

Mowing serves as a cornerstone in grassland management for several critical reasons:

- It effectively reduces woody species encroachment by removing biomass and altering competitive dynamics in favor of native grasses.
- Its impacts on soil structure and nutrient cycling are more moderate compared to burning, offering long-term stability.
- Mowing frequency and timing are crucial variables, with annual or biannual interventions generally outperforming less frequent regimes in maintaining biodiversity and ecological integrity.
- Comparative evidence suggests that while grazing and burning each have their niches, mowing provides a reliable, consistent intervention particularly suited to areas with sensitive soil conditions and where fine-scale control is desired.

Given the collective evidence from long-term field trials and meta-analyses, we recommend a management strategy that:

1. Prioritizes annual or biannual mowing in productive grasslands to maximize native species richness and ecological balance.
2. Integrates mowing with rotational grazing or low-intensity prescribed burns in systems where woody encroachment is severe but where soil moisture and nutrient dynamics permit such hybrids.
3. Leverages emerging sensor technology and AI-driven models to optimize mowing schedules, thus ensuring adaptive management in the face of climate variability.
4. Incorporates soil type and moisture regime assessments into any management plan, recognizing that the outcomes of mowing, burning, or grazing are tightly coupled with these underlying abiotic factors.

This synthesis not only reinforces the vital role of mowing in grassland ecosystems but also lays out a roadmap for future adaptive strategies that balance ecological, operational, and socio-economic dimensions. With ongoing advances in agricultural technologies and a deeper understanding of ecosystem dynamics, mowing will likely remain an indispensable part of holistic grassland management regimes.
