# Final Report on the Effects of Soil Biota on Plant Diversity in Calcareous Soils in Central Europe

This report synthesizes empirical findings and theoretical insights on the interplay between soil biota and plant diversity in calcareous soils, with a focus on Central Europe. The report integrates learnings ranging from mechanistic interactions (e.g., mutualisms, pathogenic effects) to broader ecological patterns mediated by soil type, disturbance regimes, and land-use practices. The synthesis is organized into several sections: an overview of soil biota roles, spatial and temporal dynamics in calcareous landscapes, plant–soil feedback mechanisms, and implications for conservation management. Detailed discussions are provided below.

## 1. Introduction

Calcareous soils in Central Europe are characterized by high pH levels and significant calcium gradients, which in turn influence the physicochemical environment in which plants and soil organisms interact. These soils host unique plant communities, with vascular plant species richness being closely linked to soil pH and calcium content. Meanwhile, the soil biota—comprising fungal guilds (pathogenic, mycorrhizal, saprotrophic), bacteria, earthworms, and other microorganisms—exert profound control over plant productivity, diversity, and competitive dynamics. This report integrates multiple strands of research to elucidate the mechanistic pathways and broader ecological patterns associated with soil biota effects on plant diversity in these ecosystems.

## 2. Mechanistic Interactions: Fungal Guilds, Mutualisms, and Pathogens

### 2.1 Fungal Diversity and Density-Dependent Effects

Empirical research consistently shows that the diversity of fungal guilds plays a prominent role in modulating plant community dynamics through negative density-dependent effects. For instance, diverse fungal communities that include pathogenic, mycorrhizal, and saprotrophic species can regulate plant productivity by influencing both inter- and intraspecific competition. Negative density dependence occurs when high-density plant patches become more susceptible to disease or resource depletion mediated by specialized soil pathogens, thereby reducing competitive exclusion and facilitating a more diverse plant community.

> **Key Learning:** Empirical evidence indicates that fungal guild diversity—including pathogenic, mycorrhizal, and saprotrophic fungi—in temperate grasslands may drive negative density-dependent effects, modulating plant productivity and competitive dynamics.

### 2.2 Mutualistic and Pathogen-Driven Feedbacks

Plant–soil feedback studies reveal complex interactions between plant types and their associated soil biota. Specific mutualistic relationships, such as those formed with mycorrhizal fungi, enhance nutrient uptake and confer resilience against stressors, ultimately fostering higher plant diversity. In contrast, soil-borne pathogens (e.g., Rhizoctonia solani, along with bacterial genera such as Actinomyces, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas) can hinder plant growth and impact community composition by creating disease-suppressive soils in certain contexts. The dual role of soil biota—as both facilitators and inhibitors—is critical for understanding the balance of plant community dynamics in calcareous soils.

> **Key Learning:** Plant–soil feedback studies demonstrate that plant type and soil type interact in complex ways to shape microbial community structure, where both mutualistic symbionts and pathogenic organisms influence disease suppressiveness and thus plant diversity.

## 3. Broader Ecological Patterns: Disturbance, Land Use, and Microclimatic Influences

### 3.1 Soil Disturbance and Microclimatic Regulation

Calcareous soils are notably sensitive to both abiotic factors and disturbance regimes. Observational and experimental research spanning various latitudinal gradients (from southern Sweden to sites in Germany, Austria, and Spain) suggests that mechanical soil disturbances and variations in microclimatic conditions—especially water availability—play significant roles in dictating soil biocrust development as well as microbial and plant community responses. These disturbances modulate the physical support that soils provide, influencing factors such as PLFA biomarkers and microbial profiles.

> **Key Learning:** Research across a latitudinal gradient indicates that mechanical soil disturbance, along with microclimatic factors (notably water availability), significantly influences soil biocrust development, plant diversity, and microbial profiles in calcareous systems.

### 3.2 Regional Spatial Analyses and Pedodiversity

Advanced spatial analytic techniques, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and pedodiversity algorithms, highlight the importance of large-scale factors in shaping soil and vegetation patterns. Studies leveraging the European Soil Database V2.0 and Swiss vegetation data underscore that regional soil assemblages are a product of climatic conditions, geological substrates, and historical land management decisions. These findings are crucial, as they differentiate the biogeographical patterns between calcareous soils—often associated with calcicole flora—and non-calcareous substrates.

> **Key Learning:** Advanced spatial analyses reveal that regional soil assemblages across Europe are defined by climatic conditions, geological substrates, and historical land management practices, leading to distinct biogeographical patterns in calcareous versus non-calcareous soils.

### 3.3 Land Use and Vegetation Structural Dynamics

Land-use intensity and changes, particularly over historical timescales, have a decisive impact on calcareous grassy ecosystems. Comparative research in Southeast Belgium and Southeastern Germany highlights that, despite significant losses of calcareous habitats (up to 80% reduction in some areas since 1830), these landscapes remain biodiversity hotspots. Here, vegetation structure—characterized by aspects such as litter cover and xeric conditions—combined with spatial connectivity and past land-use practices, plays a more critical role in determining species diversity than do soil properties in isolation.

> **Key Learning:** Comparative research indicates that in calcareous grasslands, factors such as vegetation structure (litter cover, xericity), land use, and spatial connectivity are paramount in influencing species diversity, sometimes outweighing the direct influence of soil properties.

## 4. Successional Dynamics and Comparative Soil Studies

### 4.1 Early Successional Dynamics in Central European Landscapes

Successional studies in areas such as the Czech Republic provide insights into how plant colonization processes interact with soil biological parameters. Notably, early colonization on heterogeneous substrates (sand, peat, gray clay overburden) appears decoupled from the dynamics of soil biota. During these early phases, abiotic landscape factors such as exposure, moisture, and texture generally dominate. However, as soils mature, microbial biomass and extractable organic carbon begin to respond to the evolving physical and chemical properties of the substrate, indicating a delayed but significant influence on plant community assembly.

> **Key Learning:** In Central European sites, early plant colonization is largely decoupled from soil biological parameters, whereas later successional stages show a significant response of soil microbial biomass and organic carbon to substrate properties.

### 4.2 Systematic Phytosociological Surveys

Large-scale phytosociological surveys, such as those utilizing over 11,000 plots in the Czech Republic, consistently show that vascular plant species richness is highly sensitive to soil pH and calcium availability. This relationship underscores the distinct responses of calcicole (calcareous-loving) versus calcifuge (acidophilic) species, thereby providing a clear gradient along which soil properties drive vegetation patterns. Detailed surveys further help disentangle the contributions of soil biota by correlating variations in microbial diversity with these plant community gradients.

> **Key Learning:** Extensive phytosociological surveys have demonstrated a strong linkage between soil pH, calcium gradients, and vascular plant species richness, reinforcing the divergence between calcicole and calcifuge responses in Central Europe.

## 5. Conservation Practices, Soil Management, and Implications for Biodiversity

### 5.1 Impacts of Conservation Practices on Soil Biota

European field experiments (n > 60) have provided robust data on how modified agricultural practices influence soil biota. Non-inversion or no-till systems, as well as organic amendments such as compost, manure, and slurry, result in significant gains in soil biotic abundance and activity. Specifically, earthworm densities have been observed to increase by 56–125% under reduced tillage regimes and by 63–151% when organic amendments are applied. Similarly, microbial biomass carbon responds positively with increases of approximately 10–30% for tillage modifications and 25–31% with organic inputs. These practices contribute not only to soil health, but also indirectly support higher plant diversity through improved nutrient cycling and disease suppression.

> **Key Learning:** Multiyear experiments indicate that conservation practices, including non-inversion tillage and the application of organic amendments, yield significant increases in earthworm densities and microbial biomass across diverse conditions, independent of soil texture or climate.

### 5.2 Comparative Analyses with Non-Calcareous Soils

While the primary focus of this synthesis is on calcareous soils, comparisons with non-calcareous systems offer valuable contextual insights. Even in calcareous settings, abiotic disturbances—coupled with historical plant community structures—affect both mutualistic and pathogen-driven interactions. Large-scale surveys report microbial diversity measurements with as many as 79,000 bacterial OTUs and 25,000 fungal OTUs, evidencing that even subtle differences in soil disturbance can lead to significant shifts in microbial community composition. This reinforces the importance of integrated soil management strategies that account for the unique challenges posed by calcareous substrates.

> **Key Learning:** Large-scale surveys emphasize that microbial diversity is significantly sensitive to soil disturbance, illustrating that even calcareous soils exhibit marked shifts in microbial communities when exposed to differing disturbance regimes and historical land use.

## 6. Synthesis and Future Directions

### 6.1 Integration of Mechanistic and Broad-Scale Perspectives

The interactions between soil biota and plant diversity in calcareous soils are multifaceted. Mechanistically, fungal guild diversity and plant–soil feedbacks are central to modulating competitive dynamics and nutrient uptake. On a broader scale, extrinsic factors—such as soil disturbance, microclimatic variability, and land-use history—shape both the biological and physical dimensions of these ecosystems. An integrated approach that combines detailed mechanistic studies with large-scale spatial and temporal analyses provides the most promising pathway to fully understand and manage these ecosystems.

### 6.2 Emerging Research and Unexplored Dimensions

Emerging technologies such as high-throughput sequencing, advanced GIS analyses, and novel field experimental designs (e.g., long-term microcosm setups) are opening new avenues for research. Future studies would benefit from:

- **Systematic Integration of Multitrophic Interactions:** Further research is needed on the complex interactions between soil mesofauna, microbial communities, and plant roots under varying calcareous soil conditions.
- **Longitudinal Analyses and Experimental Rip Tests:** Extended temporal studies should be implemented to track how early successional decoupling of soil biota and plant communities evolves into integrated, functioning ecosystems.
- **Comparative Analyses across Soil Types:** Systematically comparing calcareous soils with acidic or neutral soils can elucidate the differential impacts of soil biota under varying chemical conditions. This could be enhanced by controlled manipulative experiments in both laboratory and field settings.
- **Adaptive Management Strategies:** Understanding the interplay between soil disturbance and biodiversity requires refinement of conservation strategies. Novel practices, potentially integrating precision agriculture and site-specific organic amendment regimes, should be evaluated for their long-term benefits to both soil biota and plant diversity.

### 6.3 Policy and Management Implications

The evidence presented calls for informed policy decisions that acknowledge the nuanced role of soil biota in ecosystem dynamics. Management practices that preserve or enhance soil microbial and faunal communities have direct benefits for plant diversity and broader ecosystem services. Policy frameworks should emphasize:

- **Conservation and Restoration Initiatives:** Protection of calcareous grasslands as biodiversity hotspots is critical, especially in regions suffering from extensive habitat loss.
- **Sustainable Land Management:** Integrating organic amendments and reduced-tillage practices in agricultural policies can lead to enhanced soil health and biodiversity conservation in calcareous systems.
- **Multidisciplinary Research Funding:** Investment in research that combines microbial ecology, plant physiology, and spatial analysis is essential to develop well-rounded, adaptive management strategies.

## 7. Conclusion

The effects of soil biota on plant diversity in calcareous soils in Central Europe are governed by a complex interplay of mechanistic, environmental, and historical factors. From fungal guild diversity modulating negative density-dependent effects to the impacts of conservation practices altering soil microbial communities, the interactions at play range widely across scales and temporal frameworks. Importantly, integrating spatial analyses with traditional field studies has provided a more comprehensive understanding of how soil disturbances, land use, and microclimatic conditions shape these interactions.

Future research directions must strive to integrate multifaceted experimental approaches and advanced analytical techniques to fully unravel these complex dynamics. In doing so, both ecosystem management practices and policy frameworks will be better informed, ultimately leading to more sustainable conservation outcomes that maintain both soil health and plant diversity.

This report provides a detailed synthesis of the current understanding derived from extensive empirical studies and observational data. As research continues to advance, it is anticipated that additional layers of complexity, such as genetic diversity within soil biota and their direct evolutionary impacts on plant communities, will further refine these models and management strategies.
