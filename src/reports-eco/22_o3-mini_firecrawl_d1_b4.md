# Final Report: The Impact of Snack Provision on Volunteer Retention

## Executive Summary

This report explores whether providing snacks as a tangible benefit increases the likelihood that a volunteer returns to volunteer again. Based on diverse academic, organizational, and applied research findings, the analysis synthesizes insights from studies on volunteer management, employee engagement, and hospitality practices. While evidence shows that management quality, recognition, and operational logistics strongly impact volunteer retention, the direct and causal role of providing small tangible incentives—like snacks—remains underexplored. This report reviews theoretical frameworks, empirical evidence, and real-world examples, and proposes potential experimental designs to address this gap.

## 1. Introduction and Context

Volunteer programs are the lifeblood of many community and nonprofit organizations. With increasing competition for time and volunteer engagement, organizations are refining their management approaches to maximize repeat participation and long-term commitment. Existing literature reveals that optimal volunteer experiences are derived from a combination of good organizational culture, recognition, and supportive logistical structures. A minor, yet possibly influential, factor in this equation is the provision of tangible benefits such as snacks during volunteer activities.

### 1.1. Scope of the Inquiry

The core inquiry asks: "Does providing snacks increase the chance that a volunteer returns to volunteer again?" Understanding this relationship requires a multi-layered approach:

- **Volunteer Context:** Although the prompt did not specify if the focus was on short-term events or ongoing commitments, previous research indicates that both contexts benefit from a positive, immediate incentive that can improve short-term retention while reinforcing a deeper sense of belonging.
- **Causality vs. Correlation:** The ultimate goal would be to establish a causal relationship, but current evidence is more correlational, highlighting the need for well-controlled, experimental or quasi-experimental studies.
- **Controlling Factors:** Additional variables like volunteer demographics, organizational culture, and overall participant satisfaction must be integrated into the analysis to reliably assess the role of snack provision.

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.1 Volunteer Motivation and Engagement

Existing frameworks like the Volunteer Function Inventory (VFI) and psychological capital theories emphasize the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations behind volunteering. Most of the currently established research highlights:

- **Intrinsic Motivation and Recognition:** Volunteers are motivated by the satisfaction of contributing to a cause, the recognition they receive, and an expressed sense of belonging. Studies, such as Keri VanOverschelde’s doctoral work, demonstrate how age, gender, and socio-economic backgrounds interact to affect these motivational factors.
- **Operational and Logistical Influences:** Apart from leadership quality and task design, logistical benefits (e.g., efficient scheduling and organized training) are understood to offer a reinforcing mechanism. Snacks, though not always the focus of research, represent a supplementary logistical benefit that might enhance these operational qualities.

### 2.2 Social Capital and Community Building

Research by Chiu et al. (2023) underscores the importance of creating environments that bolster social capital—structural, resource-based, and relational. Providing snacks is more than a nutritional benefit; it fosters social interaction, peer bonding, and can contribute to overall work engagement and mental well-being. In sports events and community programs, such benefits lead to measurable improvements in volunteers' physiological and psychological health, indirectly enhancing their commitment to the organization.

### 2.3 The Role of Tangible Incentives

While tangible benefits, including snacks and meals, are standard in many volunteer and afterschool programs, no study leads with a primary focus on their direct effect on repeat volunteer participation. However, organizational behavior research suggests that small gestures of appreciation can trigger a positive experience that carries forward, thereby increasing retention levels. Anecdotal evidence, supported by NCVO and similar bodies, indicates that the presence of even small amenities correlates with higher volunteer satisfaction and a greater sense of inclusion and recognition.

## 3. Empirical Evidence and Learnings

### 3.1 Quantitative and Qualitative Findings

There has been a convergence in evidence from diverse settings:

- **Lessons from Afterschool Programs:** For instance, afterschool meal initiatives that include snack options have shown a 5–6% rise in participation compared to previous years. Although these figures primarily focus on child engagement, they offer indirectly transferable insights regarding the attraction of recurrent participation among adults.

- **Social Engagement and Peer Relationships:** Reports indicate that in volunteer programs, especially those tied to employee volunteering, the integration of tangible extras like snacks can indirectly trigger improved social interactions, leading to outcomes such as an 85% rate of friendship formation among participants and reduced turnover.

### 3.2 Identified Research Gaps

Despite these encouraging trends, the literature has notable gaps:

- **Causal Impact:** No experiments or quasi‐experimental studies currently exist that isolate snack provision as an independent variable to determine its causal effect on volunteer retention.
- **Measurement Tools:** Most studies have used instruments like the MLQ (Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire), UWES (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale), and OCQ (Organizational Commitment Questionnaire) focusing on psychological factors. Tangible incentives like refreshments have not been prominently featured in such scales.
- **Demographic and Cultural Diversity:** Volunteer experiences can vary widely with demographics; NCVO studies highlight that global majority volunteers particularly value recognition and diversity. Integrating demographic considerations into future study designs could help tease out nuanced impacts of snack provision across different volunteer populations.

### 3.3 Comparative Examples

- **Employee Volunteer Programs:** Studies document that engaged employees, when provided with supplemental perks, exhibit 57% more effort and are 87% less likely to resign. This suggests that minor incentives—snacks in our case—could similarly bolster volunteer re-engagement by reinforcing an overall positive experience.

- **Event-Specific Studies:** Research in environments such as sports events shows that optimized working conditions and small benefits lead to improved mental and physical well-being, with incremental increases (e.g., 8.54% for mental health improvements). Although these benefits are not directly linked with the repeat participation metric, they underscore the interconnectedness of physical well-being, satisfaction, and commitment.

## 4. Practical Implications and Implementation

### 4.1 Operational Recommendations

Given the insights derived from the research, several operational recommendations can be put forward:

- **Integrated Volunteer Management:** Adopt comprehensive volunteer engagement strategies that combine operational logistics (structured training and clear scheduling), leadership practices (transformational leadership and recognition), and tangible benefits (such as snack provision). This integrated approach optimizes the overall positive experience.

- **Pilot Intervention Studies:** Organizations may design pilot studies that introduce snack provision as an experimental variable. Such interventions can compare renewal rates between groups that receive snacks versus those that do not, while controlling for demographic variables, culture, and event satisfaction.

- **Tailoring by Demographics:** As shown in VanOverschelde’s research, age and gender interact in unique ways with motivational drivers. Tailoring snack options—considering cultural preferences and dietary choices—could further enhance the perceived value of these benefits, particularly for global majority volunteers.

### 4.2 Research Design Considerations

For researchers aiming to bridge the identified gaps, consider the following possibilities:

- **Controlled Randomized Trials:** Implement randomized controlled trials in volunteer settings across diverse sectors (e.g., sports, afterschool programs, community service events) to isolate the effect of snack provision from other confounding factors.

- **Mixed Methods Approaches:** Use both quantitative surveys (employing scales that capture psychological engagement as well as logistical satisfaction) and qualitative interviews to understand volunteer perceptions in depth.

- **Longitudinal Studies:** Given that retention might be influenced over time, longitudinal studies could track volunteer commitment over months or years after initial interventions. This would help determine if early positive experiences, bolstered by tangible incentives, have lasting impacts.

- **Cultural and Geographic Variability:** Designing interventions that include culturally diverse volunteers across different geographic regions will clarify whether the effect is universally applicable or context-specific.

### 4.3 Unexplored and Contrarian Approaches

- **Behavioral Economic Experiments:** Consider a behavioral economics approach where the snack provision is framed not just as a free meal but as part of a reward system. This could involve gamification where points are earned for participation leading to tangible perks.

- **Digital Integration:** With digital engagement on the rise, exploring the synergy between online volunteer coordination and offline benefits (snacks at events) might provide insights into hybrid engagement models. For instance, an app that tracks volunteer hours could reward participants with coupons redeemable for snacks at events.

- **Psychological Ownership:** Another contrarian idea is to test whether involvement in snack selection (e.g., letting volunteers vote on snack choices) enhances a sense of ownership and agency, thus further reinforcing commitment to the organization.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Directions

To summarize, while current research robustly supports the importance of management practices, recognition, and logistical support in volunteer retention, the specific impact of snack provision on repeat volunteer behavior remains an understudied yet promising area. The following key points warrant emphasis:

- Establish a causal link: Future research should prioritize controlled experimental designs to tease out the direct effects of snack provision, moving beyond correlation to ascertain causality.
- Context matters: Volunteer retention is multifaceted; thus, any study on snack provision should control for variables such as demographics, overall experience quality, and the nature of the volunteer commitment.
- Incremental benefits: Although snack provision is a minor amenity, when combined with broader volunteer management practices, it has the potential to enhance social capital, improve experiences, and potentially increase retention rates.
- Methodological diversity: Employing mixed methods, interdisciplinary approaches, and innovative designs (such as digital-physical integrations) can provide a more comprehensive understanding of how tangible incentives operate within the volunteer ecosystem.

In conclusion, while direct experimental evidence on the effect of snacks on volunteer return rates is lacking, the convergence of related research suggests that such tangible benefits could play a supportive role in enhancing volunteer experiences. Organizations and researchers are encouraged to further explore this area with rigorous methodologies to provide actionable data that can inform policy and operational practice.
