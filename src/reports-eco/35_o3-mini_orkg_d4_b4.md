## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The BEF concept has evolved significantly since its early conceptualizations in grassland ecosystems. In non‐grassland systems such as forests, wetlands, marine ecosystems, and deserts, recent research highlights that the interplay between species, functional, and genetic diversity underpins ecosystem functionality through complex and nonlinear interactions. This report synthesizes findings from multi-disciplinary studies to integrate empirical, theoretical, and technological advances. Our objective is to cover mechanisms such as microclimatic buffering, trophic interactions, facilitation, and stress gradients, and to address challenges in extrapolating small-scale experimental results to landscape and global scales.

## 2. Environmental Stress Gradients and Nonlinear BEF Responses <a name="environmental-stress-gradients"></a>

Many studies have revealed that BEF responses along environmental stress gradients exhibit nonlinear, often unimodal, patterns. Key findings include:

- **Unimodal BEF Relationships:** At intermediate stress levels, species interactions shift, optimizing complementarity and compensatory dynamics. This results in enhanced ecosystem function, as observed in global analyses and controlled experiments in temperate rock pools and desert systems.

- **Role of Abiotic Stress:** Extreme abiotic conditions, as seen in arid and hydric ecosystems, modulate the trade-off between facilitation (e.g., microclimate amelioration) and inhibition (e.g., resource scarcity), which varies among ecosystems. For instance, desert and dryland systems reveal peak functional impacts at intermediate stress, while wetlands benefit from enhanced nutrient cycling under moderated stress.

- **Legacy Effects and Trophic Pathways:** Long-lasting belowground effects due to lower mobility of soil organisms and changes in trophic interactions contribute to resilience and variability in ecosystem functions. Evidence indicates that legacy biotic interactions play a critical role in shaping BEF relationships across multiple systems.

## 3. Mechanisms in Forest Ecosystems <a name="forest-ecosystems"></a>

Forests represent complex systems where biodiversity influences a wide range of ecophysiological processes, from microclimatic buffering to carbon allocation. Recent research converges on several key mechanisms:

### 3.1 Species Composition and Microclimatic Buffering <a name="species-composition"></a>

- **Mixed-Species Plantations:** Studies involving tree species such as Larix x eurolepis, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Betula pendula, and Pinus sylvestris have demonstrated that optimized species mixtures enhance canopy cover, thereby amplifying thermal buffering effects. Forest canopy cover is a critical modulator of local water balance and helps mitigate macroclimatic warming.

- **Forest Fragmentation and Edge Effects:** Edge effects, as observed in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, underscore how fragmentation can expose forest interiors to altered microclimates, reducing resilience. The integration of fine-scale measurements (e.g., through terrestrial LiDAR and high-resolution sensors) is vital for accurately capturing these microclimatic dynamics.

### 3.2 Functional and Genetic Diversity in Restoration and Resilience <a name="functional-genetic-forest"></a>

- **Influence of Functional Traits:** Integrated trait‐based approaches, including indices based on functional groups, dendrograms, and continuous trait measurements (e.g., specific leaf area, tree height), outperform simple species richness indices. They capture differences in ecosystem functions like productivity, nutrient cycling, and water availability.

- **Genetic Diversity as Stress Indicator:** DNA profiling and genetic trait metrics have emerged as sensitive measures of stress, linking reduced genetic variability with anthropogenic disturbances. Such genetic insights can be coupled with ecosystem models to generate spatial predictions of net carbon budgets and restoration success.

- **Restoration Strategies:** Forest restoration projects now incorporate advanced decision-support tools built on hierarchical comparative ecosystem analysis. These models integrate both above- and below-ground dynamics, encompassing biogeochemical cycles, canopy architectures, and long-term legacy effects.

### 3.3 Integration of Aboveground–Belowground Processes <a name="above-below"></a>

- **Coupling of Processes:** A key innovation in forest BEF analysis is the integration across scales of aboveground and belowground processes. Ultimately, whole-ecosystem experiments (with 225 European temperate forest plots, for example) illustrate how canopy metrics and soil buffering interact to influence ecosystem function.

- **Multitrophic Interactions:** Incorporating interaction networks and eco-evolutionary dynamics, recent studies emphasize that mixtures of plant and microbial communities combine to drive phenomena such as soil nutrient cycling, pathogen dilution, and drought resilience.

---

## 4. BEF Dynamics in Wetlands and Coastal Ecosystems <a name="wetland-ecosystems"></a>

Coastal wetlands (including restored salt marshes) offer unique insights into BEF relationships under hydric conditions:

- **Species and Functional Diversity:** Elevated plant species diversity in wetlands is linked to enhanced ecological functions such as percent vegetation cover, recruit species richness, and variability in key functional traits (e.g., photosynthetic rates and leaf mass per area).

- **Soil Nutrient Cycling and Microbial Processes:** Functional diversity significantly boosts microbial denitrification, especially under conditions of greater resource availability. This implies that both abiotic factors (e.g., elevation and soil nutrient profiles) and biotic components (diversity-mediated facilitation) work synergistically to enhance ecosystem functions.

- **Restoration and Management:** Quantitative approaches in coastal wetlands now employ data from in situ platforms and remote sensing to monitor ecosystem health, emphasizing the role of facilitatory processes like microclimate amelioration and nutrient cycling in sustaining ecosystem multifunctionality.

---

## 5. Marine Ecosystems: Monitoring and Multitrophic Interactions <a name="marine-ecosystems"></a>

Marine ecosystems present special challenges for assessing BEF due to their inherent dynamism and the difficulty of directly measuring key biological components.

- **Long-term Time Series and Minimalistic Observation:** Comparative frameworks from long-term marine studies demonstrate that even minimalistic observational setups can be effective in capturing ecosystem responses to global change. Recent campaigns (e.g., OSCAHR 2015, PROTEVSMED-SWOT 2018, FUMSECK 2019) have successfully integrated high-resolution remote sensing with in situ microsensor arrays.

- **Multiscale Hierarchical Analyses:** A hierarchical comparative framework—including within-ecosystem and cross-ecosystem comparisons—facilitates the identification of key processes that regulate biodiversity, productivity, and resilience in marine systems.

- **Sensor Innovations:** Advances in ocean in situ sensor technology (like lab-on-a-chip systems and microfluidic instruments) have enabled single-cell resolution of microbial behaviors and gene expression patterns, dramatically reducing costs and increasing spatial-temporal resolution of measurements.

- **Energy Flux and Trophic Complementarity:** Emerging approaches focusing on energy flux measurements in marine food webs highlight the importance of network energetics, linking biodiversity to ecosystem functions such as primary production and nutrient recycling.

---

## 6. Desert and Arid Systems: Stress, Trait Complementarity, and Facilitation <a name="desert-systems"></a>

Desert ecosystems offer a distinct perspective where extreme abiotic conditions impose a strong selection on biodiversity and functioning:

- **Unimodal Responses Under Extreme Stress:** Global datasets indicate that under desert-like conditions, BEF relationships exhibit unimodal patterns where intermediate stress maximizes function. This has been attributed to shifts in species interactions, compensatory dynamics, and nonlinear trophic feedbacks.

- **Trait-Based Mechanisms:** Integrated trait analyses, especially those evaluating size, leaf characteristics, and root dynamics, have proven to explain a substantial portion of the variability in ecosystem multifunctionality. In arid environments, trait identities and multi-trait complementarity become critical in driving ecosystem responses.

- **Facilitative Mechanisms:** Nurse plant effects, microclimate amelioration, and enhanced soil nutrient cycling have been observed in desert communities. Such facilitative processes potentially double species richness and significantly boost ecosystem cover, underscoring their importance in sustaining desert ecosystems.

---

## 7. Scale Dependence and Spatial Heterogeneity <a name="scale-dependence"></a>

One of the most challenging aspects in BEF research has been reconciling processes at different spatial and temporal scales:

- **Nonlinear Scaling Effects:** Empirical and simulation studies (e.g., Cedar Creek grassland experiments) show that local variations in species diversity (α-diversity) and spatial heterogeneity drive nonlinear scaling of the BEF slope. In many cases, aggregated regional measurements display moderate to strong increases in BEF slopes due to these heterogeneities.

- **Landscape-Level Variability:** Restored ecosystems and human-modified landscapes demonstrate that landscape composition can explain a significantly larger portion of multifunctionality variance than plant diversity alone. Detailed analyses using high-resolution remote sensing (e.g., MODIS, Sentinel) coupled with in situ calibration reveal important thresholds and discontinuities in carbon dynamics and microclimate buffering.

- **Metacommunity Connectivity:** Spatial aggregation and incomplete species turnover among patches further complicate BEF interpretation. Connectivity dynamics within metacommunities help mediate ecological functions and stability across landscapes, thereby demanding novel modeling approaches that explicitly address cross-scale feedbacks.

---

## 8. Integrative Modeling Approaches and Technological Advances <a name="modeling-and-technology"></a>

Advances in modeling and sensor technology have provided powerful insights into BEF dynamics:

- **Process-Based and Hierarchical Models:** Models such as SECRETS, GORCAM, and ACRONYM integrate biogeochemical cycles, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and nutrient balances to simulate ecosystem responses across scales. These frameworks bridge microscale observations with broader landscape patterns and inform sustainable management planning.

- **Sensor Fusion and Autonomous Platforms:** The integration of fixed observatories, mobile robotics, and free-drifting devices has significantly enhanced the spatial and temporal resolution of BEF monitoring. In both terrestrial (e.g., airborne LiDAR capturing understory temperature buffering) and marine systems (e.g., lab-on-a-chip microsensors), these platforms ensure the capture of heterogeneous data critical for advanced model assimilation.

- **Advanced Data Assimilation Techniques:** The use of multivariate and multiscale data assimilation methods (EnKF, particle filtering, 3/4D-VAR) has reduced uncertainty in model predictions. Integrating heterogeneous datasets, from high-frequency in situ sensors to satellite remote sensing, is pivotal for reconciling differential spatial scales and for robust model calibration.

- **Cost-Effective Innovations:** Recent breakthroughs have led to cost reductions—up to threefold—in sensor technology via miniaturization and mass production. This not only broadens the spatial coverage of sensors, particularly in under-explored regions, but also accelerates the transition from experimental setups to operational monitoring networks.

---

## 9. Synthesis of Multitrophic and Cross-Scale Dynamics <a name="multitrophic-dynamics"></a>

Integrating processes across multiple trophic levels, spatial domains, and temporal scales remains the frontier in BEF research:

- **Multitrophic Perspectives:** Joint modeling of animal and plant functional traits (e.g., foraging behavior, body size, leaf traits) has refined our understanding of how trophic interactions and trait complementarity drive ecosystem functions like primary production, decomposition, and soil carbon sequestration. The emerging concept of trophic complementarity emphasizes interaction diversity and network structure as universal drivers of ecosystem functioning.

- **Cross-Scale Coupling:** The integration of microscale sensor data (including single-cell measurements of microbial processes) with landscape-scale remote sensing underscores the necessity to link fast, transient phenomena with long-term, ecosystem-wide responses. This multi-scale approach is particularly important for deciphering feedback loops between facilitative interactions, resource partitioning, and abiotic drivers such as topography and soil nutrient heterogeneity.

- **Socioecological Tradeoffs:** Recent studies emphasize that BEF relationships must also account for socioecological tradeoffs. For instance, forest restoration projects now quantitatively address conflicts between carbon sequestration, biodiversity maintenance, and economic objectives through spatial optimization analyses, such as production possibility frontiers.

## 10. Conclusions and Future Directions <a name="conclusions"></a>

The synthesis of recent research on BEF mechanisms in non‐grassland ecosystems reveals the following take-home messages:

1. **Nonlinear and Scale-Dependent Interactions:** Environmental stress gradients, spatial heterogeneity, and trophic networks drive nonlinear BEF responses that vary across forest, wetland, marine, and desert systems. Understanding these patterns is critical for predicting ecosystem resilience under global change.

2. **Role of Functional and Genetic Diversity:** Beyond species richness, the integration of functional and genetic diversity metrics provides deeper insights into ecosystem functioning. Trait-based approaches, especially when coupled with precise measurements of canopy structure, microclimate, and soil processes, outperform traditional diversity metrics.

3. **Advancements in Sensor and Modeling Technologies:** The emergence of cost-effective, high-resolution sensor platforms, coupled with sophisticated data assimilation techniques and integrative process-based models, has dramatically improved our ability to capture and predict BEF dynamics. This synergy is leading to more reliable decision-support tools for ecosystem management and restoration.

4. **Integration Across Trophic Levels and Spatial Scales:** Bridging the gap between microscale processes and landscape-level patterns is essential. Multitrophic frameworks that integrate plant, microbial, and animal traits provide a universal metric (e.g., energy flux in food webs) to link biodiversity to ecosystem functionality.

5. **Future Research Needs:** Moving forward, a concerted effort is required to:
   - Expand hierarchical comparative analyses across diverse ecosystems and stress gradients.
   - Develop standardized methods for cross-scale model calibration and sensor fusion.
   - Further explore facilitative mechanisms (e.g., microclimate amelioration, pathogen dilution) that are emerging as key drivers of ecosystem function in non‐grassland systems.
   - Integrate socioecological dimensions into BEF frameworks to reconcile ecological resilience with human land use and economic priorities.

In summary, the BEF framework in non‐grassland ecosystems is rapidly evolving through interdisciplinary approaches that blend empirical experiments, theoretical models, and technological innovations. By embracing mechanisms at both micro- and macro-scales as well as integrating multitrophic perspectives, researchers and managers are better equipped to understand and sustain ecosystem multifunctionality in the face of rapid environmental change.

This comprehensive overview articulates the current state of BEF research and outlines pathways for future exploration. The complexities uncovered through integrating fine-scale sensor data, high‐resolution remote sensing, and advanced process-based modeling provide a robust framework for advancing both scientific understanding and practical stewardship of critical ecosystems worldwide.
