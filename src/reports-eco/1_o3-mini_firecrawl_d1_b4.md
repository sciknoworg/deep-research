# Final Report: The Effect of Management Extensification on Grassland Plant Diversity

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of how management extensification affects grassland plant diversity. Through a synthesis of multiple research findings, we explore the nuanced effects of reduced chemical inputs, changes in mowing frequency, adjustments in grazing pressure, and other management practices. Emphasis is placed on the trade-offs between ecosystem services, the variation in responses across different grassland ecosystems (temperate, Mediterranean, alpine, semi‐arid, and mountainous regions), and the role of integrated modeling in forecasting future dynamics. The report draws on a diverse body of empirical evidence, process‐based modeling studies, and advanced causal inference methods in order to provide a detailed understanding of the ecological processes underlying plant diversity changes in grasslands under extensified management.

## 1. Introduction

Grasslands are complex ecosystems where management practices significantly influence both productivity and biodiversity. Management extensification—defined here as reducing chemical inputs (e.g., fertilization), lowering mowing frequency, and moderating grazing pressure—has emerged as an alternative to intensification, which traditionally increases inputs to boost yield. While intensification often enhances provisioning services (such as increased biomass and forage quality), it frequently results in declines in species richness and compositional turnover. This report aims to address the following central question:

**What is the effect of management extensification on grassland plant diversity?**

The discussion integrates findings from various research efforts and frames them in the context of full ecosystem functionality, economic trade-offs, and long-term ecological dynamics.

## 2. Conceptual Framework and Integrated Modeling Approaches

### 2.1. Integrated Modeling: Combining PBMs with Socioeconomic Frameworks

A key finding in recent research is the necessity for integrated modeling approaches that combine Process-Based Models (PBMs) with human socioeconomic decision frameworks. These integrated models address the trade-offs between provisioning services (e.g., livestock yield) and regulating and cultural ecosystem services. In this framework, the models account for uncertainties and spatial heterogeneity—a critical component when assessing management practices across diverse ecological and climatic regions.

- **Ecological Models:** Capture general biodiversity patterns by incorporating species interactions and competition dynamics. They are useful for understanding complementarity effects in species richness.
- **Biogeochemical Models:** Provide detailed insights into nutrient and carbon cycling, particularly important when assessing the influence of reduced fertilization on soil health and plant nutrition.
- **Agricultural Models:** Highlight the balance between productivity and biodiversity, factoring in socioeconomic drivers such as farm size, cattle density, and regional climate variability.

This multi-dimensional modeling approach allows researchers to predict climate change impacts on grassland multifunctionality, offering a way to simulate various scenarios of management extensification and its ecological consequences.

### 2.2. Trade-offs and Multifunctionality in Grassland Ecosystems

Trade-offs are inherent in grassland management. Historical research indicates a consistent pattern: while provisioning services may benefit from intensification, biodiversity, including plant species richness, suffers. Extensification can often reverse these negative trends, but a thorough understanding of the spatial and temporal scaling of these effects is essential. For instance, reductions in mowing frequency and chemical inputs can enhance invertebrate abundance and slow down species loss, but at a potential cost in forage yield.

## 3. Effects of Specific Management Practices

### 3.1. Reduction of Chemical Inputs

Empirical evidence from multiple studies shows that reducing chemical inputs—especially the cessation or minimization of fertilization—results in increased plant diversity. The long-term impacts (extending up to 16 years post‐cessation) are characterized by:

- **Increased Species Richness:** Lower fertilizer input environments encourage the persistence of a higher diversity of plant species, allowing competitive species to be balanced by less dominant, slower-growing species.
- **Enhanced Invertebrate Abundance:** Lower chemical input regimes can lead to higher invertebrate populations, which in turn contribute to ecological processes like pollination and nutrient cycling.

The balance here is promising for conservation, though it may imply short-term shifts in productivity that require adaptive management practices.

### 3.2. Changes in Mowing Frequency

Management extensification often involves a deliberate reduction in mowing frequency. This practice offers notable biodiversity benefits but also comes with economic trade-offs:

- **Biodiversity Gains:** Data derived from causal inference frameworks employing generalized random forests and remote sensing (across regions like eastern Germany) reveal a heterogeneous but overall positive effect on plant species richness. Contextual drivers such as spring/summer temperature, precipitation, and socioeconomic factors modulate these effects.
- **Economic Trade-offs:** While reducing mowing intensity can lead to significant gains in biodiversity, spatially explicit studies indicate that forage yield may drop by an average of 1.8 tonnes per hectare. This reduction translates into an opportunity cost in monetary terms (estimated between 51 and 135 euros per hectare).

This dual outcome necessitates targeted agri-environment schemes to balance conservation goals with production needs. Areas showing pronounced biodiversity gains could be prioritized for incentive-based management adaptations.

### 3.3. Grazing Pressure Adjustments

Grazing management remains one of the most complex variables in grassland dynamics. Research indicates that the ecological impacts of grazing differ significantly when compared to mowing:

- **Short-term Grazing Dynamics:** Short-term exclusion of grazing can lead to rapid recovery and a temporary increase in plant species richness, particularly in humid grasslands. However, prolonged exclusion or extreme intensification can negatively impact evenness and diminish overall species diversity through competitive exclusion by dominant grasses.
- **Long-term Grazing vs. Mowing:** A semi‐arid grassland study in northeastern China illustrates that while increased mowing frequency decreased plant species richness by an average of 1.6 species per field, moderate cattle grazing maintained or, in some contexts, enhanced species richness. These results underscore that grazing and mowing, while both forms of disturbance, are not ecologically equivalent.

This nuanced distinction suggests that management strategies should carefully calibrate grazing intensity to optimize plant diversity while sustaining forage productivity.

### 3.4. Influence on Invertebrate and Other Taxonomic Groups

While the primary focus is plant diversity, other organisms are also affected by management changes. For example, long-term intensification of mountain hay meadows has been shown to decrease land snail species richness significantly (by approximately 35%), especially affecting mesophilous snails. Changes in these invertebrate communities are closely tied to microclimatic factors such as soil pH and moisture conditions. Thus, the broader ecological community—including both flora and fauna—responds to management practices in complex ways, reinforcing the need for all-encompassing ecosystem assessments.

## 4. Long-term and Short-term Ecological Dynamics

### 4.1. Temporal Dynamics and Legacy Effects

A critical aspect of management extensification is understanding both the immediate and legacy effects on plant diversity:

- **Short-term Responses:** Rapid changes are observed in moist, humid grasslands following adjustments in grazing or mowing frequency. These responses include temporary boosts in species richness, likely due to the release from competitive suppression and improved microhabitat variability.
- **Long-term Ecological Dynamics:** Over extended periods, however, persistent exclusion of disturbances or continuous low-input strategies may lead to homogenization of the plant community, marked by reduced evenness as competitive species gradually dominate. It is therefore essential to implement dynamic management strategies that account for both transient and persistent ecological changes.

### 4.2. New Approaches: Multi-Species Grass–Legume–Herb Mixtures

Recent studies have provided compelling evidence that multi-species mixtures under low-input conditions outperform high-input monocultures. The benefits include:

- **Transgressive Overyielding:** Mixtures often lead to higher overall biomass compared to what is predicted from component species grown in monoculture.
- **Improved Drought Resilience:** Diversified species compositions can mitigate the effects of drought and other climatic extremes better than monocultures.

These findings suggest that diversification of grassland plant communities, encouraged through management extensification, holds promise for reconciling production with biodiversity conservation. Such systems may also improve the adaptability of grasslands to climate change-induced stressors.

## 5. Process-Based Models (PBMs) and Their Limitations

Process-based models are instrumental in predicting both short and long-term ecological outcomes. PBMs are generally categorized into three types:

- **Ecological Models:** Evaluate species interactions and general patterns of biodiversity.
- **Biogeochemical Models:** Concentrate on nutrient and carbon cycling, critical in assessing the impacts of chemical input reduction.
- **Agricultural Models:** Focus on the balance between yield outputs and ecosystem services.

These models face several challenges, including the need to account for spatial heterogeneity, dynamic adaptation of species, and the multifaceted influence of management practices (e.g., grazing dynamics, mowing regimes) on plant diversity. Enhancing model diversity and incorporating uncertainty quantification remains a priority, particularly under scenarios of climate change.

## 6. Synthesis: Trade-offs and Policy Implications

### 6.1. Ecosystem Service Trade-offs

The collected research clearly indicates that management extensification influences a range of ecosystem services. For example:

- **Provisioning Services:** Intensification generally boosts yield despite common reductions in species richness, while extensification may enhance biodiversity but at a cost of reduced forage yield.
- **Regulating and Cultural Services:** Increased plant diversity under extensified management can improve ecosystem regulation (e.g., nutrient cycling, soil stabilization) and enhance cultural ecosystem services (e.g., landscape aesthetics, recreational use).

The quantification of yield losses (approximately 1.8 t/ha) and corresponding economic values (51–135 euros per ha) provides a strong framework for implementing cost-effective, targeted agri-environment schemes. Policymakers can use these figures to design incentive structures that both maintain agricultural productivity and conserve biodiversity.

### 6.2. Policy and Management Recommendations

Based on the reviewed research, several management and policy recommendations emerge:

1. **Adopt Integrated Management Frameworks:** Policies should encourage the use of integrated PBMs combined with socioeconomic decision frameworks to forecast and balance ecosystem multifunctionality.
2. **Promote Reduced Chemical Inputs:** Incentives to reduce fertilization can lead to sustained gains in biodiversity and associated invertebrate populations, vital for overall ecosystem resilience.
3. **Optimize Grazing and Mowing Practices:** Tailor grazing regimes and mowing frequencies to local climatic, soil, and socioeconomic conditions. This might involve promoting moderate grazing over intensive mowing in many regions.
4. **Encourage Diversified Plant Mixtures:** Implementing grass–legume–herb mixtures can lead to transgressive overyielding and enhanced drought resilience, reconciling conservation efforts with production needs.
5. **Spatially Targeted Management:** Leverage high-resolution remote sensing and causal inference frameworks to identify regions (such as northeastern Germany) where the biodiversity benefits of reduced mowing or altered grazing are maximized.

## 7. Conclusion

Management extensification offers a promising pathway for balancing the conservation of plant diversity with the economic imperatives of grassland use. The synthesis of research findings reveals that reducing chemical inputs, lowering mowing frequency, and calibrating grazing pressure can enhance plant species richness while also benefiting associated fauna such as invertebrates. Nevertheless, these benefits come with trade-offs in forage yield and require careful economic valuation and spatially explicit management approaches. Future research should continue to refine process-based models, incorporate spatial data, and explore innovative mixtures of plant species to further elucidate the optimal strategies in various grassland ecosystems.

The comprehensive integration of ecological, biogeochemical, and agricultural perspectives ensures that management extensification is not only ecologically viable but also economically and socially sustainable. Continued interdisciplinary research and adaptive management will be critical as grasslands face ongoing pressures from climate change and anthropogenic influences.
