## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

The rapid increase of lesser snow goose populations, amplified by agricultural intensification and extensive food subsidies between the 1960s and the mid-1990s, has significantly impacted Arctic coastal ecosystems. The ensuing landscape transformation—marked by vegetation biomass reductions (up to 61% in aboveground biomass) and alternative stable states—poses severe ecological challenges. Concurrently, Arctic indigenous communities, whose sustenance and livelihoods are intricately related to local environmental conditions, face potential threats to food security. Research has underlined the need to address the multifaceted dimensions of this issue:

- **Ecological Integrity:** How do overabundant snow goose populations modify the ecosystem dynamics, particularly in terms of vegetation cover and soil stability?
- **Food Security:** How can we protect and promote local food security for indigenous populations particularly reliant on native ecological resources?
- **Integrated Monitoring and Management:** What combination of technological and cultural approaches can be employed to effectively monitor goose populations while taking local socio-economic dynamics into account?

This report details a comprehensive management strategy informed by past learnings, recent technological advances, and socio-political context in Arctic regions.

## 2. Current Research Learnings

### 2.1 Ecological Dynamics and Agriculture-Driven Population Growth

Empirical research reveals that food subsidies and intensified agricultural production in temperate regions have fueled a relatively high annual increase (5–7% growth) in lesser snow goose populations. The downstream effects include:

- **Landscape Alteration:** Repeated grazing and foraging behavior by geese have led to drastic reductions in vegetation biomass. In certain areas, decreases of up to 61% have been observed, pushing ecosystems towards alternative stable states. Such transformations not only affect local flora but trigger ripple effects throughout food webs.
- **Energetic Models:** Studies involving individually tagged geese through indwelling heart-rate loggers have facilitated the development of energetic and spatial models, offering insight into the geese’s foraging behaviors and energy expenditures. This is pivotal in estimating carrying capacities and in the design of intervention strategies.

### 2.2 Integration of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Collaborative Management

Collaborative research projects, particularly in Nunavut and other Inuit-inhabited regions, have highlighted the significant role of Traditional Ecological Knowledge:

- **Co-Management Initiatives:** Indigenous communities have been actively involved in monitoring snow goose populations through co-management schemes. By leveraging TEK, these initiatives provide a refined understanding of local ecological cues, migratory patterns, and historical baselines which are not always captured by modern instruments.
- **Policy Innovations:** The incorporation of indigenous perspectives into governance models facilitates culturally sensitive management solutions. This collaboration has not only informed conservation strategies but also enabled the development of policies that safeguard indigenous food security while promoting ecosystem resilience.

### 2.3 Advanced Remote Sensing and Technological Monitoring

Recent advancements in remote sensing and tracking technologies have revolutionized ecological studies of Arctic geese:

- **Remote Observation Methods:** The utilization of technologies such as drone imagery, LANDSAT, and photogrammetry allows for high-resolution mapping of both goose populations and their habitat conditions. This data is critical for spatially explicit monitoring and for identifying areas of high ecological vulnerability.
- **Individual-Based Tracking:** The deployment of indwelling sensors and heart-rate loggers offers granular data on movement, energy expenditure, and behavioral shifts in response to environmental changes. These embedded systems enable predictive modeling that can inform proactive management measures.

## 3. Integrated Monitoring and Management Strategies

The complexities of managing snow goose populations require multi-pronged strategies that merge technology with socio-cultural frameworks. The following integrated approaches outline possible solutions:

### 3.1 Technological Integration and Monitoring Networks

#### A. Remote Sensing and GIS Mapping

- **Drone Surveillance and Satellite Imagery:** Establishing permanent surveillance systems employing drones and satellites (e.g., LANDSAT) facilitates near-real-time monitoring of habitat variations. This data can be overlaid onto GIS platforms to pinpoint areas of high geese concentration, forage depletion, and emerging ecosystem stress indicators.

- **Automated Image and Data Analysis:** Advances in machine learning algorithms can be harnessed to analyze high-resolution imagery. Automated detection of geese and mapping of vegetation changes will improve the rapid delivery of actionable insights.

#### B. Individual-Based Tracking Technologies

- **Bio-Logging Devices:** Expanding the use of indwelling heart-rate loggers and GPS trackers will allow for individualized movement mapping and energy expenditure analysis. These devices could be part of a larger sensor network to correlate behavioral data with environmental triggers, thereby enhancing the predictive capacity of models.

- **Data Fusion Systems:** Combining remote sensing outputs with bio-logging data through integrated data fusion systems offers a robust framework for real-time monitoring. This integration will help refine predictive models that can simulate scenarios under various intervention strategies.

### 3.2 Socio-Economic and Cultural Considerations

#### A. Empowerment through Traditional Knowledge

- **TEK Integration:** Actively involving indigenous elders and local experts in monitoring networks offers high-fidelity observational data. TEK not only enriches the ecological context but also helps tailor intervention strategies to local socio-cultural dynamics.

- **Capacity Building:** Training local community members in the usage of modern technological tools ensures sustainable and autonomous management. Empowering indigenous communities with data analysis capabilities mitigates dependency and fosters resilience in both ecological and socio-economic realms.

#### B. Policy Reformation and Co-Management Models

- **Redesigning Governance Structures:** Existing policy frameworks need to be revisited with an eye toward integrating TEK and modern ecological data. Embedding local knowledge within formal scientific and policy frameworks strengthens management credibility and ensures that policy changes reflect on-the-ground realities.

- **Incentivized Co-Management:** Creating economic incentives for communities to participate in ecological monitoring—through direct subsidies, resource management rights, or revenue-sharing models tied to sustainable practices—can bridge the gap between conservation imperatives and food security.

### 3.3 Innovative and Adaptive Management Approaches

#### A. Dynamic Intervention Strategies

- **Adaptive Management Framework:** An iterative framework that responds to real-time data feedback will be key. This involves continuous monitoring, stakeholder engagement, and the flexibility to modify management tactics promptly in reaction to ecological and socio-economic changes.

- **Scenario-Based Modeling:** Utilizing individual-based and spatial models, scenario analysis would forecast potential outcomes under varying environmental and policy conditions. This predictive tool supports preemptive adjustments in management measures and helps stakeholders visualize long-term trade-offs.

#### B. Transboundary and Interdisciplinary Collaboration

- **Regional Integration:** Given that snow goose populations do not adhere to political boundaries, regional cooperation among neighboring Arctic states is essential. Multi-national research initiatives integrating data sharing and policy harmonization can amplify the effectiveness of localized interventions.

- **One Health Approach:** Recognizing that ecosystem health, animal health, and human health are interdependent suggests the potential for a One Health framework. Incorporating perspectives from veterinary sciences, epidemiology, and human nutrition can open avenues for novel interventions that simultaneously address ecological imbalances and food security.
