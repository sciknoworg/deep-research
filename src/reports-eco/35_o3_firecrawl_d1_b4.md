# Mechanisms Driving the Biodiversity–Ecosystem‐Function (BEF) Relationship in Ecosystems Beyond Grasslands

*Prepared 2025-06-03*

## 1. Framing the Question
The grassland literature has historically underpinned BEF theory, emphasising complementarity and selection (Loreau & Hector 2001). Yet >80 % of the planet’s biomass, carbon stocks and biogeochemical fluxes occur in forests, freshwater, and marine realms.  Understanding their BEF mechanisms is urgent for climate mitigation, food security and bio-engineering.  Below is a synthetic, mechanistic tour across **temperate & boreal forests, tropical & subtropical forests, freshwater lakes/streams, coral reefs and the open ocean**.  Classic mechanisms are integrated with emerging ideas—**microbiome mediation, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, landscape connectivity and trait–soil feedbacks**.  Each section closes with research gaps and management leverage points the primary literature or previous syntheses have not yet fully articulated.

## 2. Forest Ecosystems
### 2.1 Trait–Driven Complementarity, but with Context-Dependent Signals
1. **Continental-scale inventory, eastern USA (1.8 M trees; 23 k plots)**  
   • Simple species richness explained wood productivity as well as functional or phylogenetic diversity (partial R² ≈ 1.6 %).  
   • Trait/phylo metrics *independent* of richness were **negatively** associated with productivity—suggesting that **trait packing/redundancy** (dense niche packing) rather than divergence underpins growth at ~1 km² grain.  
   • Mechanistic reading: light capture and hydraulic safety may saturate quickly; additional trait divergence can introduce sub-optimal strategies that lower stand-level increment.

2. **Functional trait–soil carbon link (454 temperate/boreal stands, 33 traits)**  
   • Conservative leaf & wood traits (high LDMC, high WD) raised soil organic carbon (SOC) by up to 20 Mg C ha⁻¹ but only on acidic, coarse soils.  
   • This shows **traits modify litter quality and rhizodeposition**, affecting microbial processing rates and stabilisation—classical ‘litter quality → SOC’ pathway.

3. **Ectomycorrhizal (EcM) dominance in NE-China (4 k plots)**  
   • Each 10 % rise in EcM basal area added 3.6 Mg C ha⁻¹ soil C.  Effects amplified under climate stress and low richness.  
   • Mechanism: EcM fungi produce recalcitrant mycelium and suppress saprotrophs (Gadgil effect), slowing decomposition; they also access organic N, reallocating photosynthate below-ground.  
   • Implies **symbiosis type** is a first-order BEF axis, orthogonal to taxonomic diversity.

4. **Dry-subhumid Canadian forests (2 491 plots, 1958-2015)**  
   • Increasing functional diversity mitigated ~50 % of the productivity loss from warming and aridification.  
   • Points to **response diversity**: different hydraulic, phenological strategies buffer against climate shocks.

**Synthesis for forests**  
• At local scales (≤1 ha) **niche complementarity** remains detectable, but at meso- to macro- scales, **redundancy** and **symbiont filtering** step forward.  
• Functional trait spectra and below-ground mutualists (mycorrhizas) jointly control carbon sequestration; *who* the partners are may matter more than *how many* partners exist in stressful environments.  

**Outstanding gaps / proposed work**  
1. **Trait–mycorrhiza interaction experiments** manipulating EcM vs AM vs ERM tree mixes under warming × drought to quantify additive vs non-additive C-flux responses.  
2. Forest Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) should parameterise *symbiont functional types* to capture observed 3–8 Mg C ha⁻¹ stock shifts.  
3. **Speculative**: test whether *endophytic microbiome transfer* from conservative to acquisitive trees can partially substitute for trait effects on SOC.

## 3. Freshwater Lakes & Streams
### 3.1 Eco-Evolutionary Feedbacks (EEF)
The **alewife–zooplankton system** showcases rapid evolution shaping ecosystem fluxes (Post & Palkovacs 2009):  
• Landlocked alewife evolve gill-raker spacing and foraging behaviour within decades, altering zooplankton size spectra.  
• This restructures phytoplankton grazing pressure, changing primary production and nutrient recycling—an EEF loop.  
**Implication:** BEF in lakes can hinge on intraspecific genetic diversity, not just species counts.

### 3.2 Hydrological & Landscape Connectivity
1. **Connectivity blueprint (Ormerod et al. 2011)** formalised four connectivity axes (longitudinal, lateral, vertical, temporal) and proposed a **dendritic connectivity index**.  
   • Fragmentation (frequency × impassability) interacts with biodiversity to affect nutrient spiralling and fishery yields.

2. **Yangtze floodplain lakes (9-year biomonitoring)**  
   • Despite water quality improvements, macroinvertebrate taxonomic *and* functional diversity declined.  
   • Land-use within 0.05–5 km buffers explained ≥25 % of variance; connectivity modulated stressor pathways: the more connected Lake Dongting showed larger spatial influence radii.  
   • Mechanism: **cross-scale subsidies** (DOC, propagules) require hydrological pathways; severing them reduces the realised niche space and dampens function.

**Leverage points not widely discussed**  
• Implement **adaptive culvert retrofits** that include flow-pulse variability, preserving vertical + temporal connectivity, not just fish passage.  
• Use **focal-species trait filtering (e.g., gill morphology, dispersal mode)** to anticipate which taxa drive nutrient spirals under altered flow regimes.

## 4. Marine & Coral Reef Systems
### 4.1 Microbiome Mediation of BEF
1. **‘Microbiome stewardship’ paradigm**  
   • Moves from single probiotic strains to **designed multi-species consortia** via DBTL (design–build–test–learn) pipelines.  
   • Demonstrated functions:   
     – Heat-tolerant tissue homogenates reduced *Pocillopora* bleaching at 34 °C.  
     – Oil-degrading consortia removed PAHs and shielded *Mussismilia harttii*.  
     – Phage BA3 halted *Thalassomonas* white-plague; **Halobacteriovorax** predators suppressed *Vibrio coralliilyticus*.

2. **Tara Pacific (99 reefs)**  
   • 542 k prokaryotic ASVs; microbiome composition driven 2–3× more by geographic distance than by local environment.  
   • Coral morphotypes display distinct microbial biogeography decoupled from host phylogeny—implying **host-microbiome trait complementarity** supersedes host taxonomy in driving function.

3. **Concepts of ‘beneficiome’ vs ‘pathobiome’**  
   • Baseline reef function (photosynthate transfer, N-fixation, DMSP cycling) depends on flexible microbial assemblages; climate change erodes this flexibility.  

**Mechanistic summary**  
• **Facilitation** is microbial: microbes buffer hosts against thermal, pollutant and disease stress, maintaining reef calcification and carbonate budget.  
• BEF extends to multi-kingdom networks; diversity of *functions*—heat tolerance, ROS scavenging, heterotrophy—rather than taxa per se govern outcome.

**Management & research frontiers**  
1. Integrate microbiome metrics into **reef health scorecards**, weighting ASV-level functional redundancy over taxonomic richness.  
2. **Speculative:** Deploy **CRISPR-based barcoding** to track probiotic strains’ persistence and horizontal gene transfer risk.  
3. Formalise policy for **microbiome restoration permits**, akin to coral transplantation regulations.

## 5. Cross-Ecosystem Insights: Stress Gradients & Global Change
### 5.1 Stress Amplifies the Biodiversity Effect
A factorial synthesis of 46 experiments (microbes–plants) found **positive net biodiversity effects (NBE) in 100 % of cases**, with **ΔNBE increasing with stress intensity** (warming, drought, N, CO₂).  Complementarity—not selection—scaled positively through time.

Interpretation:
• Stressors open niche space or impose fluctuating selection, enhancing **temporal niche partitioning**.  
• Diverse communities maintain function via a *portfolio effect* and by harbouring stress-tolerant sub-sets.

### 5.2 Implications for Non-Grassland Ecosystems
• Forest trait diversity buffered 50 % of warming-induced productivity decline (Canada case).  
• Coral probiotic consortia reduced bleaching mortality under heat stress.  
• In floodplain lakes, connectivity modulated the impact of land-use stress on functional diversity.  
=> Across realms, **diversity appears most valuable where and when stress is greatest**.

## 6. Unifying Mechanistic Framework
| Mechanism | Evidence Outside Grasslands | Operative Scale | Key Modulators |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Niche complementarity (resource partitioning) | Eastern USA forests (richness → productivity), Canadian forests (traits) | Stand (0.01–1 ha) | Trait packing vs divergence, soil fertility |
| Selection / Mass Ratio | Boreal SOC study (dominance of conservative trait spectrum) | Landscape (1–10 km²) | Soil pH, parent material |
| Facilitation | Mycorrhiza–tree carbon loop; coral microbiome | Organism ↔ community | Symbiont diversity, host genotype |
| Eco-Evolutionary Feedback | Alewife–zooplankton | Decadal | Population genetic variance, harvest pressure |
| Landscape Connectivity | Welsh blueprint; Yangtze lakes | Catchment to basin | Barrier density, flood pulses |
| Response Diversity (stress buffering) | 46-experiment synthesis; Canadian forests | Inter-annual | Climate velocity, disturbance regime |

## 7. Research & Monitoring Recommendations
1. **Trait–Symbiont Factorials**  
   Manipulate tree species × mycorrhizal type × microbial inoculum under warming/drought mesocosms to partition variance among plant, fungus, and microbiome.

2. **Real-time Eco-Evolutionary Monitoring**  
   • Employ eDNA + nanopore sequencing in headwater systems to detect allele-frequency shifts that precede functional flips (e.g., trophic cascade onset).  
   • Link to ecohydrological models to forecast nutrient spirals.

3. **Multi-kingdom BEF Metrics**  
   • Develop *function-centric* alpha and beta diversity indices (e.g., ‘thermal-tolerance‐weighted ASV richness’) for coral reef management MPAs.  

4. **Connectivity-Function Thresholds**  
   • Use graph theory + empirical nutrient‐retention data to derive barrier‐removal priorities that maximise functional gains per dollar.

5. **Policy Innovation**  
   • **Microbiome Restoration Permitting** analogous to wetland mitigation banking.  
   • Include **symbiont diversity credits** in REDD+ and forest carbon schemes.

## 8. Conclusions
Beyond grasslands, BEF mechanisms are **multidimensional**: classical complementarity and selection still operate, but **microbial facilitation, symbiont identity, eco-evolutionary feedbacks and landscape connectivity** frequently dominate ecosystem-scale outcomes.  Stress gradients—climate warming, pollution, fragmentation—**amplify** the positive contributions of biodiversity, making conservation of *functional and symbiotic diversity* a frontline climate-adaptation strategy.

Implementing trait–symbiont aware management, restoring hydrological connectivity, and adopting microbiome stewardship can unlock substantial carbon, nutrient and resilience dividends across forests, freshwaters and reefs.  Failure to incorporate these emerging mechanisms risks **underestimating** both the value of biodiversity and the cost of its loss.
