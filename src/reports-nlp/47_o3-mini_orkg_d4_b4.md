# Final Report: Verifying and Improving Factuality in Language Models via Grounded Court Debate

_Date: September 5, 2025_

This report provides an extensive examination of the ongoing research efforts and methodological innovations in verifying and improving factuality in language models (LMs) when deployed in contexts of grounded court debates. By synthesizing multifaceted insights from legal argumentation frameworks, model synchronization techniques, and evaluation methodologies, we aim to chart a roadmap for hybrid approaches that integrate both symbolic legal reasoning and quantitative predictive measures. The report is organized into several sections: an introduction to the conceptual framework, detailed analyses of formal argumentation methods, technical integration with legislative and dynamic dialogue systems, evaluation metrics, challenges related to fairness and multilinguality, and future research directions.

## 1. Introduction

The necessity to enhance the factuality of legal language model outputs has become increasingly pressing as LMs become tools in simulating courtroom debates and interpreting complex legal texts. The primary query investigated in our research—using “Grounded Court Debate” as a milieu to verify and improve the factuality of legal arguments—bridges traditional legal analysis with state-of-the-art machine learning. This approach is not merely a simulated legal exercise, but an integrated framework that emphasizes both the **veracity of legal arguments** and the **alignment of model outputs with historical case law and legislative constructs**. 

Key questions addressed include:

- How to formalize and evaluate the veracity of legal arguments in simulated courtroom debates?
- How to extend and calibrate existing evaluation metrics (e.g., AUC, perplexity, average surprisal) for the legal domain?
- In what ways can novel benchmarking techniques be developed that incorporate legal procedure nuances, multilingual biases, and the dynamic nature of legislative changes?

The following sections detail our findings and learning from previous research and evaluate multiple frameworks that range from ASPIC+ to UML-based legislative structuring.

## 2. Formalizing Legal Argumentation: Frameworks and Systems

### 2.1 ASPIC+ and Defeasible Reasoning

The ASPIC+ framework has emerged as a foundational tool for formalizing defeasible inference in legal argumentation. Its application in projects such as CATO (Aleven and Ashley) and HYPO (Rissland and Ashley) has provided significant insights into modelling logical, case-based reasoning that mirrors real-world judicial processes. ASPIC+ distinguishes between strict (deductive) and defeasible (non-deductive) rules, making it ideal for representing complex argument schemes and undercutting attacks in legal debates.

**Key Learnings:**

- Multiple research efforts have adapted ASPIC+ to encode argument schemes and defeasible rules. This is particularly useful in differentiating between rules that are inherently binding (strict) and those that require further justification (defeasible).
- Recent adaptations include models that incorporate deductive, defeasible, and probabilistic reasoning, enhancing the ability of LMs to dynamically adjust to varying burdens of proof encountered in legal disputes.

### 2.2 The Value Judgment and Weight Learning Paradigm (VJAP System)

The VJAP system represents a hybrid approach that merges symbolic legal reasoning with quantitative confidence measures via the Value Judgment Formalism. By integrating iterative optimization techniques into argument graphs, VJAP can compute and propagate confidence weights that are learned from historical case outcomes, particularly in trade secret misappropriation and related legal challenges.

**Key Learnings:**

- VJAP effectively demonstrates how quantitative confidence propagation can be layered over traditional argumentation, thus generating explicit legal arguments alongside outcome predictions.
- Its quantitative performance is currently limited by small case datasets, yet the methodology itself is promising, especially when integrated with larger, domain-specific legal corpora.

### 2.3 Carneades, ABA+, and Related Formalisms

Other frameworks, such as the Carneades model and logical systems like ABA+ and DeLP, help in structuring the argumentation process by distinguishing between various burdens of proof and dynamic responsibility shifts during legal proceedings. These systems allow for a nuanced interpretation of evidentiary standards, reflecting rigorous formal legal proofs.

**Key Learnings:**

- Carneades and its peers stress the importance of dynamic burdens of proof which evolve during litigation, a notion that is paralleled in dialogue models like DiaLaw.
- This line of research underscores the necessity for evaluation metrics that capture not just the logical structure but also the procedural nuances of legal deliberation.

## 3. Integrating Legislative Structures and Dynamic Synchronization

### 3.1 UML-Based Legislative Modelling and Dynamic Updates

Recent research on UML model synchronization—utilizing frameworks like Harmony and rewriting logic via Maude—provides methodologies that ensure consistency in highly dynamic and heterogeneous legislative specifications. Such techniques are critical when integrating legislation that varies across jurisdictions and is subject to real-time updates.

**Key Learnings:**

- UML-based approaches facilitate real-time legislative structuring, enabling LMs to align legal texts with current statutes and cross-jurisdictional requirements. 
- These techniques can be extended to enable dynamic updates during simulated debates, ensuring that discussions remain reflective of current legal frameworks.

### 3.2 Multimodal and Synchronization Techniques for Legal Dialogue

Systems like CLAVIUS have proven the potential of multimodal frameworks by integrating co-occurring cues such as speech and hand gestures. Such approaches can enhance the authenticity and accuracy of legal argumentation models, especially when combined with rigorous synchronization methods inspired by incremental frameworks found in interactive music systems and even firefly-inspired algorithms.

**Key Learnings:**

- Multimodal integration boosts semantic interpretation accuracy, offering a more holistic view of courtroom or debate settings where visual and auditory cues impact the perceived veracity of arguments.
- These methods also pave the way for future research in synchronizing multi-agent dialogues across different linguistic and cultural contexts.

## 4. Evaluative Metrics and Methodological Considerations

### 4.1 Calibration of Conventional and Novel Metrics

The evaluation of legal language model outputs in debate contexts requires metrics that balance quantitative rigour with qualitative fidelity. Traditional measures such as AUC, perplexity, and average surprisal have been recalibrated for legal applications by aligning them with unsupervised similarity-aligned ensemble metrics. Notably, approaches like AlignLLM have demonstrated that reconstructing problem-space and solution-space alignments can correlate significantly with ground-truth assessments.

**Key Learnings:**

- Unsupervised ensemble methods mitigate single-model bias and offer robust evaluations by aggregating multiple perspectives from general-purpose LLMs.
- Both narrative-based (qualitative) and statistical (quantitative) frameworks must be integrated to capture the full spectrum of legal argument quality. This is especially critical in measuring factuality in adversarial legal debates where the structure of legal reasoning evolves continuously.

### 4.2 Domain-Specific Fairness and Bias Mitigation

Fairness evaluation has become a focal point, with benchmarks like Fairlex providing multilingual and intersectional analysis across jurisdictions (e.g., European Council, USA, Swiss, Chinese). These benchmarks assess five fairness attributes (gender, age, nationality/region, language, legal area), highlighting persistent disparities even after applying group-robust fine-tuning techniques.

**Key Learnings:**

- Persistent fairness disparities emphasize the need for targeted, domain-specific fine-tuning, potentially using parameter-efficient approaches that tune around 0.1% of model parameters.
- Multilingual bias, particularly in simulated courtroom settings, underscores the urgency to incorporate expert testimony systems and culturally informed mechanisms to mitigate interpreter variability and linguistic biases.

### 4.3 Simulated Legal Dialogue and Procedural Dynamics

Models such as DiaLaw and HELICII have advanced the simulation of legal dialogues by encoding the nuances of burden of proof shifts and evidentiary reasoning. These simulated debates, which compare with in-court procedures like the Dutch civil summons system, provide quantifiable insights into how LMs might better mirror the procedural and rhetorical intricacies of real-world legal forums.

**Key Learnings:**

- Differentiation between production and tactical burdens in simulations must be reflected in evaluation metrics, ensuring that changes in argument strategy are captured accurately.
- Such models demonstrate the utility of formal dialogue games, which offer a controlled environment to test the factuality and overall coherence of legal arguments generated by LMs.

## 5. Challenges and Future Directions

### 5.1 Balancing Interpretability and Predictive Accuracy

One of the most pressing challenges is balancing the interpretability of legal arguments generated by hybrid systems with the predictive performance of statistical models. While domain-specific, fine-tuned models (like JuriBERT or ITALIAN-LEGAL-BERT) have made substantial inroads, they face trade-offs between scalability, resource efficiency, and the preservation of explicit legal reasoning.

**Potential Solutions:**

- Develop ensemble methodologies that combine the strengths of both symbolic frameworks (e.g., ASPIC+, VJAP) and statistical predictors. The AlignLLM approach, for example, may be extended to create dual evaluation spaces that are robust to domain adaptations.
- Investigate parameter-efficient adaptation techniques that maximize performance while minimizing the computational overhead and reducing the dependence on large annotated datasets.

### 5.2 Mitigating Intersectional Bias and Multilingual Challenges

Despite significant progress via benchmarks such as Fairlex and LexGLUE, mitigating bias across linguistic and cultural dimensions remains imperative. Persistent group disparities call for innovative strategies that integrate expert feedback with quantitative bias detection tools.

**Potential Solutions:**

- Incorporate advanced ensemble alignment techniques that ensure a better representation of marginalized groups through simulated legal dialogues, thus enhancing the fairness of fact-checking protocols in legal debates.
- Leverage continuous calibration scales and real-time feedback mechanisms in multilingual legal simulations to dynamically adjust for observed biases, ensuring a more equitable representation across genders, ages, and cultural backgrounds.

### 5.3 Enhancing Scalability and Real-time Integration

The dynamic nature of legislation and judicial proceedings necessitates real-time synchronization of legal reasoning. Techniques adapted from UML-based legislative modelling and synchronization strategies (akin to those used in interactive music systems) hold promise in aligning asynchronous inputs across jurisdictions.

**Potential Solutions:**

- Develop hybrid architectures that combine modular legal argumentation systems with real-time UML-based updates, ensuring that LMs reliably reflect the current state of legal regimes.
- Explore temporal synchronization and decentralized adaptation models that can reconcile dynamic legal inputs, further enhancing the robustness of fact-checking within simulated courtroom debates.

## 6. Conclusion

This report has detailed the current landscape and emerging methodologies for verifying and improving the factuality of legal language models through grounded court debates. By integrating formal argumentation frameworks like ASPIC+ and VJAP with dynamic synchronization techniques and robust fairness evaluations, researchers are paving the way for more transparent, equitable, and accurate legal AI systems.

Key research avenues include:

- The synthesis of symbolic legal reasoning with quantitative confidence measures, thereby achieving a balance between interpretability and predictive accuracy.
- The adoption of ensemble evaluation techniques that can robustly assess factuality in adversarial legal debates.
- Novel synchronization frameworks for real-time legislative integration to support multi-jurisdictional legal simulations.

Continuing investigations into these hybrid methodologies, along with parameter-efficient domain adaptations and sophisticated bias mitigation strategies, will be critical in advancing the fidelity and reliability of legal NLP systems. Future work should emphasize cross-disciplinary collaborations that bridge AI, legal scholarship, and cognitive linguistics to handle the complex interplay between legal argument quality and factual veracity.
