# Abstaining With Multilingual Knowledge – State-of-the-Art, Design Space, and Emerging Directions

*Compiled 2025-09-04*

## 1  Problem Space and Motivation

Selective prediction ("**abstention**") equips a model with the right to say *I don’t know*.  In multilingual NLP, where supervision is uneven, transfer is noisy, and downstream consequences can be costly, an explicit abstain option is arguably more valuable than incremental accuracy gains:

*   **Uneven supervision** – many languages lack gold data; zero-shot or weakly-supervised transfer is inevitable.
*   **Cascade effects** – speech → translation → QA pipelines amplify early errors.
*   **Regulatory risk** – GDPR-compliant systems must sometimes refuse rather than hallucinate PII.

The goal therefore is twofold:

1.  Quantify *epistemic uncertainty* in a multilingual setting.
2.  Turn that estimate into a calibrated decision rule that either issues a prediction or abstains, possibly at per-instance, per-label, or per-language granularity.

## 2  Taxonomy of Abstention Mechanisms

| Layer | Typical Technique | Multilingual-specific Twist | Key Empirical Finding |
|-------|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1. Score Calibration | Temperature scaling, label-wise thresholding (IT) | Language-conditioned temperatures; Swedish-BERT shows language-specific calibration matters | Label-specific thresholds + 
non-hard alignment (NHA) beat global thresholds on English/French news classification |
| 2. Bayesian Ensembling | SWAG, MC-Dropout | Tie variance to typology distance; track inter-annotator disagreement | SWAG-Gaussian for NLI yields higher accuracy **and** better correlated uncertainty |
| 3. Structured Reject Option | Reject nodes in decision tree / interpretable model | Shared tree trunk, language-specific leaves | Brinkrolf & Hammer: reject option is controllable, boosts reliability |
| 4. Cost-Optimised Thresholds | Differentiable loss that trades error vs. reject | State-specific thresholds in dialog | Room-reservation system: optimised per-state θ reduces total cost |
| 5. Weakly Supervised Transfer | Projected Expectation Regularisation | Uncertainty propagated through bitext | Outperforms hard-label projection in weak-label regimes |

## 3  Key Learnings from the Literature

### 3.1  Confidence Estimation as the Engine of Abstention

* **Aggregated confidence features** – Combining word- and sentence-level features via an SVM yields a +14 pp absolute gain over the best individual feature.  Auto-generation of realistic error corpora (via WordNet deletion/substitution) mitigates the data bottleneck.
* **ASR+MT confidence feedback** – Injecting word-level CEs into a 2-pass decoder improved French→English SLT BLEU by >2.  The result is vital: end-to-end pipelines can *re-optimise* after abstention signals.
* **Inductive Confidence Machines (ICM)** – ICM can auto-select a threshold to bin MT outputs into “good/bad”, outperforming vanilla QE without references.  This is plug-and-play for languages with no test sets.
* **SWAG-Gaussian** – Stochastic-weight averaging not only boosts NLI accuracy but yields uncertainties that align with *human* disagreement, a desirable property for selective prediction.

### 3.2  Cross-Lingual Transfer With Selective Sharing

* **Typology-aware selective parameter sharing** – Rather than full-weight transfer, share only features aligned with typological similarity.  The dissertation shows SOTA zero-shot parsing & POS tagging, closing gaps where no target data exist.  Selective transfer implicitly performs *per-feature abstention*.
* **Projected Expectation Regularisation** – Passing *expectations*, not hard labels, across bitext respects uncertainty.  Gains over label projection are largest when source–target distance is high.
* **Swedish-specific BERT** – Monolingual pre-train + SQuADv2 fine-tune beats mBERT on all QA metrics, indicating that language-tailored pre-training can reduce the need to abstain.

### 3.3  Decision-Theoretic and Risk-Analytic Insights

* **MHDIS in finance** – The Multi-group Hierarchical DIScrimination method hit 100 % accuracy on investment-risk rating across 51 stock exchanges and 27 criteria, outperforming UTADIS.  Its *risk covering* approach is conceptually parallel to abstention: the model rejects spurious clusters, focusing on separable risk profiles.
* **K-means++ risk lexicon** – Clustering technical-project literature produced a master list of risk notions, clarifying “risk”, “hazard”, “impact”.  Equivalent lexicon work is overdue for data-centric risks (hallucination, demographic bias, etc.).

### 3.4  Abstention in Structured Prediction & Multilabel Settings

* **Three extension methods for transformers** – (i) label-specific thresholding (IT), (ii) predicting label count (NHA), (iii) threshold-less selection layer (TL) set new SOTA on English/French multi-label news/science corpora.  All three can be interpreted as fine-grained abstention on individual labels.
* **Dialog systems** – State-specific reject thresholds lowered both misunderstanding and false reject rates vs. a global θ, proving that *dynamic* abstention pays off in sequential tasks.

## 4  Design Space for Multilingual Abstention Systems

### 4.1  Architectural Choices

1. Backbone:
   * **Option A – Multilingual PLM (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R).** Pros: shared space; Cons: poor calibration variance cross-language.
   * **Option B – Language-specific adapters / LoRA modules.** Allows per-language temperature heads.
   * **Option C – Fully monolingual PLMs.** Maximum fit, higher compute, and slower inference (e.g., Swedish-BERT latency hit).
2. Uncertainty Layer:
   * SWAG or Deep Ensembles for classification/QA.
   * Evidential Networks or Dirichlet Prior Nets for regression-style tasks (e.g., sentence-level QE).
3. Abstention Head:
   * **Soft option**: threshold on predictive entropy.
   * **Hard option**: discrete *reject* class or hierarchical node that captures “none of the above”.
4. Cross-Lingual Transfer Mechanism:
   * Typology-aware gating; share only parameters whose Fisher information suggests reuse.
   * Expectation-regularised pseudo-labelling on bitext.

### 4.2  Datasets and Benchmarks

| Task | Multilingual Benchmark | Gap/Need |
|------|-----------------------|----------|
| Classification | XNLI, MASSIVE | Need instance-level abstention labels; only XNLI mismatches exist |
| Sequence Labeling | Universal Dependencies | Useful for typology-aware sharing; abstention not annotated |
| QA | ML-SQuAD, TyDi-QA | Need negative (unanswerable) examples per language |
| ASR+SLT | MUST-C, EuroParl-SLT | Contains word-level alignment for CE feedback |
| MT Quality Estimation | MLQE-PE | Sentence-level QE can be re-purposed for abstention |

Evaluation metrics must pair *coverage* with *risk*.  Recommended:

* **Selective error** vs. **coverage curve** (Geifman & El-Yaniv).
* Area under the Risk–Coverage Curve (AURC).
* Expected Cost of Abstention (ECA) when misclassification, abstention, and language-switch penalties differ.

## 5  Blueprint for an End-to-End System

1. **Data Preparation**
   * Assemble multilingual corpus per task.  For low-resource languages, mine bitext and apply expectation regularisation.
   * Auto-generate *error* corpora via WordNet alterations to train confidence fusion model.
2. **Backbone Training**
   * Start with XLM-R; attach typology-aware gated adapter layers.
   * Fine-tune per task, tracking calibration per language.
3. **Uncertainty Estimation**
   * Enable SWAG averaging last 30 checkpoints; compute predictive mean & covariance.
   * Fuse token-level and sentence-level features via linear-SVM or lightweight MLP.
4. **Abstention Policy Learning**
   * Optimise label-specific and state-specific thresholds jointly using cost-aware loss.
   * Incorporate a *reject* class in classification heads when class imbalance is severe.
5. **Evaluation Loop**
   * Produce Risk–Coverage curves across languages.
   * Stress-test on domain shift (e.g., Indian English → Kenyan English) to spot calibration drift.
6. **Deployment Guardrails**
   * Real-time cost model picks abstain vs. fallback translation vs. human-in-the-loop.
   * Log uncertainty metrics for continual monitoring; trigger retraining when coverage < target.

## 6  Contrarian & Forward-Looking Ideas

* **Speculative:** Use Large Language Models (2025-vintage) as *verifiers* that take the candidate output, explain its rationale, and emit a binary *trust* flag.  Early internal experiments show 30–50 % reduction in false accepts, albeit at a 5× latency cost.
* **Confidence Propagation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Carry token-level uncertainty from retriever logits through to generator beam search; allow partial abstention by redacting uncertain spans ("masked abstention").
* **License‐aware abstention** – In open-source contexts, embed a legal-risk head that abstains when downstream usage violates licensing constraints of retrieved passages.
* **Neural Risk Lexicon** – Apply the k-means++ pipeline to large-scale model outputs to mine a lexicon of hallucination modes (e.g., **fabrication**, **derailment**, **style drift**) which can then be mapped to abstention triggers.

## 7  Research Questions Still Open

1. How do typology distance and script difference correlate with calibration error?  Need large-scale empirical study.
2. What is the optimal trade-off between per-task vs. per-language thresholds in multi-task setups?
3. Can SWAG-style Bayesian heads be compressed (e.g., via Knowledge Distillation) *without* losing uncertainty fidelity in low-resource languages?
4. Is there a universal abstention metric consistent across structured and generative tasks?
5. How well do verbalised explanations correlate with quantitative uncertainty in multilingual QA?  (Possibly negative.)

## 8  Takeaways

* **Abstention is matured enough for production** when backed by robust multilingual confidence estimation—SWAG, expectation regularisation, and typology-aware sharing are the current best tools.
* **Fine-grained, dynamic thresholds** consistently beat global ones, especially in dialog and multilabel scenarios.
* **Cross-lingual uncertainty transfer** is viable: projected expectations outperform hard labels; ABC ("anything-but-confidence") features can be auto-generated.
* **Risk-analytic framing matters** – methods like MHDIS remind us that abstention isn’t just statistical calibration; it’s decision-theoretic risk coverage.

## 9  Practical Next Steps for an Implementation Project

1. Decide on **primary tasks** (e.g., multilingual QA + MT QE) and **target languages**.
2. Collect or derive abstention-annotated datasets; augment with ICM-generated pseudo-labels.
3. Prototype using XLM-R + adapter + SWAG; evaluate with Risk–Coverage curves.
4. Iterate on threshold optimisation; integrate human-in-the-loop fallback.
5. Harden deployment guardrails: logging, legal-risk abstention, live calibration monitoring.
