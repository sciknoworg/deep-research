# Final Report: Mitigating First Name Biases in LLMs by Few-Shot Prompting

## 1. Introduction

The prevalence of biases in language models, particularly those related to first names, presents an imperative challenge at the intersection of machine learning fairness and natural language processing. First name biases can manifest across several dimensions, including gender bias, ethnic bias, and socio-demographic perceptions. This report provides an in-depth exploration of mitigating such biases through few-shot prompting, synthesizing findings from recent research. We detail strategies, challenges, evaluation metrics, and complementary methods that can be employed to counteract undesirable stereotyping, especially in contexts where intersectional identities are at risk.

## 2. Background and Context

### 2.1 Dimensions of First Name Bias

Bias associated with first names is multifaceted:

- **Gender Bias:** Models tend to associate certain names with specific gender roles, often reinforcing stereotypical gender behaviors.
- **Ethnic Bias:** Names that are uncommon or ethnic in nature can trigger misrepresentations in sentiment, perceived competence, or reliability. Empirical studies, conducted across regions like the US, UK, and Singapore, note that Western or common names often receive preferential treatment relative to ethnic or non-Western names.
- **Intersectional Bias:** When gender and ethnicity intersect (for example, non-Western female names), biases become more pronounced. Intersectional identities pose a unique challenge as they require simultaneous consideration of multiple social dimension signals in the model’s inference process.

### 2.2 The Role of Few-Shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting allows practitioners to guide LLM behavior by providing a limited number of examples that illustrate correct or fair responses. This strategy serves two key purposes:

- **Direct Intervention in Output Generation:** By illustrating fair treatment and correct contextual interpretations, few-shot examples can directly mitigate the influence of stereotypical associations learned during large-scale pretraining.
- **Adaptability:** Few-shot prompting permits rapid adaptation across various contexts (e.g., sentiment analysis, recommendation systems) without extensive model retraining, thereby serving as a flexible tool in addressing emerging bias issues.

## 3. Methodological Approaches

### 3.1 Advanced Prompt Engineering & Safety Prompts

Recent studies highlight that controlled prompt engineering—using safety prompts that monitor refusal rates, toxicity, and token-level regard—successfully diminishes stereotypical outputs. Nonetheless, challenges remain when prompts involve complex intersectional identities. For instance, while LLM safety systems (post-ChatGPT era) provide substantial improvement in mitigating bias, ethnic and sexual orientation prompts still trigger disproportionate bias responses.

### 3.2 Integrating Enriched Identity Signals

Building on approaches such as the Bayesian Improved First Name Surname Geocoding (BIFSG) technique, researchers have shown that augmenting first name data with additional identity signals helps reduce classification errors. In the scope of few-shot prompting, this means integrating enriched demonstrations that include supplementary identity information can guide the model to interpret names in a more contextually accurate manner.

### 3.3 Label-Guided Data Augmentation and Cartography-Based Demonstration Selection

Techniques like PromptDA provide label-guided data augmentation that address issues of label bias and data scarcity. When combined with feature normalization and cartography-based demonstration selection methods, these techniques enhance few-shot learning robustness. The process involves:

- **Data Augmentation:** Generating additional training examples that counteract prevailing stereotypes.
- **Demonstration Selection:** Using cartography-based methods to identify and select examples that are most representative of fair behavior.

Such integrative methods support the creation of few-shot prompts that are inherently resistant to bias by diversifying and balancing the demonstration set.

### 3.4 Regularization and Inference Heuristics

One critical challenge with few-shot prompt-based fine-tuning is the risk of inducing inference heuristics—where the model might mistake lexical similarity for semantic equivalence. Techniques such as the DifferentiAble pRompT (DART) approach and targeted regularization that preserve pretraining weights have been proposed. These methods constrain the model from overgeneralizing based on superficial cues, ensuring that bias mitigation does not come at the cost of performance.

### 3.5 Complementary Methods Beyond Few-Shot Prompting

Though few-shot prompting is promising, it is rarely the sole solution. Combining it with methods such as fine-tuning, adversarial de-biasing, and data augmentation forms a robust debiasing pipeline. For example, adversarial de-biasing—similar to iterative removal of gender signals in word embeddings—can be adapted for LLMs, isolating bias signals into designated sub-vectors and reducing their impact on final predictions.

## 4. Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks

Assessing the effectiveness of debiasing strategies requires robust, multi-dimensional metrics. Studies have employed a suite of criteria including:

- **Refusal Rates:** Frequency with which the model declines to generate potentially biased outputs
- **Toxicity Levels and Sentiment Scores:** Quantitative markers for negative or stereotyped content
- **Regard Measures:** How respondents perceive the fairness or respectfulness in responses
- **Directional Pairwise Class Confusion Bias:** A recently introduced metric that quantifies subtle preferential biases by examining class discrepancies in model outputs, particularly for intersectional identities.

In addition, benchmarking across different cultural and linguistic settings is crucial. Evaluations should consider settings such as multilingual tasks and region-specific demographics (e.g., scenarios in Singapore, the US, and the UK) to generalize the findings. The challenge remains that even comprehensive surveys may see a fairness-performance trade-off—with bias mitigation sometimes decreasing raw performance by 42–75% while only improving fairness by 29–59% in some cases.

## 5. Experimental Evidence from Recent Research

Empirical investigations support several key hypotheses:

1. **Enhanced Prompt Safety:** Safety prompts and autocompletion audits reduce overt stereotypes but are still limited in scenarios involving intersectional identities.

2. **Data Augmentation and Enriched Signals:** Augmenting first name inputs with auxiliary identity attributes improves classification accuracy of ethnic and gender biases, as demonstrated by the BIFSG-enhanced prompting techniques.

3. **Regularization in Few-Shot Settings:** Approaches such as DART and weight-preserving regularizations have shown that careful balancing during fine-tuning maintains generalization performance while mitigating bias.

4. **Interdisciplinary Approaches:** The integration of prompt engineering with adversarial de-biasing showcases promising results, suggesting that controlling latent gender or ethnicity signals traditionally entrenched in pretraining datasets is feasible when combined with targeted intervention methods.

## 6. Discussion and Future Directions

While few-shot prompting represents a powerful tool in the fight against first name biases in LLMs, the ongoing challenge remains the complex interplay of multiple bias dimensions. Future research directions should focus on:

- **Joint Debiasing Approaches:** Integrate few-shot prompting with complementary methods such as fine-tuning and adversarial interventions to reach a more optimal fairness-performance trade-off.
- **Dynamic Prompt Engineering:** Explore adaptive and context-sensitive prompting strategies that continuously adjust based on real-time model feedback (e.g., dynamic safety thresholds for various intersectional scenarios).
- **Cross-Cultural and Multilingual Benchmarks:** Develop datasets and benchmarks that capture subtle biases in diverse cultural contexts, ensuring that mitigating strategies generalize well beyond Western-centric perspectives.
- **Long-Term Model Auditing:** Implement continuous auditing systems that use autocompletion and iterative feedback loops to monitor and correct emerging bias patterns in deployed models.

## 7. Recommendations

Given the state-of-the-art methods detailed above, the following recommendations are proposed:

- **Multi-Modal Integration:** Consider integrating external sources of identity verification (e.g., combining first names with surname geocoding) to enrich prompt demonstrations.
- **Robust Evaluation Framework:** Employ a comprehensive suite of bias-related metrics—including directional pairwise class confusion bias—to fully capture the nuances of stereotyping in various contexts.
- **Iterative Feedback and Update Cycles:** Incorporate user feedback as part of the model refinement cycle to dynamically adjust few-shot demonstration sets, further enhancing fairness.
- **Contingency Strategies:** Develop fallback mechanisms within prompting that trigger safe completions in instances where the model’s output exhibits signs of bias, particularly for intersectional cases.
- **Scalable Solutions:** Focus on designing methodologies that are not only effective in controlled research environments but also scalable to industrial applications where real-time bias mitigation is critical.

## 8. Conclusion

Mitigating first name biases in LLMs via few-shot prompting presents opportunities to directly counteract entrenched stereotypes without the need for extensive retraining. However, careful integration of complementary methods—such as enriched identity signals, regularization practices, and adversarial de-biasing—is necessary to address the breadth of bias dimensions, particularly in complex intersectional scenarios. While promising, these methods must contend with performance trade-offs and cultural nuances that require continual evaluation and refinement. This report underscores the importance of a multi-pronged approach and provides a framework for future work in achieving balanced fairness and model performance in next-generation language systems.
