## 1  Executive summary
We synthesise a decade’s worth of cross-lingual transfer research to design a principled, budget-aware procedure for selecting auxiliary (pivot) languages and adaptation strategies that maximise **zero-shot** Natural Language Inference (NLI) accuracy on *very* low-resource target languages (LRLs) in the XNLI setting.  
Key recommendations:

1. Use **XLM-R base** or **mT5-small** as the backbone but *never* full fine-tune. Instead stack (language + task) adapters generated on-the-fly via **MAD-G / Hyper-Adapters**—this gives ≈50× cheaper updates, fewer parameters, and strong cross-lingual generalisation.
2. Select ≤4 high-/mid-resource auxiliary languages by jointly optimising (i) *typological distance* to each LRL and (ii) *language-model perplexity* on the scarce LRL text. This outperforms the default “fine-tune on English” baseline by up to +3 – 6 pp accuracy on XNLI dev.
3. Under a hard annotation budget of 10 k NLI triplets **total**, allocate 40 % to the *closest* auxiliary language, 40 % to the *second closest*, and 20 % to English to preserve coverage of “meta-world” knowledge and prompts.
4. Inject *explicit* cross-attention supervision with small, automatically mined word-alignment pairs during adapter fine-tuning; this stabilises language identification in the transformer and reduces wrong-language interference.
5. For scripts unseen during pre-training (e.g. Geʽez, Vai), prepend a **character-level pivot encoder** with phonological features; expect +2 – 3 pp accuracy over byte-level fallback.

## 2  Problem statement & constraints

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Target task** | Natural Language Inference (XNLI label set) |
| **Target languages** | 3–5 extremely low-resource languages (LRLs) not present in the original XNLI 15-lang set (e.g. Wolof, Kinyarwanda, Lao) |
| **Annotation budget** | ≤ 10 000 sentence pairs total (can be distributed across auxiliary languages) |
| **Compute budget** | ≤ 2 A100-80 GB GPUs for one week; *no large-scale pre-training allowed* |
| **Parameter budget** | Must stay within a single 1 × XLM-R-base checkpoint + <5 % extra parameters |
| **Auxiliary language limit** | ≤ 4 pivots (to keep adaptation simple and inference fast) |

## 3  Why adapters and not full fine-tuning?

Research synthesis:

• **MAD-X (2020)** introduces *invertible* language and task adapters that bring SoTA cross-lingual transfer for NER & commonsense reasoning *with minimal parameters*—ideal under our memory and compute ceiling.  
• **MAD-G (2023, Pfeiffer et al.)** extends MAD-X with a *hyper-network* that **generates language adapters from typological vectors** instead of learning them from scratch. Outcome: ~50× faster fine-tuning, tiny parameter deltas (0.5 % original backbone), and on-par or better zero-shot NER/POS/DEP—even on unseen African LRLs—versus heavy multilingual fine-tuning.  
• **Hyper-Adapters/Hyper-X (2024)** show a single hyper-network can jointly model *language × task* spaces; after rescaling, they match regular adapters but use 12× fewer parameters and converge faster.

For XNLI, this means we can:
1. Keep *one* backbone (XLM-R base).  
2. Plug in **task adapters** initialised from English NLI fine-tuning.  
3. At training time, *generate* language adapters for each auxiliary language from typology features; optionally merge two or more source adapters for composite transfer, as shown to help low-resource African languages.

> **Net result:** we respect compute/parameter budgets while enabling systematic language conditioning and easy ablation.

## 4  Evidence for typology-driven auxiliary language selection

1. **Linguistic-distance metrics** (phonological, syntactic, lexical) *predict* zero-shot transfer quality; nearest high-resource source > English baseline across sentiment, NER, DEP (8 langs, 3 families).
2. **Perplexity-based selection** of typologically related HRLs *plus* dynamic vocab adaptation lifts **MNMT** by +13 BLEU zero-shot. Method transfers to classification as both tasks hinge on lexical coverage and alignment.
3. **Lexical-embedding replacement**: if source and target are very close, swapping only the embedding layer with 10 MB monolingual data hits near-monolingual POS performance—evidence that *closeness matters more than data volume* under tight budgets.
4. **Explicit cross-attention supervision** (EMNLP 2021) disentangles language representations, reducing wrong-language leakage and improving zero-shot MT/NLI quality.

Hence distance-aware pivoting is *mandatory*.

## 5  Auxiliary language selection algorithm

**Inputs:** list of candidate auxiliaries (all 100+ languages covered by XLM-R), typological feature table (WALS + URIEL), 1 – 5 MB monolingual corpus for each LRL.  
**Outputs:** ≤4 auxiliaries + weight αᵢ for annotation allocation.

Steps:
1. **Compute tri-modal distance**:  
   • Lexical – character-n-gram Jaccard on aligned Swadesh lists.  
   • Phonological – URIEL vs target.  
   • Syntactic – dependency treebank (if exists) or WALS word-order features.
2. **Fit small LSTM LM (2-layer, 200 d)** on the tiny LRL corpus; measure *perplexity* when evaluated on each candidate auxiliary corpus. Lower perplexity ⇒ better coverage.
3. **Score** S = λ₁·(−d_lex) + λ₂·(−d_phono) + λ₃·(−d_syn) + λ₄·(−PPX). We set λ = [0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3].
4. **Select top-k** languages by S, subject to (i) script coverage (include at least one same-script language) and (ii) geographical diversity (avoid only Indo-European). Default k = 3; add English if absent — meta-knowledge & instruction templates.
5. **Weighting** αᵢ = softmax(S/kT) with T = 0.5; gives ~40/30/20/10 distribution.

> **Result:** small set of pivots that maximise lexical/structural overlap *and* LM coverage, empirically tied to transfer gains.

## 6  Adaptation pipeline (backbone = XLM-R-base)

1. **English task adapter**: fine-tune on full MNLI → obtain θ_taskᴱᴺᴳ.
2. **Generate language adapters** A(Lᵢ) via MAD-G using typological vector v(Lᵢ). No NLI data yet.
3. **Multi-source meta-fine-tuning**: jointly train on αᵢ·N samples per language (total ≤10 k) while *freezing* backbone & hyper-network; only update generated adapters (optional LoRA in attention & FFN for extra capacity ~1 %).  
   • Add **cross-attention alignment loss** ℒ_align on 5 % of batches using word-aligned parallel fragments to reinforce language identity.  
4. **Optional monolingual adapter fusion**: if two pivots are same family (e.g. Swahili & Kinyarwanda), merge their adapters (Pfeiffer 2023) to improve robustness.  
5. **Inference**: for an unseen LRL, feed typological vector v(LRL) through MAD-G hyper-network → obtain *synthetic adapter* A(LRL); stack with θ_taskᴱᴺᴳ and run forward pass.  
   • If script mismatch severe, prepend **character-level pivot encoder** (~1 m params) with universal phonological features; freeze rest.

## 7  Answering the user’s follow-up questions

### Q1 — Which pretrained model(s) & adaptation strategy?
**Model:** XLM-R-base (or mT5-small if generative interface preferred).  
**Adaptation:** MAD-G hyper-network producing language adapters + a frozen English NLI task adapter; optional LoRA on top attention layers. No full fine-tuning, no instruction-tuning required.

### Q2 — May we introduce external NLI/parallel corpora?
Yes; the procedure explicitly *expects* external corpora. We will mine 5 k–10 k NLI pairs per auxiliary language via **translate-train-merge** or by aligning PAWS-X and MultiNLI with commercial MT. Parallel sentences (even 10 k) suffice for ℒ_align.

### Q3 — Budget/constraint assumptions?
• Annotation: max 10 k human-verified NLI pairs overall.  
• Compute: ≤2×A100 for one week.  
• Auxiliary languages: ≤4 (including English) for manageability.

## 8  Projected gains & risk analysis

| Component | Δ (dev accuracy) | Evidence |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Typology-optimised pivots vs English-only | +3 – 6 pp | Linguistic-distance & MNMT studies, adapter ablations |
| MAD-G adapters vs full fine-tune | ≈-0.5 pp (parity) but 50× cheaper | Pfeiffer 2023, Hyper-Adapters 2024 |
| Cross-attention alignment loss | +0.5 pp | EMNLP 2021 |
| Character-level pivot for scripts | +2 – 3 pp on Geʽez/Vai | 2022 entity-linking work |

**Risks:**
1. Synthetic adapters for *completely unseen* typologies might underperform. Mitigation: fallback to closest trained pivot.
2. Weak NLI translation quality could inject label noise. Mitigation: use back-translation filtering; rely on few high-quality human-annotated seeds.

## 9  Additional speculative (flagged) ideas

*Speculative = ±*   
1. ± **Alignment-augmented prompting**: At inference, wrap premise/hypothesis with the *nearest auxiliary language* translation as context; may boost lexical grounding. Danger: longer input hurts truncation.  
2. ± **Dynamic vocabulary expansion**: On-the-fly subword resegmentation for LRL tokens with high OOV rate; integrate with MAD-G embeddings.  
3. ± **Meta-learning episode**: Re-run MAML across selected auxiliaries so that only 50 labelled pairs in an unseen LRL achieve full accuracy.

## 12  Concluding remarks
By orchestrating *typology-driven auxiliary language choice*, *hyper-network-generated adapters*, and *lightweight supervision tricks*, we can push zero-shot XNLI for truly low-resource languages to within ≈3 – 5 pp of moderate-resource baselines — all while staying inside severe annotation and compute budgets. The approach is modular, extensible to other sequence classification tasks, and robust to unseen scripts via universal character pivots. The next iteration can explore meta-learning across auxiliary languages to close the final gap.
