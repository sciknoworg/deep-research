## 1 Motivation and Problem Statement
Bias in large language models (LLMs) is **culturally contingent**: what counts as a stereotype, pejorative, or harmful association varies sharply across linguistic communities. Most debiasing pipelines, however, operate monolingually, often in English. We seek a *self-debiasing* paradigm in which an LLM (or a coalition of its fine-tuned replicas) uses **cross-lingual interaction** to surface and mitigate culture-specific biases *without external human annotations at scale*.

Key questions to answer:
* Can cross-lingual perspectives act as an intrinsic “mirror”, enabling an LLM to diagnose its own blind spots?  
* Which algorithmic techniques—iterative self-distillation, multi-agent debate, RLHF, etc.—are most effective when the debating or student–teacher roles are distributed across languages?  
* How do we measure success when gold bias annotations are rare outside English?  

Our goal is to prototype, evaluate, and iterate on such a system, grounding every design choice in currently published empirical evidence and recognizing the sparse multilingual resources surfaced in recent work.

## 2 Landscape of Multilingual & Cultural Bias in LLMs

### 2.1 Empirical Gaps
1. **Benchmark paucity outside English.** The new *DisCo-derived gender-bias benchmark* for 11 Indian languages (ACL ’23) is a welcome addition, but coverage is still limited relative to the ∼7 000 living languages.  
2. **Granularity of measurement.** The *Directional Pairwise Class-Confusion (DPCC)* metric separates model-class vs. stereotype vs. domain bias, giving finer-grained audits across languages.  
3. **Task-transfer asymmetry.** AACL-IJCNLP ’22 shows that cross-lingual hate-speech detectors improve when the base is multi-task-tuned (sentiment, NER, syntax). These gains are largest for culturally distant pairs (e.g., Japanese→Swahili).  
4. **Instruction-tuning evidence.** *Social Contact Debiasing* (SCD) instruction-tunes LLaMA-2 family with 108 k “contact-hypothesis” prompts spanning 13 social axes, cutting measured bias by ≈ 40 % with just one epoch.

### 2.2 Missing Pieces
* Very few studies inspect **cross-lingual interaction as the debiasing mechanism itself**—most rely on additional annotated corpora or universal moral heuristics.
* Evaluation protocols seldom align metrics with *cultural acceptability judgments* made by local speakers rather than distant raters.

## 3 Design Space for Cross-Lingual *Self-Debiasing*
Below we map out the algorithmic levers, ordered from least to most intrusive wrt base weights.

| Lever | Description | Pros | Cons |
|-------|-------------|------|------|
| **Prompt-level debate** | Spawn two agents speaking different languages; each critiques the other’s answer for bias and supplies “counter-perspectives”. | Cheap, no weight update; immediate explainability. | No lasting debiasing; quality limited by prompting ingenuity. |
| **Iterative cross-lingual self-distillation (XL-SD)** | Generate bilingual (or N-lingual) question–answer–critique logs; fine-tune the base model on the *consensus* outputs masked for fairness signals. | Leaves a training trace, can converge quickly (< 3 epochs); piggybacks on SCD’s low compute recipe. | Needs high-quality critique prompts; risk of reinforcing shared blind spots. |
| **Multi-agent RLHF with cultural-diverse reward models** | Train reward models in each language; sample rollouts where agents must satisfy **all** cultural reward constraints. | Unified reward manifold; continuous improvement. | Large compute; reward hacking; requires multilingual preference data. |
| **Cross-lingual contrastive alignment (CCA)** | Embed same content in L1/L2; penalize latent dimension correlated with stereotypes using DPCC. | Abstracts away vocabulary, hits subtle biases. | Training signals noisy; danger of collapsing useful semantic info. |

## 4 Recommended Experimental Framework
Given resource constraints and the empirical wins of SCD and multi-task pre-training, we propose a **two-stage pipeline**:

### Stage A – Bias Surfacing via Prompt-Level Debate
1. **Language Pair Selection.** Use *typological & socio-cultural distance* matrix to pick four pairs:  
   • English–Arabic (high global relevance, script switch)  
   • Mandarin–Spanish (large LLM training corpora, distant families)  
   • Hindi–Tamil (shared geography, distinct families → leverages new Indian benchmark)  
   • Yoruba–French (post-colonial asymmetry, low-resource + high-resource).  
2. **Bias Probing Prompts.** Draw from:  
   • DisCo & SCD prompts (gender, religion, caste,…).  
   • Toxicity transfer tasks (English *RealToxicityPrompts* translated via human + LLM).  
3. **Critique Turn.** After each answer, a second agent in L2 flags potential bias and supplies a counter-narrative. Both outputs are then *back-translated* into English for logging via constrained decoding to reduce hallucination.

### Stage B – Iterative Cross-Lingual Self-Distillation (XL-SD)
4. **Consensus Filter.** Apply heuristics + DPCC to select answer variants with lower bias and comparable task utility.  
5. **Fine-Tuning.** Perform 1 epoch LoRA fine-tune on selected answers (≈ 120 k examples expected per iteration). Evidence from SCD suggests ~40 % bias reduction is plausible.  
6. **Freeze & Evaluate.** After each iteration, run full evaluation suite (§ 5). Stop once bias curve plateaus or utility degrades > 2 % on held-out.

Compute envelope: Single 40-B parameter model, mixed-precision; LoRA adapters → < 160 GPU-hours per iteration, feasible on a 8×A100 node.

## 5 Evaluation Suite & Metrics

### 5.1 Bias Detection
* **Directional Pairwise Class-Confusion (DPCC)** to isolate stereotype vs domain bias.  
* **Stereotype Content Tasks** extended into chosen languages; annotate via bilingual crowd workers on Surge/WeVerify.  
* **RealToxicityPrompts-X** (our extension) measuring toxicity transfer after translation.  
* **Cultural Appropriateness Rating**: 1–5 Likert by in-country raters; aggregated via MACE for reliability.

### 5.2 Utility & Regression Tests
* **Downstream task set**: MMLU-X subset, XNLI, TyDiQA.  
* **Fluency**: COMET-Kiwi machine translation quality when answers are round-tripped.  
* **Auxiliary fairness/robustness**: Gender pronoun coreference accuracy; code-mixing resilience.

Stop criteria:  
(1) ≥ 25 % average DPCC reduction across pairs **and**  
(2) ≤ 2 % macro-average drop on utility set.

## 6 Anticipated Challenges and Mitigation
1. **Translation artefacts.** Use pivoted evaluation: original-language raters wherever possible; back-translation only for logging.  
2. **Blind-spot concordance.** Two languages might *share* a stereotype (e.g., anti-Roma bias in many European tongues). Add a third “adversarial” language (e.g., Romani) in the debate loop to expose hidden consensus biases.  
3. **Reward model collapse.** During RLHF, normalize reward signals across languages via temperature scaling; maintain language-specific baselines.  
4. **Compute inequality for low-resource scripts.** Use tokenizer augmentation (UL2-SN ReSeg) and sub-vocab adaptation.  
5. **Ethical oversight.** Continuous red-teaming with cultural experts; adopt *structured content warnings* in logs.

## 8 Speculative Extensions (Foresight)
* **Multimodal Cross-Debiasing.** Incorporate culturally specific imagery—e.g., clothing, religious icons—paired with captions in L1/L2 to test vision–language stereotypes.  
* **Continual Learning via Streaming Cultural News.** Connect to the *Global Voices* RSS feed; weekly fine-tune adapters so the model adapts to evolving cultural norms.  
* **Privacy-Preserving Local Fine-Tuning.** Deploy federated LoRA, where local user groups fine-tune with culturally grounded data and only share adapter deltas.  
* **Dynamic Partner Selection.** Use a language-distance scoring network to pick the most informative “debate partner” on-the-fly, rather than fixed pairs.

## 9 Concluding Remarks
Our proposed pipeline leverages **cross-lingual interaction as both mirror and corrective** for cultural bias, grounded in three recent empirical findings: (i) fine-grained DPCC audits, (ii) low-compute but effective instruction-tuning (SCD), and (iii) gains from multilingual auxiliary task pre-training. By marrying *debate-style bias surfacing* with *iterative self-distillation*, we expect ≥ 30 % bias reduction while preserving task utility across four typologically diverse language pairs.

The project serves two purposes: practical mitigation for production-grade multilingual LLMs, and a general methodological template that other labs can replicate or extend (e.g., RLHF, multimodal). Importantly, all evaluation artifacts—prompts, translations, rater guidelines—will be released under CC-BY to catalyze broader community work on culturally situated AI fairness.

> "Bias is context + power; only by letting languages talk to each other can we triangulate the hidden power structures they each encode."
