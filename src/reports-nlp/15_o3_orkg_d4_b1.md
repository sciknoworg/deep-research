## Executive Summary
Culture‐sensitive phenomena (honorifics, idioms, socio-political context, dialects, speaker/listener relations, register, taboo avoidance, etc.) remain a major blind-spot for mainstream neural MT.  Recent empirical results—including PoliteParser’s +31–54 pp gains on English→Japanese honorific selection and context-aware NMT for Korean—demonstrate that explicitly modelling cultural variables can outperform purely data-driven systems.  This report synthesizes the latest research, proposes a multi-layered paradigm that can be grafted onto existing NMT or instantiated end-to-end, outlines training-data and evaluation strategies, and maps concrete integration paths (cloud, edge, and on-device).  

Key take-aways:  
* **Cultural dimensions to target first:** honorific & politeness systems, idiomatic phraseology, regional dialects, discourse-level deixis, and socio-politically loaded lexicon.  
* **Priority language pairs:** EN↔JA, EN↔KO, JA↔KO, EN↔AR (dialectal Arabic), ES↔QU (Spanish↔Quechua), and EN↔HI (honorifics + register); emphasis on pairs where cultural misrendering is high-impact and where partial resources already exist.  
* **Paradigm layers:** (1) Cultural Knowledge Graph, (2) Contextual Encoder with speaker/hearer features, (3) Plug-in policy modules (e.g., PoliteParser-type verb selectors), (4) Adaptive decoding with cultural-adequacy objectives, (5) Post-editing and evaluation workflows tuned with MEANT or similar semantics-aware metrics.

## 1. Problem Statement and Motivation
While BLEU/COMET scores have climbed, human users still flag culturally inappropriate output as a top quality-of-service failure mode.  Honorific errors alone invalidate otherwise fluent translations in Japanese contracts, Korean marketing copy, and Arabic diplomatic cables.  Idiom literalism generates ridicule on social media.  Dialect leveling erases identity.  

High-quality neural MT lacks an explicit representational layer for cultural variables; the data implicitly encodes them, but that signal is noisy, biased, and often overwritten by dominance of majority registers in crawled corpora.  Addressing this gap requires a paradigm that renders culture as a first-class feature—detectable, controllable, and measurable.

## 2. Cultural Phenomena and Language Pairs in Scope
### 2.1 Core Cultural Dimensions
1. **Honorific / Politeness Systems**  
   * Formal vs. plain verb morphology (JA, KO, HI).  
   * Second-person pronoun deferentials (DE “Sie” vs “du”).  
2. **Idiomatic / Figurative Expressions**  
   * Fixed multi-word units, proverbs, sports metaphors, memes.  
3. **Regional & Social Dialects**  
   * Maghrebi vs. Levantine Arabic; Kansai-ben vs. Standard Japanese; African-American Vernacular English.  
4. **Socio-politically loaded Lexicon**  
   * Gendered forms, colonial terminology, slurs.  
5. **Discourse-level Reference & Zero-Pronouns**  
   * Japanese zero subjects interact with honorific predicates and social rank.  
6. **Taboo & Euphemism Management**  
   * Indirectness in Malay or Japanese; rude directness in English.  

### 2.2 Priority Language Pairs and Rationale
| Pair | Cultural Challenges | Resource Landscape | Impact |
|------|--------------------|---------------------|--------|
| EN↔JA | Honorific verbs, zero pronouns, idioms | PoliteParser, JA honorific annotation schemes | Commercial & public users; high economic stakes |
| EN↔KO | Multiple speech levels, context-dependent verbs | Context-aware NMT w/ CAPE gains; need more corpora | K-content boom; global appeal |
| JA↔KO | Closest typologically; yet no honorific-labeled parallel corpus | Consider joint annotation effort | Regional integration, tourism |
| EN↔AR (MSA↔Dialect) | Dialect switching, politeness, gender | Sparse dialectal parallel; abundant monolingual | News, media, diplomacy |
| ES↔QU | Honorific suffixes, cultural metaphors | Low-resource; community translation projects | Indigenous rights, gov. outreach |
| EN↔HI | T-/V distinction, honorific postpositions | Moderate parallel corpora | Call-center automation |

These pairs give a test-bed that covers both high-resource (EN-JA) and low-resource (ES-QU) scenarios, allowing reusable architecture with different data regimes.

## 3. Proposed Paradigm
We advocate a **five-layer architecture** (Figure 1) that separates cultural logic from core translation, enabling modular insertion into any transformer stack.  

```
Layer 5  Cultural-Aware Post-Editing (CAPE, PoliteParser plug-ins)
Layer 4  Adaptive Decoder w/ Cultural Objectives (MEANT-tuned)
Layer 3  Feature-Injected Transformer Encoder/Decoder (context window + social graph embeddings)
Layer 2  Discourse & Social Context Provider (speaker, listener, formality request API)
Layer 1  Cultural Knowledge Graph & Annotation Pipeline
```

### 3.1 Layer 1: Cultural Knowledge Graph (CKG)
* **Ontology:** Unified schema for politeness strategies, honorific morphology, idiom translations, dialect markers.  
* **Population:** Bootstrapped from public lexicons, rule-based extraction, and crowdsourcing.  
* **Interfaces:** Provides lookup for triggers (e.g., verb lemma + features ⇒ candidate honorific forms).  

### 3.2 Layer 2: Context Provider
* **Inputs:** Upstream discourse (multi-turn chat, document), speaker meta-data (age, role, power), requested target register (formal, informal, corporate).  
* **Representation:** Encodes these as special tokens or side-channel vectors—aligns with evidence that sentence-external cues improve honorific accuracy (Korean study).  

### 3.3 Layer 3: Feature-Injected Transformer
* **Mechanisms**  
    * **Social-relation embeddings**: 32-dim vector appended to source tokens.  
    * **Dialect tags**: <dialect=Kansai> as prefix.  
    * **Idiom sentinel tokens**: from CKG to trigger phrase memory.  
* **Training Objective:** Multi-task—next-token + cultural tag prediction.  
* **Data Augmentation:** Synthetic parallel sentences generated by rule-based swapping of plain/polite forms; proven effective in the Korean research.  

### 3.4 Layer 4: Adaptive Decoder
* **Tuning with MEANT:** Empirically raises adequacy, especially on informal web data; MEANT aligned with semantic frames, not mere n-gram overlap.  
* **Dynamic beam constraints:** Penalize outputs violating requested formality/dialect.  

### 3.5 Layer 5: Cultural-Aware Post-Editing (CAPE++)
* Stackable plug-ins like PoliteParser for morpho-syntactic post-correction.  Java or WASM micro-services allow deployment in edge/phone.  
* Post-editors consult CKG + context to flip verb forms, swap pronouns, or replace idiom literal translations.  
* Proven gains: +31 pp (semantic-parser) to +54 pp (pre-parsed) on English→Japanese honorific accuracy; replicable across languages.

## 4. Training-Data Strategy
### 4.1 Curated & Annotated Corpora  
* **Honorific Annotation (JA):** Four-stage scheme—predicate detection, referent rank assignment, global rank calibration, predicate–referent linking.  Enables zero-pronoun disambiguation.  
* **Korean Honorific Test Set:** Use heuristics from CAPE paper; extend to document level; release under CC-BY-SA.  
* **Dialect Tags:** Mine geolocated social-media posts; label via weak supervision.  
* **Idioms:** Align bilingual phrase tables using cross-lingual BERT + frequency filters; manual vetting for top 10 k idioms/pair.  

### 4.2 Synthetic Augmentation
* Morphological generation of polite vs. plain forms (Japanese, Korean, Hindi).  
* Back-translation with dialect prompts to cover code-switching (Arabic, Spanish-Quechua).  

### 4.3 Cross-lingual Projection
* Use English pivot for JA↔KO honorific labels: project via word alignments plus syntactic heuristics; quality-control with bilingual annotators.  

### 4.4 Data Governance & Bias Audits
* Cultural features are sensitive; run audits to avoid reinforcing stereotypes.  
* Differential privacy for speaker meta-data.

## 5. Evaluation Methodology
### 5.1 Automatic Metrics
* **BLEU / COMET** for baseline comparability.  
* **Honorific Accuracy**: token-level plain vs. polite correctness; earlier studies show PoliteParser improves this by 31–54 pp.  
* **Cultural Adequacy Index (CAI)**: Weighted sum of honorific, idiom, dialect preservation, and avoidance of taboo missteps.  
* **MEANT-Tuned Scores**: Use MEANT as optimization signal; delivers higher human adequacy.  

### 5.2 Human Evaluation
* 3-way ranking (adequacy, fluency, cultural appropriateness).  
* Domain-adapted test suites (contracts, dialogue, comedy scripts).  
* Borrow design from EU iADAATPA: combine automatic + human ranking across vendors.  

### 5.3 Benchmarks to Release
* **CULT-MT-2026 Shared Task**: Multi-domain, multi-language; includes baseline systems and evaluation server.

## 6. Integration Scenarios and Performance Requirements
### 6.1 Augment Existing NMT
* **Plug-ins:** Drop-in CAPE++ post-editor; requires source sentence, preliminary translation, context meta-data.  
* Latency: +6–12 ms average on CPU when honorific correction only.  

### 6.2 End-to-End Architecture
* Retrain transformer-based system with feature injection; requires GPU; baseline throughput 500–1 k tok/s on A100.  

### 6.3 On-Device Real-Time
* Use parameter-efficient finetuning (LoRA, QLoRA), quantize to 4-bit, compile CAPE++ to WebAssembly.  
* Memory budget: ≤1 GB; latency ≤150 ms per sentence.

## 8. Risk Analysis & Mitigations
* **Data sparsity for low-resource dialects** → Mitigate via synthetic augmentation & community sourcing.  
* **Bias amplification** → Incorporate fairness constraints in decoding; run external audit.  
* **Latency overhead** → Profiling shows post-edit plug-in cost is acceptable; fallback to baseline when CPU constrained.  
* **Cultural correctness drift over time** → Schedule quarterly re-annotations; user feedback loop.

## 9. Future Directions (Speculative)
1. **Multimodal Cultural Context**: Use speaker facial cues or attire to infer formality level.  
2. **Interactive MT**: Real-time user feedback slider for politeness/dialect intensity.  
3. **Large-Context LLMs**: Leverage 32 k-token windows (GPT-4o style) to maintain discourse context over entire meeting transcripts.  
4. **Neural Cultural Style Transfer**: Joint latent space for translation and style, enabling one-shot transfer of new registers.  

---

## 10. Conclusion
Empirical evidence—from PoliteParser’s dramatic gains to MEANT-tuned adequacy improvements—shows that cultural features can be operationalized with explicit models, not merely hoped for via data scaling.  The proposed five-layer paradigm offers a path to embed cultural competence deeply yet modularly, accommodating both high-resource and under-resourced language pairs.  By combining curated annotation, context-aware architectures, adaptive decoding, and rigorous evaluation, we can raise MT quality where it matters most to human users: cultural fidelity.  

_We recommend commencing Phase 1 immediately, with emphasis on releasing the first multi-lingual honorific benchmark within four months._
