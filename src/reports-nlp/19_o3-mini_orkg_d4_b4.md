# Final Report: Mitigating First Name Biases in Large Language Models Using Few-Shot Prompting

## 1. Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, but persistent challenges remain in mitigating biases inherent in training data. A particular area of concern is the bias related to first names, where imbalances across demographic markers (e.g., gender, ethnicity, and cultural backgrounds) propagate skewed model outputs. This report details a multi-faceted investigation into mitigating first name biases in LLM outputs through few-shot prompting techniques. It synthesizes insights from a wide array of previous research, incorporating lessons from debiasing strategies at both the algorithmic and evaluation levels, and addresses cross-cultural and multi-lingual dimensions.

## 2. Context and Motivation

### 2.1. The Challenge of First Name Bias

First name bias in LLMs manifests in both classification and generative contexts. For instance, names common to certain demographics might be over-represented in biased predictions, whether the model is involved in question answering, dialogue generation, or classification tasks. This issue is compounded in datasets like the GAP dataset, where imbalances in name occurrence—especially in female subsets—yield distorted correlations between personal names and context (e.g., distances between pronouns and referents).

### 2.2. Objectives and Research Questions

The research outlined here addresses multiple questions:

- **Quantification vs. Mitigation:** While quantifying the magnitude of first name biases is essential, the primary focus is on developing few-shot prompting strategies that actively mitigate these biases.
- **Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks:** The work considers both conventional aggregate metrics (e.g., Matthews correlation coefficient, balanced accuracy, bookmaker informedness) and more granular metrics like the directional pairwise class confusion bias. Additional rank-based and cluster-sensitive evaluation measures are explored.
- **Cross-Linguistic and Cultural Dimensions:** Recognizing that first name biases might vary across languages and cultures, the research incorporates strategies to account for linguistic nuances, varying phonotactic patterns, and cultural associations, drawing inspiration from cross-lingual ASR studies and phonologically inspired back-off models.

## 3. Debiasing Strategies and Methodologies

### 3.1. Few-Shot Prompting Techniques

Few-shot prompting has emerged as a potent strategy for bias mitigation without intensive model fine-tuning. Recent research suggests that the selection and framing of in-context examples (shots) can impact the model's fairness in prediction. Advances include:

- **Demographically Sensitive Shot Selection:** New methodologies focus on selecting shots that represent a diverse mix of secondary attributes (e.g., race, gender), leveraging clustering-based heuristics to minimize cognitive bias. This multi-objective framework has shown efficacy in both zero-shot and few-shot regimes.

- **Integrative Prompt Design:** Few-shot prompting strategies must balance content fairness with targeted ranking metrics. The idea is to incorporate examples that counteract name-associated stereotypes while adhering to performance benchmarks relevant to both generative and classification tasks.

### 3.2. Joint Debiasing Across Social Identities

Joint debiasing strategies have been shown to be superior compared to independently treating each social bias. Studies indicate that simultaneously addressing biases related to race, gender, and religion can offer overall improvements. However, challenges remain in balancing these gains with potential trade-offs in model performance, as evidenced by debiasing–accuracy trade-off studies in toxicity detection tasks.

### 3.3. Reinforcement Learning-Based Debiasing

An innovative approach uses a model- and data-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL) agent to mitigate biases. The RL agent, when endowed with a carefully designed reward function, can achieve equalized odds without the need for access to internal model parameters. This RL-based debiaser has been demonstrated across multiple benchmark datasets and is particularly promising for production NLP systems.

### 3.4. Social Contact Debiasing (SCD)

Drawing on social psychological ideas such as the Contact Hypothesis, Social Contact Debiasing (SCD) simulates intergroup interactions using counterfactual datasets. Experiments with models like LLaMA 2, Tulu, and NousHermes yielded up to a 40% reduction in bias after a single instruction tuning epoch. The approach highlights the potential of incorporating unbiased response generation and social context simulation into instruction-tuning protocols.

## 4. Evaluation Metrics and Analytical Perspectives

### 4.1. Traditional vs. Granular Metrics

Conventional metrics such as the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and balanced accuracy provide an aggregate measure of model performance but may mask subtle, directional biases. An emerging metric, the directional pairwise class confusion bias, dissects pairwise decisions between classes, offering fine-grained insights into where first name biases manifest. This takes into account not only overall model performance but also the specific error patterns related to first name classifications.

### 4.2. Ranking Metrics and Weight Adjustments

Research from fairness-centric ranking suggests that methods such as PageRank adaptations, precision-at-rank, and direct metric maximization via reweighting can help correct over-representation issues. Comparative analyses in imbalanced data contexts underscore that weighting modifications—both intermediate schemes between micro and macro levels and granular pairwise evaluations—are critical for effectively mitigating bias, particularly when integrated into datasets like GAP.

### 4.3. Cross-Lingual and Phonological Considerations

Cross-linguistic variations are particularly relevant in name bias studies. For example, phonologically-informed back-off models used in ASR systems have successfully reduced error rates for foreign names without requiring separate phoneme models, suggesting that similar techniques could correct first name biases. This involves integrating phonotactic and phonosemantic analyses to account for language-specific morphological patterns and cultural naming conventions.

## 5. Integrative and Hybrid Approaches

### 5.1. Combining HITL and Automated Methods

Hybrid systems that integrate human-in-the-loop (HITL) strategies with automated debiasing have shown promise. For instance, iterative feedback loops allow domain experts to adjust instance selection where predictions are uncertain, thereby accelerating learning while maintaining fairness target metrics. Such systems often include discrete optimization routines and advanced hyperparameter tuning frameworks (e.g., ManyFairHPO) to systematically balance fairness and predictive performance.

### 5.2. Multi-Objective and Sequential Decision-Making Frameworks

In addition to few-shot and RL-based methods, new strategies involve sequential decision-making frameworks that account for the interdependence of multiple biases. Techniques such as debiasing contrastive learning (DCT) dynamically sample positive and negative examples to minimize biases in latent representations while preserving overall performance, offering robust out-of-distribution generalization.

### 5.3. Customization Across Contexts and Architectures

It is evident that no single approach serves as a silver bullet. The debiasing techniques described—be it few-shot prompting, SCD, RL agents, or hybrid optimization methods—are highly model and context dependent. Different pre-trained architecture families (e.g., GPT-4, BERT, LLaMA 2) may require tailored debiasing protocols, with special focus on persona adjustments, temperature tuning, and controlled exposure of first name examples to recalibrate model behavior.

## 6. Future Directions and Recommendations

### 6.1. Expanding Evaluation Frameworks

- **Developing Integrated Metrics:** There is a strong case for creating standardized evaluation frameworks that integrate aggregate and pairwise metrics. This could involve combining directional pairwise class confusion bias with re-weighted ranking metrics and incorporating insights from cross-domain studies on fairness in citation practices and page ranking.

- **Causal and Closed-form Analysis:** Advancing causal analysis techniques to decompose and correct for confounding, selection, and interaction biases could lead to more robust debiasing strategies. Techniques such as the Sample-to-Sample and Maximum Determinant methods provide promising avenues here.

### 6.2. Cross-Cultural and Multilingual Expansion

- **Adapting Phonologically-Informed Strategies:** Future research should further explore phonologically-inspired approaches to mitigate first name biases, ensuring that the techniques account for cultural and language-specific nuances without over-constraining model behavior.

- **Leveraging Multilingual Datasets:** Broader datasets that encapsulate diverse naming conventions and cross-cultural patterns will be crucial. Collaborative efforts around multilingual pretraining and phonotactic modeling—as seen with multilingual ASR systems—may inform better LLM debiasing protocols.

### 6.3. Integration of Human and Automated Oversight

- **Iterative HITL Methodologies:** Incorporating human feedback loops not only ensures dynamic monitoring but also provides expert-driven calibrations to prompt formulations, especially under conditions of ambiguous demographic representations.

- **Continuous Learning Systems:** The integration of fast debiasing frameworks using machine unlearning techniques and real-time RL decisions paves the way for more adaptive, production-ready debiasing systems that can respond to evolving societal norms and data distributions.

### 6.4. Emphasis on Persona and Temperature Tuning

Empirical findings from LLM voting experiments reveal that persona modifications and careful calibration of temperature settings can modulate both bias and diversity. Further research is recommended to optimize these parameters as part of a broader strategy to mitigate first name and corresponding social biases in LLM-generated outputs.

## 7. Conclusion

Mitigating first name biases in LLMs via few-shot prompting involves a carefully orchestrated blend of advanced prompting techniques, granular evaluation metrics, and integrative debiasing strategies that span reinforcement learning, social context simulation, and human-in-the-loop systems. The research synthesized in this report demonstrates that by combining multi-objective frameworks with cross-linguistic models and nuanced evaluation metrics, practitioners can achieve significant debiasing improvements—up to an observed 40% reduction in bias under certain conditions. As LLMs continue to be deployed in increasingly sensitive and high-stakes applications, the adoption of these advanced strategies will be essential for ensuring that model outputs align with equitable and accurate representations, ultimately advancing the state of AI fairness.

This report captures key insights from prior research and outlines several promising directions for future work. The interdisciplinary nature of these debiasing techniques—spanning statistical, linguistic, and human-centered approaches—underscores the need for continued innovation and collaboration to address the evolving challenges of bias in modern AI systems.
