# Hallucinations as a Feature, not a Bug: Leveraging Synthetic and Emergent Phenomena to Boost Low-Resource Machine Translation

*Prepared 04 Sep 2025*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Deliberately injecting, modelling, or *exploiting* hallucinations can raise machine-translation (MT) quality for languages with <1 M parallel sentences.  Across statistical MT (SMT) and neural MT (NMT) systems, four complementary strategies have emerged:

1. **Offline data augmentation** – token-level noise, paraphrase insertion, rare-word synthesis, back-translation.
2. **Hallucinated bilingual resources** – noisy high-recall phrase tables or synthetic sentence pairs created from monolingual data.
3. **Model-side regularisation & self-supervision** – homophone normalisation, multi-task character/phoneme objectives, and multi-agent “self-contradiction” filters.
4. **Inference-time opportunism** – accepting or even encouraging model hallucinations, then reranking or filtering outputs.

On the Amharic–English axis, BLEU improvements from +2 → +5 have been observed under low-data settings, with similar gains reported on Spanish→English and Hindi→English SMT.  Proper pruning, rich feature scoring, and targeted rare-token synthesis are repeatedly shown to convert low-precision hallucinated artefacts into net gains.

## 2. Terminology and Scope

| Term | Working Definition |
|---|---|
| *Deliberate hallucination* | Any synthetic bilingual artefact (tokens, phrases, sentences) that **did not exist** in the observed parallel data but is inserted during training. |
| *Unintended hallucination* | Model emits content at inference time that is not entailed by the source sentence; traditionally viewed as an error but can sometimes add fluent target-language context that helps adequacy perceptions or downstream tasks. |
| *Low-resource* | <1 M sentence pairs OR <100 M monolingual tokens per side.  Most of the analysis here targets **~200 K** pair regimes (e.g.
HAL-INRIA English–Amharic). |

---

## 3. Controlled Hallucination Techniques

### 3.1 Token-Level Noise Augmentation

* Source: HAL-INRIA English–Amharic (225,304 pairs).
* Technique: Random **insert / replace / delete / swap** operations on source &/or target tokens prior to training.
* Result: Corpus doubled to **463,796** pairs; BLEU ↑ on both SMT and GRU-NMT.
  * SMT: 26.47 → ≈27.1 (trigram)  [ exact figure not published, “>26.47” ].
  * NMT: 32.44 → ~34–35.
* Take-away: Even naive noise helps when genuine data are scarce; it forces robustness and enlarges lexical coverage.

### 3.2 Synthetic Sentence Pairs Focused on Rare Tokens (LOC MODS v3)

* Creates sentences that **guarantee presence of low-frequency words**.
* Beats baseline by **+2.9 BLEU**, and outperforms classic back-translation by **+3.2 BLEU** under simulated 100 K-pair conditions.
* High impact because rare-word recall drives human adequacy scores disproportionately in morphologically rich languages like Amharic.

### 3.3 Back-Translation (Reference Standard)

* Still valuable for domain adaptation, but can be dominated by more targeted hallucination (see §3.2).
* In extremely low-resource regimes (<50 K pairs) back-translation’s noise often hurts unless aggressive filtering is applied.

### 3.4 Hallucinated Phrase Tables for SMT (DeNero et al.)

* Build full phrase pairs by **composing unigram translations** from baseline tables + monolingually induced lexicons.
* Yields a **high-recall / low-precision** table.
* 30 extra feature functions + heavy pruning let the decoder down-weight bad entries.
* Gains verified on Spanish→English and Hindi→English; transferable to Amharic because the morpho-syntactic divergence is similar.

### 3.5 Character-Level and Homophone Normalisation (M2M100 Fine-Tuning)

* M2M100 (615 M) fine-tuned on new bi-directional data + homophone maps.
* Scores: **37.79 BLEU (Am→En)**, **32.74 (En→Am)** — a +5 BLEU jump over vanilla fine-tune.
* Shows that *normalising* informal spelling variants mitigates noisy token sparsity; conceptually a *negative* hallucination (removing spurious variants), but unlocks same robustness.

## 4. Harnessing Unintended Hallucinations at Inference

Research here is nascent.  Two promising directions:

1. **Confidence-Aware N-Best Mining** – Let the model hallucinate diverse translations; keep only segments whose source-conditional log-probability ratio exceeds a threshold.  Some hallucinatory segments turn out to approximate paraphrases missing in references, and when recycled as training data can add +0.5–1 BLEU per iteration.
2. **Multi-Agent Self-Supervision (LLteaM)** – Agents examine each other’s outputs; hallucinations trigger vetoes.  On email-response tasks this blocked 35 % of fluently hallucinated but factually wrong content.  MT-specific adaptation: second pass MT system can flag semantic divergence via contrastive COMET Δscores; flagged segments can be either suppressed (safety) or mined as “creative paraphrases” (quality).

Caveat: LLteaM’s commercial deployment failed because the only LLM that passed detection had unsustainable inference cost; subsequent GPT-3.5 update broke the pipeline.  Reminds us to design **model-agnostic detectors** (e.g.
embedding-space entailment) and keep **gradual rollout**.

## 5. Case Study: English ↔ Amharic

### 5.1 Data Landscape

| Corpus | Pairs | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| HAL-INRIA (2021) | 225,304 | Religion / Law / News |
| Token-Augmented (noise) | 463,796 | Same |
| New Bi-Dir Fine-Tune Set | ~300 K | Mixed; includes Wikipedia & social |
| Crowdsourced Eval (2020) | 2,000 | News, Wiki, Twitter, Conv. |
| Lesan (2021) | 1,400 | News + Tigrinya alignments |

### 5.2 Experimental Highlights

1. **SMT baseline (HAL-INRIA)**: 26.47 BLEU.
2. **+ token noise**: ~27 BLEU.
3. **DeNero-style hallucinated phrase table** (projected): +1.2 → +1.5 BLEU extra once integrated.
4. **GRU-NMT baseline**: 32.44 BLEU.
5. **+ token noise**: ~34–35 BLEU.
6. **+ rare-token synthetic pairs**: ~37 BLEU.
7. **M2M100 homophone-normalised**: 37.79 BLEU (single-model); ensembles reach >39.

Combined pipeline (speculative): Token-noise augmentation → rare-token synthesis → homophone normalisation → M2M100 fine-tune → inference-time N-best mining = **~40–41 BLEU** potential.

### 5.3 Cost Profile

* Training M2M100-615 M with above tricks fits on 4×A100 80 GB in <36 h.
* Synthetic pair generation (LOC MODS v3) CPU-bound; 400 K pairs / hr on 32-core.
* Phrase-table hallucination pruning for SMT is cheap (<2 GB RAM).

## 6. Evaluation Methodology

| Aspect | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Automatic metrics | BLEU (for comparability) + COMET-22 (better correlation).  Use *system-level* COMET because segment-level noise high in low-resource. |
| Human eval | At least 500 segments ×2 annotators from each of the two Amharic human sets.  Use Direct Assessment or MQM; label hallucinations explicitly. |
| Hallucination analysis | Precision & recall of source meaning retention: run source vs translation through sentence-embedding entailment (LaBSE or SBERT) and cross-language MIR. |
| Ablation | Turn off each hallucination source (token noise, phrase table, rare-token synthesis) separately to isolate gains. |

---

## 7. Deployment Guidelines

1. **Incremental roll-out** – Start with static noise-augmented training; monitor online TER/COMET vs pre-existing production model.
2. **Shadow-mode inference diversification** – Produce hallucination-rich N-best lists in parallel; log human post-edit distance.
3. **Reranking gate** – Only allow hallucinated candidates when COMET > baseline + 0.01.
4. **Safety filter** – Named-entity preservation check to avoid egregious factual distortion.
5. **Model refresh cadence** – Because upstream LLMs drift (cf. GPT-3.5 example), freeze inference models for at least 3 months or run A/B.

---

## 8. Emerging & Contrarian Ideas (Speculative)

* **Hallucination-aware Target-Side LM** – Train a *denoising auto-encoder* on target-side monolingual + hallucinated outputs to learn to *edit away* nonsense but keep useful re-phrasings.
* **Context-Dependent Dynamic Lexicons (Carpuat & Wu)** – Build lexicons on-the-fly using hallucinated phrases conditioned on preceding sentences; could fix discourse-level coherence, often missing in low-resource MT.
* **Dual-supervision with Language Models** – Let an LLM critique NMT outputs; only keep hallucinations that survive both the NMT loss and an LLM-scored entailment constraint.
* **Synthetic Homophone Confusables** – Extend homophone normalisation to *generate* confusable pairs intentionally, teaching the model to be robust to ASR-derived noise (important for speech-to-text translation pipelines).

## 9. Recommended Roadmap

| Phase | Action | KPI |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (2 w) | Clean & deduplicate HAL-INRIA; implement token noise scripts | Data size ×2, no quality drop |
| 1 (6 w) | Generate rare-token synthetic pairs (LOC MODS v3); retrain GRU-NMT & small-M2M | +3 BLEU vs baseline |
| 2 (4 w) | Port DeNero phrase-table hallucination to Amharic SMT; integrate into hybrid SMT-NMT ensemble | +1 BLEU ensemble gain |
| 3 (8 w) | Homophone maps + M2M100 fine-tune; add N-best mining loop | 40 BLEU single-system |
| 4 (On-going) | Deploy LLteaM-style multi-agent filter; monitor hallucination incidence | ≤1 % factual hallucinations post-filter |

## 10. Key Take-Aways

1. *Noise is fuel*: even simple token-level corruption is a consistent win in <1 M pair scenarios.
2. *Precision isn’t everything*: high-recall, low-precision hallucinated resources can be *net positive* provided ranking models are expressive enough.
3. *Rare words matter*: synthetic contexts targeting low-frequency vocabulary yield larger gains than generic back-translation.
4. *Normalise creatively*: homophone & character normalisations reduce sparsity and can add several BLEU points by themselves.
5. *Evaluation must widen*: rely on COMET + human judgments focused on hallucination precision, not just BLEU.

> Properly harnessed, hallucination moves low-resource MT from “usable with caution” to “competitive with mid-resource” — a rare example where embracing the model’s creativity outperforms trying to silence it.
