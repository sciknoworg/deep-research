## 1  Executive Summary
Large-language models (LLMs) still struggle with mathematically rigorous reasoning. Recent evidence suggests that **the bottleneck is not raw parameter count but adaptive memory**—the ability to store, retrieve and refine intermediate reasoning traces across tasks and time. We synthesize hardware, algorithmic and evaluation insights to outline a **self-improving memory module** that can be bolted onto existing or prototype LLMs. Key take-aways:

* **Energy-Delay Product (EDP) ↓50-70×** is achievable when arithmetic-heavy memory accesses are off-loaded to 22 nm near-memory compute (NMC) SRAM tiles.  
* **Continual consolidation algorithms** (MERLIN, ResCL, OCM) provide mathematically well-founded ways to update both short-term caches and long-term weights online with minimal catastrophic forgetting.  
* A **System-1 generator / System-2 verifier loop (CoRe)** can drive rapid self-improvement without external labels, boosting math benchmarks by ≈10 % in prior work.  
* Open-source enablers—LLAMA (data-layout virtualisation), Alive2 (verified optimisation), OpenRAM-BISR (self-repairing SRAM)—reduce integration risk.

> Flagged speculation: With coherent algorithm–hardware co-design, we project **one-shot theorem-proving accuracy on the MATH benchmark can push beyond 70 % within two years**, up from ≈45 % today.

## 2  Problem Statement & Scope
We target LLMs that must **reason mathematically over extended contexts**—symbolic manipulation, numeric multi-step problems, competition-style word problems and (eventually) formal theorem proving. The core research question is:

**How can an external, self-improving memory subsystem catalyse reasoning quality while preserving efficiency and continual-learning stability?**

Sub-questions we address:
1. Architectural design of the memory substrate.  
2. Online learning algorithms that govern write/read/consolidate.  
3. Hardware–software stack required for production deployment.  
4. Empirical methodology: which datasets, metrics, ablations?  

---
## 3  System-Level Vision
The envisaged system (Fig. 1) wraps an LLM core with four mutually-reinforcing controllers:

1. **Short-Term Memory (STM) Cache** – fast, writable, differentiable buffer (key-value or KNN).  
2. **Long-Term Memory (LTM) Bank** – slower but larger; periodically distilled into the backbone weights.  
3. **Verifier Module** – symbolic or neural proof checker that labels candidate solutions as valid/invalid.  
4. **Meta-Learner** – updates consolidation hyper-priors online (meta-distribution over weights `p(w|t)`).

## 4  Architectural Design Space
### 4.1 External Differentiable Memory
* **Neural Turing Machine-style** continuous addressing works well for few-k entries but scales poorly.  
* **Faiss/KNN replay**: cheaper, non-differentiable but admits sub-second retrieval over ≥10 M vectors.  
* Emerging trend: **dual-port SRAM caches** co-located with transformer blocks; high bandwidth for key/value look-ups.

### 4.2 Dual-Memory Controllers (Learning from 2023 ASU Thesis)
* One **writable cache** handles transient experiences.  
* A **static domain-specific weight bank** can be hot-swapped to adapt to task domains (e.g., algebra vs geometry).  
* Empirically solved both math-operation and color-sequence tasks without full re-training—evidence that memory can trigger **contextual weight binding**.

### 4.3 Near-/In-Memory Computing Substrates
* A 22 nm FDSOI SRAM tile delivered **52×–71× EDP reduction** (linear vs quadratic workloads).  
* Implication: host **vector-matrix multiply for arithmetic reasoning** inside memory arrays, turning memory look-ups into compute units.  
* (Speculation) Prototype with **reconfigurable Compute-In-Memory (CIM) arrays** where Fused Multiply-Accumulate (FMAC) on 8-bit words handles most transformer QKV ops for the memory module.

### 4.4 Reliability & Self-Healing SRAM (OpenRAM-BISR)
* Production ASICs can now include **Built-In Self-Repair**: spare rows/cols + remapping logic auto-patch defective cells.  
* This lowers NMC yield risk and makes academic-to-production silicon transition realistic.

## 5  Learning Algorithms for Continual Self-Improvement
### 5.1 Meta-Consolidation – MERLIN (2023)
* Treat each task-specific weight vector `w_t ~ p(w|t)`.
* Update the meta-distribution **after every data point** (fine-grained adaptation).  
* Outperformed five baselines on classic CL datasets; promising for few-shot math tasks where tasks shift rapidly.

### 5.2 Residual Continual Learning – ResCL (AAAI-20)
* Parameterises weights as `w = α·w_old + (1-α)·w_new`; avoids parameter growth.  
* Could be used during **LTM→LLM distillation**, preventing catastrophic overwrite.

### 5.3 Online Cooperative Memorization – OCM (ECCV-22)
* Couples STM and LTM via **optimal-transport formulation**; expands VAE mixture as needed.  
* Directly applicable to **generative math trace storage**: keep high-diversity solution sketches.

### 5.4 System-1 / System-2 Cooperative Reasoning (CoRe, 2022)
* Loop: generator proposes **latent reasoning chain** → verifier checks → feedback used as additional supervision.  
* Gains of **+9.8 % accuracy** on MATH-style benchmarks; critical for unsupervised self-improvement.

### 5.5 Retrieval-Augmented Generation Baselines
* `llm-math-education` provides an open pipeline: curate math snippets → embed → retrieve → concatenate with prompt.  
* Serves as a **baseline memory** before moving to learned controllers.

## 6  Hardware–Software Implementation Considerations
### 6.1 Data-Layout Virtualisation – LLAMA (C++17)
* One code base targets CPU/GPU/Many-core; important for mixed hardware where LLM core sits on GPU while memory accelerator on NMC ASIC.  
* Enables **rapid simulation** of different memory-placement strategies.

### 6.2 Verified Memory Optimisations – Alive2 (2021)
* LLVM optimisation passes can introduce subtle memory-model bugs (21 found).  
* Integrate Alive2 in the tool-chain that compiles memory-controller firmware to **guarantee correctness**.

## 7  Empirical Evaluation Protocol
### 7.1 Task Suite & Benchmarks
| Category | Example Benchmarks | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Symbolic manipulation | SymPy Gym, AlgebraTree | Low-level ops stress STM
| Numerical problem solving | GSM8K (extended), DeepMind N-digit | Good for verifier feedback loops
| Competition word problems | MATH, MATH+mix, NYS Grade-6 | Mix of natural language + math structures
| Theorem proving | miniF2F, ProofNet | Long-horizon credit assignment

### 7.2 Metrics
* **Accuracy** (top-1 & self-consistency).  
* **Forgetting Index** (FI) across curriculum.  
* **Memory Footprint / Token** (bytes).  
* **EDP** on critical kernels (measure on NMC silicon).  
* **Verifier Iterations to Convergence** (proxy for reasoning depth).

### 7.3 Ablations & Baselines
* LLM w/o external memory (control).  
* Retrieval-only RAG (no learning).  
* MERLIN vs ResCL vs OCM consolidation.  
* Hardware ablation: CPU-only vs GPU vs CIM-NMC.

Note: The NYS Grade-6 study where **plain MLR beat XGBoost** reminds us to include **simpler baselines**; do not assume complexity wins.

## 8  Expected Gains & Risk Analysis
### Projected Gains (speculative)
| Axis | 2024 Baseline | 2026 Target |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| MATH accuracy | 45 % | 70 % |
| Theorem-proof steps/token | 1.3× baseline | 2.0× |
| Energy/Query (128-step chain) | 1× | ≤0.02× (50×) |

### Key Risks
* **Memory–LLM bandwidth bottleneck** if NMC array not tightly coupled.  
* **Verifier cost explosion** for complex proofs ⇒ mitigate via caching verified lemmas.  
* **Hardware yield**—mitigated by BISR but still non-zero.  
* **Data privacy** when storing user-generated math traces.
