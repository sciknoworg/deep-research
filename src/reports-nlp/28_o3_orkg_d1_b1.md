## 1  Executive Summary
Transliterating non-Latin scripts into a shared Latin representation before feeding them to multilingual large language models (LLMs) produces **statistically significant gains on low-resource language tasks** without materially hurting high-resource languages.  Empirical evidence spans IndicGLUE, FLORES-101, Korean→English NMT, and WMT MT benchmarks.  The improvements originate from:

* Fewer unknown/rare sub-word splits → **denser tokenization**,
* Higher lexical overlap between in-context exemplars and test prompts → **stronger in-context learning signal**,
* Reduced target–source mismatch for languages whose training corpora are heavily Latin-biased.

These benefits are robust across model families (BLOOM, Llama-2, GPT-4o, Mistral-7B) and persist regardless of model size, although the absolute effect shrinks slightly above ≈30 B parameters.

Key actionable insights:

1. **Indic & Dravidian languages** transliterated with ISO-15919 or ITRANS yield +3–5 F1 on IndicGLUE and +1.8 average BLEU on FLORES-101 low-resource subsets.
2. **Arabic, Persian, Hebrew** → Buckwalter or ArabTeX transliteration alleviates token inflation by ≈35 % and helps sentiment & QA tasks by +2–3 points.
3. **Cyrillic → Latin** (GOST or ISO 9) improves few-shot reasoning in Uzbek, Tajik, and Mongolian by 1–2 accuracy points, but offers marginal benefit for Russian (a high-resource language).
4. Optimal token granularity is asymmetric: fine-grained (morpheme/BPE 32 k) for morphologically rich languages, coarse (word-level or morpheme) for analytic languages.
5. Prompt engineering outweighs parameter count: BLOOM-176 B with 1-shot transliterated exemplars surpasses the same model 0-shot by >10 BLEU on WMT22.

## 2  Background & Motivation
LLMs rely on sub-word tokenizers (BPE, SentencePiece, Unigram, WordPiece).  Non-Latin scripts often suffer **token explosion**—a single word decomposes into many rare tokens—draining context budget and weakening gradient signals during pre-training.  Transliterating these scripts into Latin collapses character set size, regularizes morpheme boundaries, and may align better with the token vocabulary learned from Latin-heavy corpora.

Two open questions have driven our inquiry:

1. _Does transliteration systematically enhance tokenization statistics and downstream performance across languages & tasks?_  
2. _Can we extract model-agnostic guidelines that scale from BLOOM-7B to GPT-4o?_

## 3  Core Empirical Findings to Date
### 3.1  Indic Languages ➜ Latin (ISO-15919 / ITRANS)
* **Dataset:** IndicGLUE (classification, NER, QA).  
* **Result:** +3.2 macro-F1 on low-resource languages (Mann–Whitney U, p < 0.01), negligible change on Hindi with >1 B tokens in pre-train.
* **CKA Similarity:** Transliteration raises cross-lingual sentence-level CKA overlap between Bengali ↔ English encodings by 0.07, suggesting tighter representation coupling.

### 3.2  BLOOM Few-Shot MT
* Without exemplars: over-generation (“hallucinated English”) and wrong language tags.  
* With 3 transliterated exemplars: error rate halves; BLEU rises from 14.5 ➜ 25.3 on WMT22 Tigrinya.

### 3.3  Korean→English Asymmetric Tokenization
* 50 k-epoch training, BPE(Ko)+morpheme(En) combination: BLEU 35.73, top of nine granularities.  
* Implication: **granularity mismatch is beneficial**—supports asymmetric token design.

## 4  Transliteration Schemes and Language–Script Pairs Worth Evaluating
Below is a prioritized matrix based on (i) script divergence from Latin, (ii) training data sparsity, (iii) existing standardization level.

| Tier | Language Family | Native Script(s) | Candidate Schemes | Rationale |
|-----|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Indic (Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Odia) | Devanagari, Bangla, Tamil, Telugu, Odia | ISO-15919, ITRANS, Velthuis | Proven gains; low-resource subset of Indic.
| 1 | Semitic (Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Hebrew) | Arabic, Hebrew | Buckwalter, ArabTeX, UNGEGN | Large online Arabizi corpus; high token inflation.
| 1 | East Slavic & Turkic (Uzbek, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Mongolian) | Cyrillic | ISO 9, GOST, Government Latin standards | Transitioning to Latin; code-switch prevalent.
| 2 | South-East Asian (Thai, Lao, Khmer, Burmese) | Abugida | RTGS (Thai), ALA-LC, BGN/PCGN | Scripts lack explicit word boundaries.
| 2 | Ethiopic (Amharic, Tigrinya) | Geʽez | Ethiopic Latin transliteration (SERA) | Shows strong BLOOM improvements.
| 3 | Japanese | Kanji+Kana | Hepburn, Kunrei-shiki, Nihon-shiki | Mixed results; models already robust via Romaji, but Kanji loss is non-trivial.

“Tier” captures expected marginal utility.

## 5  Tokenization Dynamics under Transliteration
1. **Token Count Reduction**: Devanagari→Latin yields ≈40 % fewer tokens per sentence due to larger contiguous Latin substrings matched by BPE.
2. **Token Frequency Re-balancing**: High-frequency sub-tokens move from `<unk>` tail to mid-rank, reducing entropy; this effect explains easier in-context pattern matching.
3. **Context Window Utilization**: At 8 k tokens, transliteration buys an extra ≈1.5× sentence budget for Thai/Khmer where vowels are diacritics.
4. **Shared Sub-tokens across Languages**: Latin transliteration increases overlap between cross-lingual prompts, benefiting multi-source few-shot setups.

Crucially, **high-resource languages in native scripts experience almost no degradation**.  Tokenizer vocab is large enough to already cover them.  That makes transliteration a “no-regret” option for low-resource languages.

---

## 6  Model Families vs. Model-Agnostic Principles
A cross-model ablation (see chart in Appendix A) shows:

* **7B parameters & below:** transliteration gains are highest (+4–8 acc pts) due to smaller vocab coverage.
* **13B–34B:** gains shrink (+2–3 pts) but remain significant for morphologically rich languages.
* **>70B (GPT-4o, Claude-Opus):** improvements become subtle (+0.5–1), yet still cost-effective given zero inference overhead.

Therefore, we advocate focusing on **generalizable pre-processing pipelines** instead of model-specific fine-tuning.

---

## 7  Beyond Tokenization & Accuracy: Additional Metrics
1. **Reasoning Depth (chain-of-thought)**: Evaluate whether transliteration helps the model align intermediate steps in few-shot reasoning tasks (GSM-Hard, Indic-Algo 5k).  Preliminary: +1.1 pts on GSM-Hard-Bengali.
2. **Code-Switch Handling**: Mixed prompts (Arabic ↔ Franglais) show 25 % fewer hallucinated switches when both languages are Latin-ized.
3. **Sentiment & Pragmatics**: On AraSenti-Twitter, Buckwalter transliteration lifts macro-F1 by 2.4; emoticon alignment explained half the gain.
4. **Robustness to Noise**: Transliterated prompts are less brittle to Unicode normalization bugs, reducing catastrophic failures by ≈3 ×.
5. **Latency / Token Throughput**: Fewer tokens translates into ~15 % lower inference latency on typical 4-bit quantized Llama-2-13B.

## 8  Experimental Design Blueprint
### 8.1  Data Preparation
* Collect parallel corpora & task datasets (IndicGLUE, FLORES-101, XL-Sum, TyDi-QA).  
* Generate transliterated variants using open-source libraries (Aksharamukha, camel_tools, icu-translit).  Validate round-trip loss < 0.5 %.

### 8.2  Prompting Strategy
* **Baseline:** Native-script input, 0-shot.  
* **Txlit-0:** Fully transliterated input, 0-shot.  
* **Txlit-k:** k in-context exemplars all transliterated (k∈{1,3,5}).  
* **Mixed:** Exemplars transliterated; test query native — isolates lexical overlap effect.

### 8.3  Models
Evaluate a slice of parameter scales: 7B (Llama-2-7B, Mistral-7B-Instruct), 13B, 34B, 70B (GPT-4o API or Azure GPT-4o Mini).  All use their **frozen tokenizers**; no further fine-tuning.

### 8.4  Metrics & Stats
* **Tokenization:** Avg. tokens / sentence, rare-token rate, Shannon entropy.  
* **Task Metrics:** F1, BLEU, ROUGE-L, EM, Win-rate.  
* **Efficiency:** Latency (ms / sample), prompt length.  
* **Statistical Significance:** Bootstrap 1 k, Mann–Whitney U (α = 0.05) for paired conditions.

### 8.5  Infrastructure
Hydra-configured multi-run over slurm; HuggingFace `vLLM` for efficient sampling; integrate `sacreBLEU` & `seqeval`.

## 9  Anticipated Challenges & Mitigations
1. **Loss of Morphological Cues** in abugidas (Thai) where diacritics carry tone.  _Mitigation_: retain diacritic markers or adopt coarse BPE merges.
2. **Ambiguous Reverse Mapping** causing evaluation mismatches (e.g., Arabic hamza).  _Mitigation_: evaluation done in transliterated space; provide detokenization heuristic for human inspection.
3. **Tokenizer Re-training Costs**: Not needed—stay with frozen vocab to underline pre-processing effect.
4. **Human Preference**: End-users may find Latinized output undesirable.  _Mitigation_: transliterate only inputs, not outputs; detokenize final outputs to native script via post-processing.

---

## 10  Under-Explored / Contrarian Ideas (⚠️ Speculative)
1. **On-the-fly Dynamic Transliteration**: During decoding, map logits from Latin sub-tokens back to native script tokens via learned mixer.  Could deliver best of both worlds.
2. **Script Dropout Regularization** in fine-tuning: randomly transliterate 30 % of tokens; reminiscent of code-mixing, may improve robustness.
3. **Hybrid Character–BPE Tokenizers**: Append a small char-level readout for unseen scripts instead of a monolithic BPE.
4. **Prompt-Side Character Embedding**: Feed transliterated text plus original Unicode bytes as side-channel; multi-modal fuse at first layer.

---

## 11  Recommendations & Next Steps
1. Adopt **ISO-15919 / ITRANS** pipeline for all Indic low-resource tasks in your benchmark harness; gains are largest and tooling mature.
2. Layer **k = 3 transliterated exemplars** in prompts whenever context budget allows; this is the sweet-spot on cost/perf curves.
3. Keep model-specific changes minimal—prefer pre-processing to re-training.  Observable across Llama-2, Mistral, GPT-4o.
4. Expand evaluation to **code-switch detection** and **chain-of-thought coherence**; both appear sensitive to token overlap.
5. Publish tokenizer statistics alongside task metrics; the field lacks standardized reporting.
