# Retrieval-Augmented Deductive Reasoning (RADR) Via Structural Decomposition of Legal Analysis

*Comprehensive Technical Report – 4 September 2025*

---

## 1  Executive Summary

Retrieval-Augmented Deductive Reasoning (RADR) seeks to marry large-scale information retrieval (IR) with fine-grained deductive/abductive reasoning so that legal work products (memos, briefs, risk opinions, contract redlines) can be generated or checked with simultaneously high recall and high doctrinal precision.  

This report synthesises historical systems (IKBALS, BankXX, GREBE, OUIXOTE), current LLM-centric toolchains, and emerging hybrid symbolic / neural techniques to propose a next-generation RADR architecture that explicitly decomposes legal analysis into four mutually-reinforcing strata:

1. **Issue Decomposition & Fact Typing**  
2. **Targeted Precedent & Authority Retrieval**  
3. **Normative Alignment & Conflict Resolution**  
4. **Argument Assembly & Draft Generation**  

We answer the scoping questions posed, map the design space, and recommend concrete experiments, datasets, and evaluation metrics for an initial‐to-advanced research programme.

## 2  Answers to Scoping Questions

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **Q1. Which portions of the legal reasoning workflow are you targeting?** | Primary: (i) *precedent alignment* (factor extraction, similarity, distinguishing), (ii) *statutory interpretation* (canons, temporal application, override rules). Secondary: rapid *issue spotting* and *argument strength estimation*. Full brief generation is *not* initially targeted but becomes feasible once strata 1–3 are reliable. |
| **Q2. Is the goal theoretical, prototyping, or benchmarking, and in which domains?** | A three-phase programme: **Phase I – Theoretical Formalism** (embed structural decomposition, factor hierarchies, and dialogical proof graphs). **Phase II – Working Prototype** (hybrid LLM + symbolic engine over US Federal courts and EU competition-law). **Phase III – Empirical Benchmarking** (compare to baseline retrieval & chain-of-thought systems across torts, bankruptcy, and civil-rights litigation). |
| **Q3. Data sources and substrates?** | **Retrieval:** (i) Harvard LIL CaseLaw Access Project (~6.7M US opinions); (ii) EUR-LEX; (iii) synthetic “edge-cases” generated via GPT-4o; (iv) optionally, partner-firm document management systems via vectorised entitlement layers. **Reasoning substrate:** (a) local Llama-3-70B-Instruct fine-tuned on legal domain; (b) Prolog / Answer-Set Programming for rule layers; (c) COLA-v2 factor graph embeddings for similarity heuristics. |

## 3  Background & Literature Integration

### 3.1  IKBALS (1993-1995)

• First distributed-agent litigation support; blended rule discovery, case-based reasoning (CBR), and IR.  
• Induced rules from *Accident Compensation Act 1989* then migrated to *Credit Act 1984*.  
• Out-performed blackboard systems CABARET & PROLEXS by fusing inductive rule learning with retrieval indices.

*Takeaway: agent-level architectural decomposition plus dynamic rule induction still matter; modern micro-services or serverless functions can mirror IKBALS’ agents for scalability.*

### 3.2  BankXX & GREBE (Multi-Index Precedent Retrieval)

• BankXX introduced five concurrent indices—citation, story, factor, family-resemblance, legal-theory—to boost heuristic precedent search in bankruptcy reorganisation.  
• GREBE’s **reduction-graph** attaches relevance to specific legal theories, not raw textual similarity, yielding explainable alignment.  

*Takeaway: Multi-indexing is essential for high-precision retrieval and offers intrinsic explainability. Modern vector stores (e.g., Vespa, Weaviate) can host parallel indices; cross-index concordance metrics can drive confidence scoring.*

### 3.3  OUIXOTE (Situation-Theory in Deductive OODB)

• Demonstrated that object-oriented DBMSs can run *situated* logic over legal precedents.  
• Bridged linguistic situation theory (context, entailment) with practical decision support.

*Takeaway: situational semantics are a precursor to “contextual windows” in LLM prompts; we can reinterpret OUIXOTE’s constructs as typed context objects passed to neural decoders.*

### 3.4  Convergence With Modern LLM Stack

• LLM chain-of-thought (CoT) resembles factor-based decomposition but remains opaque.  
• Prompt engineering alone under-delivers on statutory precision (canons, retroactivity, severability).  
• Therefore: explicit factor graphs + symbolic deductive checks *before* handing off to neural generators.

## 4  Targeted Workflow Components & Structural Decomposition

### 4.1  Stratum 1 – Issue Decomposition & Fact Typing

Goal: transform raw fact patterns (pleadings, discovery, contracts) into a structured representation (issue tree + typed fact clusters).

1. **Named-Entity & Event Extraction** via a legal-tuned BiLlama-CRF.  
2. **Canonical Fact Types** mapped to ontology (e.g., *Tort-Duty*, *K-Breach*, *Securities-Misstatement*).  
3. **Issue Tree Construction**: DAG where nodes = candidate causes of action / defences; edges = logical dependencies.

### 4.2  Stratum 2 – Targeted Precedent & Authority Retrieval

1. **Parallel Indices (BankXX-style):**  
   • Citation Graph Embeddings (CGE)  
   • Factor-Based Vectors (FBV)  
   • Narrative Embeddings (proto-story)  
   • Legal-Theory Taxon (Rule-based)  
   • Statutory Provision Anchors  
2. **Composite Relevance Score** = f(IndexScores, situational fit, novelty penalty).  
3. **Deduplicated Authority Bundle** rank-ordered for each issue-tree node.

### 4.3  Stratum 3 – Normative Alignment & Conflict Resolution

1. **Canonical Ruleset** built via inductive generalisation (IKBALS technique) from retrieved precedents.  
2. **Symbolic Reasoner** (ASP or defeasible logic) to test new fact pattern.  
3. **Conflict Graph** marking:  
   • Parallel authority splits (circuit splits, dissenting opinions).  
   • Temporal overrides (new statutes overruling case law).  
   • Policy-based distinctions (e.g., public policy exceptions).

### 4.4  Stratum 4 – Argument Assembly & Draft Generation

1. **Argument Scheme Selection** (e.g., argument from precedent, argument from policy).  
2. **LLM-Guided Narrative Templating** feeding “scaffold” paragraphs with embedded cite-check placeholders.  
3. **Traceability Matrix** linking each proposition in the draft to:  
   • Input fact,  
   • Rule node,  
   • Authority citation,  
   • Confidence score.

### 5.2  Key Components & Implementation Notes

| Component | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-Index Vector Store | Vespa.cc or LanceDB | Supports per-index scoring functions & hybrid term+vector retrieval. |
| Rule Induction | ILP (Aleph) or differentiable ILP (dILP) | Re-implements IKBALS’ rule extraction but can exploit GPU acceleration. |
| Symbolic Engine | s(CASP) or Clingo | Permits open-world defeasible reasoning & produces justification graphs. |
| LLM | Llama-3-70B-Instruct finetuned on SCOTUS + ECJ judgments | Local weights for confidentiality; use LoRA adapters for sub-domains. |
| Prompt Orchestration | Semantic-Kernel or LangChainJS | Enables multi-step reasoning / retrieval fusion. |

### 6.3  Experimental Variants

1. *No-symbolic* ablation: retrieval → LLM only.  
2. *Single-index* ablation: factor index only.  
3. *Rule-induction off*: hand-coded rules.  
4. *Adversarial prompts*: test hallucination resistance.

## 7  Anticipated Challenges & Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Sparse factor annotations in case law | Weak-supervision + active learning to iteratively label factors. |
| Hallucinated citations | Citation-verifier module using regex + DOI/API look-up before surfacing. |
| Jurisdictional conflicts | Hierarchical priority encoding (e.g., SCOTUS > Circuits > District; EU Reg > Dir > Nat Law). |
| Licensing constraints on commercial case data | Use CAP/EUR-LEX for open research; design swappable connectors for Westlaw, Lexis w/ on-prem compute. |
| Evaluation ground truth uncertainty (multiple right answers) | Use panel of practising attorneys; compute inter-rater reliability (κ ≥ 0.7). |

## 8  Novel Research Directions (Proactive Suggestions)

1. **Differentiable Retrieval Supervision:** fine-tune retriever + reasoner jointly via reinforcement learning (reward = symbolic proof success).  
2. **Factor-Graph Pre-training:** train a graph-neural network on citation networks + factor edges to embed *legal style* reasoning into the retriever.  
3. **Dynamic Authority Weighting via Litigation Analytics:** incorporate judge-specific citation preferences and motion-type success rates.  
4. **Zero-Trust Drafting:** integrate cryptographic provenance; each paragraph hash links back to underlying authority bundle.  
5. **Procedural Posture Predictor:** before retrieval, predict likely procedural stance (12(b)(6) vs summary judgment) to weight standards of review.

*(Items 1-5 involve moderate-to-high speculation; experimental.)*

## 10  Conclusions & Next Steps

• Historical systems prove that structural decomposition and hybrid reasoning boost legal decision support; modern LLMs resurrect these concepts at scale.  
• A RADR architecture that combines multi-index retrieval, inductive rule generation, and defeasible symbolic reasoning provides explainable, high-precision outputs.  
• Immediate payoff occurs in precedent alignment and statutory applicability; full brief generation remains a stretch target but becomes tractable with the proposed traceability matrix.

**Recommended Immediate Action:** stand up the retrieval layer (multi-index) and evaluate factor-index recall—experience shows that rapid wins here will secure stakeholder buy-in and yield the training data necessary for subsequent symbolic phases.
