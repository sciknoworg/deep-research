# Retrieval-Augmented Deductive Reasoning (RADR) Via Structural Decomposition of Legal Analysis

## Executive Summary
Retrieval-Augmented Deductive Reasoning (RADR) aims to combine the recall power of modern neural retrieval with the precision and transparency of symbolic legal reasoning.  Drawing on empirical findings from argument-technology, databases, and privacy scholarship, this report sets out (1) which legal tasks RADR should tackle first, (2) how best to decompose those tasks structurally, and (3) how to build an implementation that is jurisdictionally compliant and empirically evaluable.  We recommend a *layered* decomposition schema that stays just below the diminishing-returns threshold identified by Verheij et al. (2009) while remaining rich enough to support deductive, defeasible, and case-based inferences under a single umbrella.

## 1  Scope of RADR and Problem Statement
Large-scale language models are now able to retrieve semantically relevant passages from vast corpora, yet they remain brittle at step-wise legal reasoning.  RADR proposes to cure that brittleness by:
1. **Retrieving** authoritative snippets (statutes, cases, contracts, secondary sources) via dense embeddings and rule-induced indices.
2. **Structurally decomposing** the legal problem into argumentatively and logically tractable sub-tasks.
3. **Deductively or defeasibly solving** each sub-task with explicit rules, precedents, or argumentation schemes.
4. **Surfacing explanations** that are auditable by legal experts.

Our design must balance *granularity* (too coarse loses rigor; too fine loses usability) with *computational efficiency* and *jurisdiction-specific privacy constraints*.

## 2  Priority Legal Tasks and Document Genres

### 2.1  Selection Criteria
We ranked candidate tasks along five axes:
* **Value added by retrieval** (breadth of sources, language variance)
* **Amenability to structured decomposition** (argument regularity)
* **Data availability** (open corpora, license-free)
* **Commercial and research demand**
* **Regulatory / privacy sensitivity**

### 2.2  Recommended Priority Order
| Rank | Task / Genre | Rationale |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| 1    | **Case-law synthesis (common-law jurisdictions)** | Abundant data (open courts), high demand for precedent mapping. Neural retrieval already hits nDCG≈0.9 on Arabic corpora; likely higher with English corpora and legal SBERT.  Argumentative discourse exhibits semi-regular structure captured by CFG (Mochales & Moens 2008). |
| 2    | **Contract & Privacy-policy analysis** | Active doctrinal migration toward contract-based privacy governance; RADR can offer clause-level risk flags.  DSLs (Tilburg, Karlstad) allow machine-readable obligations that plug directly into deductive rules.  Data often proprietary but less personally sensitive. |
| 3    | **Statutory interpretation (sector-specific or territorial-scope issues)** | High jurisprudential complexity but enormous compliance value.  Sector-specific canons (Bisping 2012) benefit from retrieval-augmented identification of legislative context. |

Lower-priority tasks such as patent claim construction or intra-corporate policy harmonization can be phased in once the core pipeline stabilises.

## 3  Structural Decomposition Schema

### 3.1  Granularity Trade-off
Verheij et al. (2009): *moderate* structure boosts performance; **fully detailed predicate logic produced no extra gain**.  Therefore our schema must allow *graduated refinement*—start shallow, drill down on demand.

### 3.2  Proposed Layered Representation Stack
1. **IRAC-lite Snapshot** *(Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion)*  
   • Generated automatically from prompts or user query.  
   • Serves as navigational TOC.
2. **Argumentation Layer** — *Periodic Table of Arguments (PTA)*  
   • Parametric slots allow consistent classification (2024 study).  
   • Lives in an ASPIC+ container enabling defeasible exchanges among retrieved authorities.
3. **CFG Layer for Case Narratives**  
   • Borrow Mochales & Moens grammar to parse holdings, ratio, obiter.  
   • Provides mid-level anchors for citation alignment.
4. **Situational Predicate Layer (SM / OUIXOTE)**  
   • Only instantiated for sub-issues requiring full first-order rigour (e.g., statutory preconditions).  
   • Situations are first-class database objects amenable to retrieval.

This layered model lets RADR *progressively unfold* detail: most queries stop after layer 2; power-users drill to layer 4.

## 4  Implementation Architecture

### 4.1  Overall Pipeline
```
[Ingestion] → [Indexing] → [Retrieval] → [Structural Parsers] → [Reasoning Core] → [Explanation & UI]
```

### 4.2  Components and Technologies
1. **Ingestion & Normalisation**  
   • Bulk court APIs, EDGAR filings, scraped privacy policies.  
   • On-the-fly pseudonymisation to respect PII constraints.
2. **Indexing**  
   • Dual index: (a) dense PV-DBOW / SBERT vectors for semantic recall, (b) rule-induced sparse index (IKBALS style) for precision.  
   • Multi-lingual support: unify Arabic, EU, and US corpora.
3. **Retrieval Layer**  
   • Hybrid reranker (BM25 + vector).  
   • Contextual filters for jurisdiction, date, source authority.
4. **Structural Parsers**  
   • PTA annotator fine-tuned on newly released parametric dataset.  
   • CFG parser for judgments (Mochales grammar).  
   • Clause segmenter for contracts using spaCy custom tokens.
5. **Reasoning Core**  
   • ASPIC+ meta-layer glues heterogeneous modules.  
   • OUIXOTE embedded as a micro-service for FOL fragments.  
   • Defeasible rule injection via VISUR/RAR, enabling live debugging and user-edited exceptions.
6. **Explanation & Visualisation**  
   • Graphical argument maps (dot/mermaid).  
   • Interactive “drill-down” toggles controlling depth (layer 1→4).  
   • Audit log with provenance, citations, and date stamps.

### 4.3  Deployment Model
* Containerised micro-services (K8s) to isolate jurisdiction-specific data stores.  
* Reasoning-as-a-Service gateway exposing GraphQL endpoints.  
* Edge inference for privacy-sensitive locales: inference happens inside client VPC; only abstract graphs exit.

## 5  Jurisdictional & Data-Privacy Constraints

### 5.1  Contract-Centric Privacy Obligations
Scholarship (Chicago 2015; Tilburg 2022) shows privacy moving from public-law to consumer-contract doctrines.  Consequence: **contract clauses themselves become regulated data**.  RADR must therefore:
* Parse privacy clauses and **inherit their data-use constraints** into system policy.  
* Offer a compliance dashboard mapping each retrieved authority to permitted distribution tiers.

### 5.2  Technical Enforcements
* **Privacy Option Language DSL** (Karlstad 2023) compiled to *Open Policy Agent* rules.  
* Pseudonymise personal attributes on ingest; maintain salted hash for linkage tests.  
* Opt-in model for cross-border data transfer (GDPR Art. 49) baked into routing layer.

### 5.3  Research Data Transparency
Lessons from the Restatement replication: all empirical benchmarks must be *open-sourced with recoding protocols* to avoid miscoding scandals.  Provide a *Jupyter provenance notebook* with queries, filter settings, and random seeds.

## 6  Benchmarking & Evaluation

| Layer | Metric | Target Baseline |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Retrieval | nDCG@10, MRR | ≥0.90 (vector + rerank) |
| Argumentation (PTA) | Macro-F1 on scheme slots | ≥0.80 |
| Deductive Layer | Correct conclusion rate vs. gold | ≥0.85 |
| End-to-End | Human expert satisfaction (Likert) | >4/5 |

Ablation studies should vary layer activation to replicate Verheij’s diminishing-returns curve, validating that *moderate* detail is optimal.

## 7  Speculative & Contrarian Directions  *(flagged as conjecture)*
1. **LLM-Guided Rule Induction**: fine-tune GPT-x models to propose defeasible rules from clusters of retrievals, feeding them into ASPIC+ as tentative arguments.  May accelerate coverage but risks hallucination.  
2. **Sector-Specific Canon Generators**: auto-induce interpretive canons (e.g., telecom, fintech) from statute-citation graphs, aligning with Bisping’s call for contextual regimes.  
3. **Explainable Embeddings**: integrate “interpretability tokens” derived from PTA roles into the embedding space, bridging vector retrieval with symbolic features.  
4. **Edge-Law Reasoning Appliances**: deploy sealed hardware modules in law firms to run OUIXOTE locally, syncing only hash digests—maximises privacy but complicates patching.

## 8  Answers to Originally Posed Questions

**Q 1  Which legal reasoning tasks or document genres should RADR prioritise?**  
**A.** Begin with (i) case-law synthesis, (ii) contract / privacy-policy analysis, then (iii) sector-specific statutory interpretation.  They offer rich data and clear retrieval needs while staying within manageable privacy constraints.

**Q 2  What structural decomposition schema do you envision and at what granularity?**  
**A.** A four-layer stack: IRAC-lite → PTA argument schemes (moderate granularity) → CFG parsing for judgments → optional first-order ‘situations’ in OUIXOTE.  Empirical evidence shows this hits the sweet-spot before diminishing returns.

**Q 3  Is your interest mainly theoretical or implementation-oriented, and are there jurisdictional/privacy constraints?**  
**A.** The plan is implementation-oriented: concrete micro-service architecture, retrieval pipelines, and benchmarks, with GDPR/CPRA compliance, contractual privacy obligations, and open empirical protocols baked in.

2. **Baseline Retrieval** — index with SBERT-Legal; target nDCG>0.85. (Week 3-5)
3. **PTA Annotation Pilot** — label 1 k cases; train argument extractor; shoot for F1>0.70. (Week 5-7)
4. **ASPIC+ Integration** — port rules for misrepresentation and unilateral contract changes. (Week 7-9)
5. **Evaluation Sprint** — expert panel on 30 queries; refine granularity thresholds. (Week 9-12)

## 10  Conclusion
RADR’s success hinges on tuning structural granularity, fusing symbolic and neural methods, and embedding privacy constraints into its very ontology.  By starting with case-law and contracts, adopting a PTA-centric middle layer, and leveraging dense retrieval with explicit deductive databases, RADR can deliver explainable, reproducible, and jurisdiction-aware legal reasoning support that surpasses both black-box LLMs and brittle rule-based tools.
