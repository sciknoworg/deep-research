# Prompt–Evolution Strategies for Reducing Negation-Related Errors in Large Language Models (LLMs)

*Prepared 2025-09-04*

---

## 1  Executive Summary
Negation is one of the most stubborn sources of error in current large-language-model (LLM) pipelines.  It causes both **reasoning failures** (e.g., polarity inversion, scope errors, hallucinated contradictions) and **evaluation blind spots** (standard automatic metrics often miss the error).  This report synthesises recent research and proposes a comprehensive experimental programme—covering **manual prompt engineering and automated prompt evolution**—to systematically mitigate negation errors across NLI, QA, sentiment, fact-checking and generation tasks.  We intentionally remain agnostic to a single vendor and outline setups for GPT-4-Turbo, Claude 3, Llama-3-70B-Instruct, Mistral Large and other open-weight checkpoints.

## 2  Background & Problem Framing

### 2.1  Why Negation Is Hard
1. **Semantic scope**: determining which constituents fall under the negator ("not **only** the city but the suburbs" vs. "not **in** the city").
2. **Pragmatic licensing**: NPIs, double negation, litotes.
3. **Symbolic misalignment**: token‐level pre-training statistics bias models toward the dominant (usually affirmative) polarity.
4. **Evaluation opacity**: SOTA text-quality metrics largely ignore negation perturbations (cf. §3.3).

### 2.2  Empirical Evidence from Recent Work

| Year | Finding | Implication |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 2023 | Two new NLI datasets with explicit *entity* vs *role* negation distinctions revealed attention confusion ("Peter" ↔ "John").  A modified attention kernel restored SOTA accuracy on SNLI/MNLI *and* improved new benchmarks. | Negation interacts with **coreference and role labeling**; prompting strategies that foreground entities/roles may help. |
| 2021 | Bi-LSTM on Conan-Doyle corpus reached 93.34 F1 for joint cue + scope negation detection, beating rule-based & CRF baselines. | Lightweight sequence models can still supply **explainable negation signals**; can be used as auxiliary validators or re-rankers. |
| 2022 | Comparative study: BERTScore, BLEURT, NUBIA, MoverScore, Mark-Evaluate showed "no appropriate behaviour" under negation perturbation. | We must incorporate **task-specific probes** or human evaluation; otherwise false confidence persists. |

---

## 3  Research Gaps
1. **Prompt-level interventions** for negation remain under-systematised; studies focus on model fine-tuning or architectural tweaks, not on *prompt evolution*.
2. **Automated self-refining prompts** (meta-prompts, critique & revise loops) have not been benchmarked explicitly for negation robustness.
3. Lack of **cross-task consistency**: an approach that helps NLI sometimes degrades factual QA.
4. Scarcity of **open-weight baselines**; most negation studies rely on proprietary APIs, complicating reproducibility.

## 4  Proposed Experimental Matrix

### 4.1  Task/Benchmark Suite

1. Natural Language Inference (NLI)
   • **SNLI, MNLI** (baseline)
   • **e-NLI-Roles** (entity/role negation; 2023 release)
2. Question Answering (extractive + generative)
   • SQuAD-Neg (induced negation)
   • BoolQ & BoolQ-Neg
3. Sentiment & Stance
   • SST-2 (perturbed)
   • Conan-Doyle Negation Corpus (for diagnostics)
4. Fact-Checking / Claim Verification
   • FEVER, FEVER-Neg
5. Open-ended Generation
   • RealToxicityPrompts-Neg variant to test policy compliance under negation.

### 4.2  Model Families & Resource Regimes

| Tier | Models | Access Assumption |
|------|--------|------------------|
| Closed | GPT-4-Turbo (OpenAI), Claude 3 (Anthropic) | API only, higher cost, no gradient access. |
| Hybrid | Mistral Large, Gemini 1.5 Pro | API, but partial weight sharing in 2025. |
| Open | Llama-3-70B-Instruct, Mixtral-8x22B, Yi-34B-Chat | Weights available; can run LoRA or routing attention tweaks locally. |

This mix allows us to (i) measure ceiling performance, (ii) test low-cost replicability, (iii) check whether prompt evolution alone suffices or weight access is mandatory.

### 4.3  Prompt-Evolution Axes
1. **Manual refinement**
   • Negation-aware instruction templates ("Answer the following *without overlooking negations*…")
   • Entity/role disambiguation scaffolds ("Identify the subject and object first …")
2. **Automated / self-refining**
   • Critique-&-Revise loops (LLM judges its own answer for polarity mismatches)
   • Meta-prompt distillation (search over prompt space using genetic algorithms or reinforcement signals)
   • External validator coupling (BiLSTM checkpoint as lightweight negation detective; feedback to LLM)
3. **Hybrid** (human-in-the-loop plus search)

## 5  Methodology in Detail

### 5.1  Phase 0: Baseline Audit
Run each model on the task suite with a neutral generic prompt ("You are a helpful assistant.").  Record:
• Task-level accuracy/F1/EM
• Negation-specific error rate (by flagging items containing `not`, `never`, NPIs, etc.)
• Calibration curves (likelihood vs. correctness)

### 5.2  Phase 1: Manual Prompt Engineering
1. **Heuristic Catalogue**
   • Explicit negation cue reminders ("*Be particularly cautious with words like not, never, nobody.*")
   • Semantic decomposition ("First restate the claim in your own words, then decide true/false.")
2. Evaluate incremental gains, search for cross-task invariants.

### 5.3  Phase 2: Automated Prompt Evolution

We treat prompting as a search/optimisation problem:

Algorithm 1  (Self-Refine-Neg)
```
for generation_step in 1…T:
    draft ← LLM(prompt_current, task_input)
    critique ← LLM("Evaluate whether draft mishandles negation.")
    if critique has ISSUE:
        prompt_current ← update(prompt_current, critique)
    else break
```
Key metrics: convergence steps, compute cost, error reduction.

Variants:
• `GeneticPrompts` – maintain population; mutate by swapping cue phrases; fitness = neg-F1.
• `RL-Prompt` – policy gradient where reward = +1 correct on neg case, −1 incorrect on affirm case.

### 5.4  Phase 3: External Validator Loop
Feed model output to Bi-LSTM (93.34 F1 on Conan-Doyle) to flag polarity mismatch; if flagged, request regeneration with additional context.

### 5.5  Phase 4: Adversarial Stress Tests
Generate *counterfactual negation probes* using masked language modelling: replace affirmatives with negated forms while preserving truth label, à la Kaushik & Lipton (2019) but negation-focused.  Evaluate robustness delta.

## 6  Evaluation Protocol

### 6.1  Task Metrics
• NLI: Accuracy, Macro-F1, δ-Accuracy on negated subset.
• QA: Exact Match, F1, Neg-Flip-Rate (answer flips polarity incorrectly).
• Sentiment: Polarity accuracy, False-Negation Rate.
• Fact-Checking: FEVER score, Contradiction rate.

### 6.2  Negation-Focused Diagnostics
1. **Scope Detection**: Intersection-over-Union vs. human scope annotations (possible via Conan-Doyle dev set).
2. **Entity Role Confusion**: new e-NLI-Roles metrics: *Role-Swap Error*.

### 6.3  Meta-Metrics (Quality of Evaluation)
Because BLEURT/BERTScore fail on negation (§3), we incorporate:
• `NegBLEU`: BLEU but penalises polarity inversion n-grams.
• `HLE (Human-Linguist Evaluation)`: 200-sample manual audit.

---

## 7  Expected Outcomes & Hypotheses (Flagged Speculative)
1. Manual prompts that *isolate negation cues* will yield **5-8 pp accuracy gains** on negation subsets for GPT-class models. (*medium confidence*)
2. Automated Self-Refine loops will approach manual performance with **lower variance** but **2-3× compute cost**.  (*speculative*)
3. Open-weight Llama-3-70B with a lightweight *modified attention* (entity/role aware) **plus** refined prompts may close ~80 % of the gap to GPT-4-Turbo on negation tests.  (*high variance; requires attention kernel patching*)
4. Incorporating the Bi-LSTM validator will reduce hallucinated polarity inversions by **≈30 %** while incurring negligible latency (< 40 ms per call).  (*empirical basis: validator F1 93 %*)

## 8  Implementation Considerations

### 8.1  Cost Envelope
| Layer | API Calls / 1k queries | Dollar Cost (2025 rates) |
|-------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Phase 0 baseline | 1 | $0.40 (GPT-4T), $0.20 (Claude 3), $0.03 (Llama-3 local infra) |
| Phase 2 Self-Refine (avg 3 loops) | 3 | ×3 multiplier |
| External Bi-LSTM | negligible (runs local) |

We recommend caching and asynchronous batch processing.

### 8.2  Ethical & Safety Aspects
Negation prompts can inadvertently bypass policy filters (e.g., "**never** build a bomb" advice).  We must integrate policy compliance checks after each evolution loop.

### 8.3  Reproducibility
All *open* models and code (prompt search, validator, datasets) will be released under MIT license; proprietary API results will be logged with metadata for later replication when weights become available.

## 9  Risk Analysis & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Over-fitting to superficial negation tokens | Medium | Models fail on implicit negation ("hardly", "seldom") | Include diverse cue lexicon; adversarial generation. |
| API provider prompt-format drift | High | Breaks automated loops | Use model telemetry to auto-detect failure; fallback to open-weight models. |
| Evaluation bias due to faulty metric | High | Wrong conclusions | Human spot-checks; use NegBLEU and diagnostics. |

## 10  Conclusions & Next Steps
Prompt evolution—both manual and automated—offers a **model-agnostic lever** to curb negation-related errors without expensive fine-tuning.  By combining:
1. Negation-aware scaffolds,
2. Self-refine loops,
3. External lightweight validators,
we expect substantial robustness gains across NLI, QA, sentiment and fact-checking.

Immediate next actions:
1. Finalise benchmark splits (ensure licence compliance for e-NLI-Roles).
2. Build open-source toolkit `NegPromptLab` (search, metrics, datasets).
3. Launch baseline runs on Llama-3-70B and GPT-4-Turbo; draft comparative report within two weeks.

Longer-term, integrate modified attention mechanisms into open models, perhaps via routing bias or LoRA adapters, to synergise with prompt-level advances.
