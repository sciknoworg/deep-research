# Final Report: Simulating Novice Coding (Mis-)Behaviors with Large Language Models

## 1. Introduction

The role of large language models (LLMs) in programming education has evolved significantly, not only in facilitating code generation but also in simulating realistic novice coding behaviors—both correct and erroneous. This report delves into the multifaceted research surrounding the simulation of novice coding misbehaviors using LLMs. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis that spans the identification of error types, the methodology for evaluating LLM performance (both in generating errors and in correcting them), and the relevant benchmarks for multi-language and framework environments. We further integrate insights from diverse research learnings, spanning inherent biases in code generation to innovative approaches such as dual LLM systems and interactive educational frameworks. This detailed analysis is designed for experts in the field, offering multiple layers of insights and actionable pathways for future research and practical applications.

## 2. Types of Novice Coding Misbehaviors and Their Simulation

### 2.1. Syntactic and Semantic Errors

One of the primary concerns in LLM-generated code is the replication of both syntactic and semantic errors. Research indicates that due to the over-reliance on frequent examples in the training corpus and anchoring biases (as observed in studies around OpenAI’s Codex), LLMs tend to generate predictable mistakes. Specifically:

- **Syntactic Errors:** These errors include misplacements, missing semicolons, improperly closed brackets, and other language-specific quirks that arise from misinterpreted grammar rules. Research has used AST-based explainability techniques (e.g., ASTxplainer) to dissect how such errors can systematically emerge.
- **Semantic Misunderstandings:** These involve logical errors wherein the code compiles without syntax errors but does not perform as intended. This aspect of misbehavior is often problematic because it requires deeper contextual recognition and reasoning about distant relationships in code segments. The stack-and-finetune approach analogous to second language acquisition (as demonstrated by Duolingo) shows promise in modeling these nuanced error distributions.

### 2.2. Inefficient Patterns and Cognitive Bias Replication

Besides syntactic and semantic errors, LLMs often replicate inefficient coding patterns typically associated with novice programmers, such as redundancy, lack of modularity, or poor optimization. This inefficiency is particularly evident where cognitive biases—stemming from the model’s training on vast repositories of both novice and expert code—affect error generation. The studies indicate that these biases range widely: while errors might manifest with high frequency (31.45% to 79.93% in some functions), targeted mitigation strategies can reduce biased outputs to as low as 0.4%–4.57% depending on the interventions.

### 2.3. Simulating Novelty Across Different Frameworks

An essential aspect of research is determining whether novice misbehavior simulations should be language-specific or span multiple programming environments. Findings from diverse studies, including the use of Learning Automata (LA) models and decentralized tutoring systems, affirm that error patterns exhibit significant variation depending on the programming language and framework. For example, simulations in Python have leveraged dual LLM systems (such as CORE’s proposer and ranker design) to focus on syntactic repairs and more rigorous semantic analysis, achieving correction rates up to 59.2% for Python code and nearly parity with specialized repair tools in Java.

## 3. Evaluating LLM Capabilities: Generation Versus Correction

A critical dimension in this research is deciding whether the LLM’s primary task will be to generate novice misbehaviors on demand or to proactively correct them. Each pathway has distinct benchmarks and challenges:

### 3.1. Generation of Misbehaviors

Generating realistic novice misbehaviors involves capturing the nuances of inexperienced coding. This simulation can be beneficial for:

- **Testing Error Resilience:** By intentionally introducing common errors, educational platforms can benchmark both the LLM and the learner’s ability to detect and fix mistakes. 
- **Adaptive Learning:** Systems like TeachYou and CSEPrompts already leverage LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, LaMDA) to craft coding exercises that reflect common pitfalls encountered by novices. 
- **Bias Simulation:** Given the inherent bias in LLM-generated code reported to vary from 31.45% to nearly 80%, generating misbehaviors can serve as a controlled environment for testing bias reduction techniques and their impact on functionality.

### 3.2. Correction and Benchmarking

Correcting code errors not only provides insight through immediate remediation but also builds on long-term retention through adaptive feedback. Research such as CORE’s dual LLM system combines a proposer for static analysis and a developer-like rubric-based ranker that corrects errors in real time. With achievements like 59.2% correction in Python and a 25.8% reduction in false positives, the integrated model suggests a robust avenue for using LLMs in both error simulation and remediation. Empirical evidence also supports that error correction systems like TEGCER, which use dense neural networks trained on extensive error-repair examples, significantly speed up the novice’s learning process—up to 25% faster than human-assisted tutoring. Benchmarking these systems should therefore incorporate both short-term logistical benefits and long-term conceptual retention metrics.

## 4. Integration of Novel Educational and Cognitive Modeling Approaches

Beyond traditional generation and correction paradigms, additional research highlights several hybrid and innovative approaches:

### 4.1. Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Strategies

The effective replication of novice error patterns has been bolstered by transfer learning strategies like stack-and-finetune approaches. These methods enable LLMs to incorporate distant contextual relationships in code, thereby simulating realistic novice-level errors. This is particularly relevant when errors span both local syntax and broader semantic structures.

### 4.2. Learning in Conversation (LIC) and Teachable Agents

Emerging frameworks such as Learning In Conversation (LIC) and LLM-based teachable agents, exemplified by AlgoBo, represent a forward-thinking approach to autonomous, continuous learning. By employing intent recognition and tailored prompting pipelines, these systems can encourage knowledge-dense interactions while simultaneously restraining over-competence. Such duality allows for both the generation of novice-level misbehaviors and their subsequent correction, coupling interactive learning with refined error mitigation.

### 4.3. Dual LLM Strategies and Expert-Inspired Approaches

The CORE system’s dual LLM design—comprising a static analysis-driven proposer and a rubric-based ranker—demonstrates significant promise. When evaluating and correcting code, this comprehensive approach not only mitigates errors but also leverages insights from expert troubleshooting. In some cases, cognitive biases (for example, the observation where expert schema fixation sometimes renders novices more effective at error detection) can be incorporated to develop counterintuitive remedial protocols that mimic both novice mistakes and expert corrections.

### 4.4. Collaborative and Decentralized Learning Models

Another innovative approach is the incorporation of Learning Automata to simulate collaborative learning scenarios where both teacher and student engage in the exchange of action probability vectors. This decentralized model of error simulation and correction can be particularly effective in environments that support multiple programming languages and frameworks, enhancing resilience against individual model biases and promoting a broader range of error types.

## 5. Comparative Benchmarks and Future Directions

### 5.1. Benchmarking Across Languages and Frameworks

Current research has shown that while Python-centric systems have achieved substantial correction success, Java-based evaluations report nearly comparable performance with specialized repair tools. It is essential to design benchmarks that reflect language-specific nuances. Collaborative grading systems (such as CORE and TEGCER) that integrate AST-based analyses alongside static tools provide granular insight into both syntactic and semantic performance metrics. Future benchmarks should consider diversity in error classification systems beyond traditional compiler diagnostics, incorporating human-tutor feedback and longitudinal learning outcomes as well.

### 5.2. Novel Simulation Strategies

Anticipating future needs entails exploring contrarian and novel strategies:

- **Hybrid Statistical and Expert-Driven Models:** Combining statistical models (like Markov Logic) with AST-based explainability increases fidelity in simulating error patterns. This duality can be further enhanced by integrating counterintuitive methods inspired by novice approaches in expert troubleshooting scenarios.
- **Dynamic Cognitive Bias Modeling:** Future simulation systems could dynamically adjust based on evolving understandings of cognitive biases in both novices and experts. This approach would allow for the real-time alignment of simulated misbehaviors with actual novice coding patterns.
- **Multimodal Feedback Systems:** Integrating diverse feedback modalities—automated and human-reviewed—will help refine error correction systems. Adaptive feedback, as evidenced by large-scale empirical experiments, should be calibrated to balance immediate logistic improvements with long-term conceptual retention.

### 5.3. Speculative and Forecasting Innovations

While current systems offer robust baseline performances, the next generation of LLM-driven coding simulators might incorporate:

- **Real-Time Collaborative Debugging Environments:** Integrated platforms where LLMs simulate both sides of a student-mentor dialogue in error generation and remediation.
- **Holistic Cognitive Simulation Models:** These models would blend psychological research with language modeling to predict and simulate learning trajectories for novice coders, possibly introducing predictive analytics for error-prone areas in curriculum design.
- **Integration of Cross-Domain Learning:** Leveraging insights from fields such as clinical coding error classifications and electronics troubleshooting could yield innovative cross-disciplinary strategies to model and correct novice coding behaviors more effectively.

## 6. Conclusion

The simulation of novice coding misbehaviors using large language models presents a multifaceted challenge that spans technical, educational, and cognitive domains. This report has synthesized all available research learnings—from addressing inherent biases and leveraging fine-tuning strategies to integrating innovative dual LLM designs and decentralized collaborative models. By considering both the generation and correction of novice errors, future systems can be better calibrated to enhance educational outcomes across diverse programming environments. The adoption of hybrid methodologies, dynamic feedback models, and interdisciplinary approaches will be instrumental in bridging the gap between automated error simulation and effective, real-world coding education.

In summary, while the current state of the art already presents robust models and frameworks, the path forward should involve incorporating novel evaluation strategies, expanding cross-language applicability, and deploying systemic countermeasures against cognitive and statistical biases. Such advancements promise significant improvements in how novice coders learn, adapt, and ultimately achieve proficiency in programming.
