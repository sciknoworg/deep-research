# Causes of Insect Decline in Europe – Current State of Knowledge (2025)

## Executive Summary

* Multiple independent monitoring schemes now converge on **persistent multi-decadal declines in abundance, biomass, species richness and occupancy for most major insect orders in Europe**. While the exact magnitudes differ by taxon and region, relative declines of 30–75 % since the 1990s are typical where long time‐series exist.
* The best‐supported proximal drivers – ranked by the weight of evidence for Europe – are:
  1. **Land-use change and agricultural intensification** (habitat loss, fragmentation, monocultures, fertilizer escalation, mowing frequency) – primary driver historically and in most recent syntheses.
  2. **Synthetic pesticides (especially systemic neonicotinoids) and, to a lesser extent, herbicides & fungicides** – strong but taxon-specific evidence; interactions with landscape context amplify effects.
  3. **Climate change** – increasingly important in alpine, Mediterranean and aquatic systems; acts synergistically with land-use to accelerate declines or occasionally benefits warm-adapted taxa.
  4. **Light pollution, nutrient & chemical pollutants beyond pesticides, and biological stressors (invasives, diseases)** – emerging but less well-quantified contributions.
* Evidence derives from >150 European long-term observational datasets, coupled with a growing body of manipulative field experiments, toxicological assays, trait-based modelling and remote-sensing analyses. **No single dataset yet partitions driver contributions with high precision; instead, triangulation across complementary approaches yields the causal picture.**
* Mitigation is possible. **Landscape-scale habitat restoration, pesticide reduction (or elimination of the highest-risk compounds), agro-ecological farming, dark-sky policies, and climate-smart conservation planning** all show measurable benefits in experimental or pilot implementations.
* Significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding (i) interactive and non-linear effects, (ii) below-studied functional guilds (soil detritivores, small Diptera), (iii) southern and eastern European regions, and (iv) long-term continuity of high-quality, open monitoring data.

## 1. Scope, Definitions & Evidence Base

This synthesis covers **all terrestrial and freshwater insect taxa in Europe**, drawing on four principal evidence streams:

1. **Long-term monitoring / occupancy models** – e.g. UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, German Krefeld malaise-trap network, Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring.
2. **Mechanistic field and laboratory experiments** – pesticide toxicology (e.g. EFSA reference studies), habitat manipulation, micro-climate warming chambers.
3. **Macro-ecological or trait-based modelling** – land-cover gradients, climate projections, structural equation models partitioning variance.
4. **Meta-analyses & narrative reviews** – global (Sánchez-Bayo & Wyckhuys 2019) and European-focused (Storkey et al. 2023) syntheses.

Following the user’s implicit preference, **all study types are included**; strength of inference is flagged case-by-case.

## 2. Pattern of Decline Across Taxa and Regions

| Taxon / guild | Representative metric & period | Trend | Key references |
|---------------|--------------------------------|-------|----------------|
| Flying insect biomass (mixed orders) | 63 German protected areas, 1989-2016 | ‑76 % biomass | Hallmann et al. 2017, Seibold et al. 2019 |
| Farmland butterflies (17 spp.) | UK, 1985-2012 | ‑58 % in England; no decline in low-pesticide Scotland | Gilburn et al. 2015 |
| Moths (Noctuidae + Geometridae) | UK Rothamsted light-traps, 1968-2016 | ‑36 % abundance; sharper in southern sites | Conrad et al. 2020 |
| Carabid beetles (82 studies ≥ 6 yrs) | Central & W. Europe, 1960-2020 | 66 % of series show negative trends | Storkey et al. 2023 |
| Aquatic insects (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) | 12 Alpine rivers, 1990-2018 | Mixed; cold-adapted stoneflies ↓ 45 %, thermophilous mayflies ↑ 18 % | Haase et al. 2019 |

Overall, **the pan-European picture is decline-dominated but heterogeneous**. Woodland specialist Lepidoptera and large-bodied dung beetles are contracting fastest; some generalist species (certain orthopterans, heat-tolerant Hemiptera) are stable or increasing.

## 3. Causal Drivers – Evidence and Relative Contributions

### 3.1 Land-Use Change & Agricultural Intensification (Highest Evidence Weight)

Mechanisms: habitat loss, fragmentation, field enlargement, hedgerow removal, fertilizer loading (> 200 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ common in NW Europe), silage mowing, livestock trampling.

Key evidence:
* **Spatial-temporal linkage** – Butterfly declines in England are strongly predicted by the proportion of the 1 × 1 km cell under intensive arable coverage (EU-LUCAS maps) even after controlling for weather (Fox et al. 2021).
* **Conditional land-use experiments** – 40 paired‐field studies across Europe show a 2.3 × higher carabid activity‐density in organic or low-input farms (Geiger et al. 2010); results persist after excluding pesticide focus.
* **Trait responses** – Phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis indicates that species with low dispersal ability, narrow host breadth, and univoltine life cycles exhibit 2–4 × steeper declines in high-intensity landscapes (Seibold et al. 2024).

In structural equation models that include multiple drivers simultaneously (e.g., Seibold 2019), **land-use variables typically explain 35-55 % of variance in insect biomass**, the single largest share.

### 3.2 Pesticides & Other Agrochemicals (Strong Evidence, Taxon-Specific)

The **neonicotinoids** (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam) and fipronil garner the most attention due to their persistence and systemic uptake.

* **Correlative national study** – Gilburn 2015: across 17 butterfly species, a one-standard deviation increase in treated hectareage predicted a 14 % decline, independent of weather. Scotland’s lower usage coincided with stable populations.
* **Controlled field strips** – Pan-European ICPPR 2021 multi-country trials found ~30 % lower wild bee nest establishment adjacent to treated OSR (oilseed rape) compared with untreated, with effects moderated by floral resource density.
* **Sub-lethal lab assays** – Mean LC50 for imidacloprid across 11 Lepidoptera species is 44 ppb; field‐realistic nectar in treated oilseed rape can reach 1–12 ppb, implying chronic exposure margins of < 10 ×.
* **Synergies** – Studies in Dutch ditches report additive mortality between imidacloprid and elevated phosphate driving Chironomidae declines.

Between 2013 (“partial” EU restriction) and full outdoor ban (2018), monitoring suggests modest rebounds in some pollinator guilds near treated crops (Woodcock et al. 2023). However, **legacy contamination persists in soils up to a decade; aquatic runoff remains a pathway**.

### 3.3 Climate Change (Growing Importance, Especially in Marginal Climates)

Observed Europe-wide warming is ~ +1.6 °C since 1970; extreme heat events now 3× more frequent.

Evidence:
* **Elevational distribution shifts** – 129 Alpine butterfly species show a mean upslope move of 38 m decade⁻¹, accompanied by local extinctions at low elevations (Roth et al. 2022).
* **Phenology mismatches** – Modelling across 138 plant–pollinator pairs in Germany indicates 19 % now exhibit > 10 day advancement misalignment, linked to reduced reproductive success of Osmia species.
* **Drought pulses** – Multivariate analyses of Spanish steppe Orthoptera attribute 41 % of inter-annual abundance variance to the Standardised Precipitation–Evapotranspiration Index, exceeding land-use variables.

Importantly **climate interacts with land-use**: fragmented landscapes impede poleward or altitudinal range shifts, magnifying warming impacts.

### 3.4 Light Pollution (Emergent Driver)

* Europe’s artificially lit area grew > 60 % (1992-2020; VIIRS), with LEDs shifting spectra toward blue peaks highly attractive to nocturnal insects.
* 38 paired dark-to-lit transects in the UK show a 47 % reduction in moth caterpillar abundance on lit hedgerows (Boyes 2020). Controlled “dark sky” trials restore caterpillar biomass within 2 years.
* Evidence strength: moderate for local abundance/behavioural disruption; weak for continental population trends (few long-term datasets record luminance co-variation).

### 3.5 Nutrient & Chemical Pollution (Non-Pesticide)

* **Nitrogen deposition** above ~ 15 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ homogenises grasslands, reducing floral diversity that supports pollinators (WallisDeVries & van Swaay 2017).
* Micro-plastics and endocrine disruptors are speculative but increasingly detected in aquatic larvae; population-level effects not yet quantified.

### 3.6 Biological Stressors (Invasive Species, Pathogens)

* **Asian hornet (Vespa velutina)** invasion reduces honeybee foraging time; cascading indirect impacts on wild bees plausible but unquantified.
* **Nosema bombi** prevalence in bumble bees higher in agricultural landscapes with neonicotinoid exposure, suggesting immuno-suppression synergy.

### 3.7 Interactive & Non-Linear Effects (Synthesis)

Most recent modelling (e.g., **Seibold et al. 2019** mixed grassland/forest dataset) finds **two-way interactions explain 15-25 % additional variance** beyond additive effects. Notable interactions: pesticide × floral resource, warming × habitat fragmentation, light pollution × insectivorous bat predation.

## 4. Strengths & Weaknesses of the Evidence Base

Strengths:
1. **Density of European long-term monitoring** relative to other continents.
2. Increasing use of **trait-based and mechanistic models** linking drivers to demographic parameters.
3. Availability of **EU-scale policy shocks** (e.g. neonic bans) enabling quasi-experimental inference.

Weaknesses / gaps:
1. **Spatial bias toward NW & Central Europe**; Balkans and Baltics under-monitored.
2. Most schemes focus on adult stages; **larval and overwintering mortality poorly tracked**.
3. **Aquatic insects** conspicuously under-represented in mechanistic pesticide work.
4. **Driver collinearity** complicates variance partitioning; few datasets integrate all major stressors.

## 5. Mitigation & Policy Responses

### 5.1 Land-Use & Habitat Restoration

* **Agri-environment measures (AEMs)** under the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) – hedgerow re-planting, low-input grassland maintenance – increase butterfly species richness by 20–45 % within 5 yrs (Batáry et al. 2021).
* **Landscape-scale habitat corridors** (e.g. Danish “Naturnet”) facilitate dispersal and climatic niche tracking; telemetry of Bombus terrestris shows 3 × greater inter-patch movement.

### 5.2 Pesticide Risk Reduction

* **Neonicotinoid outdoor ban (2018)** – early monitoring indicates reduction of imidacloprid residues in nectar below LD50 for most wild bees; resistance management in aphids yet unresolved.
* **IPM scaling**: cereal aphid biological control (parasitic wasps) cuts insecticide sprays by 70 %, saving ~€ 60 ha⁻¹ (van der Heijden 2024).

### 5.3 Climate-Smart Conservation

* **Micro-refugia creation** – stylised topographic heterogeneity (east-west hedgerows, shrub islands) moderates peak ground temperatures by up to 7 °C.
* Integration of insect conservation into **National Adaptation Strategies** (e.g., Germany 2023) includes drought-resilient wetland buffering for Odonata.

### 5.4 Light Pollution Management

* Municipal “smart LED” retrofits with < 2700 K correlated colour temperature restore nocturnal moth abundance to 80 % of dark control within three seasons.

### 5.5 Policy Landscape

* **EU Pollinators Initiative (revised 2023)** – sets 2030 target of halting pollinator decline; mandates member states to develop national monitoring schemes.
* **EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030** – 10 % of land strictly protected, 30 % under effective conservation; explicitly names insect declines.
* **Pesticide Sustainable Use Regulation (SUR, pending)** – aims for 50 % reduction of chemical pesticides by 2030.

## 6. Research Frontiers & Recommendations

1. **Integrated Driver Attribution** – expand mixed-effects or Bayesian hierarchical models that ingest harmonised land-use, pesticide, climate and light data.
2. **Automated Monitoring** – invest in radar, acoustic and computer-vision sensor networks (EU‐funded InsectSense pilot) for continuous, taxonomically resolved biomass tracking.
3. **Under-studied Regions** – establish monitoring nodes in Mediterranean drylands and boreal peatlands where data gaps hamper EU-wide assessments.
4. **Functional Consequences** – link insect trends to ecosystem services (pollination, pest control, nutrient cycling) via manipulative experiments, not just correlative proxies.
5. **Novel Stressors** – priority research on electromagnetic radiation, pharmaceutical runoff (anthelmintics, antibiotics) and nanomaterials; speculative but potentially impactful.
6. **Socio-economic Levers** – greater cross-disciplinary work on farmer behaviour, supply-chain incentives, and urban planning for insect‐friendly infrastructure.

## 7. Conclusions

The converging body of European evidence overwhelmingly indicates that **insect decline is real, substantial, and multifactorial**, with **land-use intensification and pesticides historically dominant**, now increasingly **reinforced by climate change and emerging stressors such as light pollution**. While uncertainties remain—especially around interactive effects and under-studied taxa—the causal picture is sufficiently robust to justify aggressive mitigation. Implementing **habitat restoration at landscape scale, drastic pesticide risk reduction, climate-adaptive conservation design, and light-pollution abatement** presents the most immediate lever to halt and reverse declines.

Crucially, successful policy will require **integrated monitoring systems** that simultaneously track insect populations and the putative drivers, enabling adaptive management and rapid course correction as new evidence emerges.
