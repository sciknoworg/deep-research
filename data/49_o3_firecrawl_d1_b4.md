# When Is Mowing More Efficient than Grazing in Restoring Plant Diversity – and Why?

*A synthesis of >50 empirical studies, meta-analyses, and long-term trials (1968-2024)*

## 1  Problem Framing and Scope
Restoring or maintaining plant diversity in semi-natural open habitats of the Holarctic is typically achieved through biomass removal, historically provided by free-roaming or low-input livestock. Yet in many landscapes, grazing is no longer socio-economically viable, while tractor-based mowing (or mowing–baling) is logistically easier to schedule and less dependent on stock availability. Practitioners therefore ask whether mowing can **match or even exceed** the biodiversity benefits of low-intensity grazing, and under which ecological and management contexts this is realistic.  

This report synthesises **all published quantitative evidence we located up to February 2025** (≥35 temperate grassland studies, 20 Mediterranean shrubland trials, and 11 long-term experiments >10 yr), with an emphasis on plant community responses but also drawing on key invertebrate indicators (pollinator and orthopteran guilds) that often covary with structural or floral diversity.

Key guiding questions were:
1. Ecosystem & climate type: Temperate lowland/montane grasslands, Mediterranean macchia & shrublands, coastal dunes, urban lawns, salt marshes.
2. Treatment comparison: tractor mowing (1–3 × yr, various cut dates) **versus** extensive grazing (≤1.5 livestock units ha⁻¹; continuous or rotational), occasionally plus abandonment controls.
3. Diversity metrics: (i) total vascular plant richness; (ii) indicator/threatened species presence; (iii) functional or structural heterogeneity (sward height Mosaic Index, C:N ratio, flower density).
4. Temporal horizon: short (≤6 yr), medium (7–15 yr), and long (>30 yr).

## 2  Headline Findings

| Evidence tier | Main message |
|---------------|--------------|
| Global/continental meta-analyses (Tälle 2016; Schneider & Hering 2024) | Grazing tends to outperform mowing **on average**, but the effect size is small to moderate (d ≈ –0.2 to –0.3) and disappears when plot sizes ≥10 m² are analysed. |
| Mediterranean shrublands (20 site meta-analysis, Oikonomou 2023; Sardinia & S-France case studies) | **Mowing after initial shrub clearance yields 35–45 % higher target-plant richness** than comparable low-density goat/cattle grazing, especially for geophytes and annual composites. |
| Mountain grasslands (C-European Alps & Carpathians) | Mowing is marginally better (d = +0.19) than grazing for overall plant richness, and critical for mowing-adapted threatened species (e.g., Gladiolus imbricatus). |
| Aggressive-grass reversal experiments (Hu, It) | Bi-annual mowing can suppress Calamagrostis epigejos and Brachypodium rupestre by 80–96 % within a decade, re-opening microsites for small forb recruitment — an outcome not achieved by low-stocking grazing alone. |
| Urban/suburban greenspaces | Reduced-frequency mowing (2–3 wk in turf) maximises lawn-flower density and bee visitation relative to weekly mowing; grazing is usually not an option. |

In brief, **mowing becomes the more efficient tool whenever**:
1. **Shrub or robust tussock grasses dominate** early succession and need a pulse disturbance that grazing animals avoid or cannot control adequately.
2. **Selective herbivory threatens focal species**, i.e. stock preferentially consume the very plants we want to promote.
3. **Uniform low sward height is *not* the goal,** but rather a reset to early-successional herb layer followed by heterogeneous regrowth.
4. **Logistical or animal-welfare constraints** prevent keeping livestock at the optimal (often very low) density over large, discontinuous parcels.

## 3  Mechanistic Rationale: How Mowing Differs from Grazing

| Process | Grazing | Mowing |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Biomass removal timing | Continuous or rotational; phenology-coupled consumption | Discrete events; full sward cut typically 1 × (late-June/July) or 2 × year |
| Selectivity | Species-, height-, and nutrient-selective; avoids spiny or toxic taxa | Non-selective within cutting height; high evenness of cut |
| Trampling & patch creation | Soil compaction, creation of gaps, dung patches (nutrient hot-spots) | None (unless heavy machinery on wet soils) |
| Nutrient export | Partial (grazed biomass circulates via dung/urine) | Near-total export if hay removed; depletes soil P & K over years |
| Propagule dispersal | Endozoochory, epizoochory | Negligible or negative (machinery hygiene) |

The above contrasts imply that mowing:
• **Removes more nutrients per unit biomass**, gradually lowering fertility and competitive dominance of tall grasses.  
• Can **set back ligneous resprouting** more drastically (stem cut at ground level every year) than low-intensity browsing.  
• Lacks animal selectivity – advantageous when livestock would over-browse palatable rare forbs (e.g. *Gladiolus imbricatus*, *Gentianella repens*) or under-graze spiny shrubs (*Quercus coccifera*, *Paliurus* spp.).  
• Must be **timed carefully** to avoid removing flowering/seed set of target plants or insects.

## 4  Context-Specific Evidence

### 4.1 Mediterranean Shrublands and Macchia
* **Sardinia coastal slopes (Mesléard 2017)** – After one-off mechanical clearing, a **single spring mow** each April for six years cut *Phillyrea angustifolia* seedling density by 75 % and brought orchid/sage assemblage to 78 % similarity with reference plots. Goat/cattle grazing (short-term high density) restored only 30 % of indicator taxa and allowed 4× higher shrub recruitment.
* **Kermes oak maquis, Hérault (9-yr trial)** – Annual August mowing kept *Quercus coccifera* cover <10 %, lifted herb-layer richness from 20→63 species incl. *Thymus vulgaris*, while goat grazing left >40 % shrub cover and <25 species.
* **Meta-analysis of 20 Med sites (Oikonomou 2023)** – Mean log-response ratio +0.35 (≈42 % gain) in mowing over grazing for target-plant richness, strongest for geophytes and annual Asteraceae. Confidence interval did **not** overlap zero.

Why? Livestock avoid or minimally browse resprouting shrub shoots and geophyte foliage with high fibre or toxins; mowing imposes full top-kill and curtails bud bank size while exporting the biomass (nutrient drain).

### 4.2 Mountainous and Alpine Semi-Natural Grasslands
* Meta-analysis sub-group shows a small but significant advantage of mowing (d = +0.185).  
* *Gladiolus imbricatus* case: late-July single cut maintained flowering population; sheep grazing removed 100 % inflorescences, suppressing recruitment.  
* **Brachypodium rupestre** (Italian Alps) & **Calamagrostis epigejos** (Pannonian basin): Two cuts per year reduced dominant grass cover by 80–96 % within a decade. Evenness increased, and pastoral value improved by +6.5 units when Rhinanthus (parasitic forb) sowing or low NPK fertilisation accompanied mowing.

### 4.3 Lowland Temperate Grasslands and Coastal Dunes
Contrasting trend: **grazing usually outperforms mowing** (Tälle 2016; d ≈ –0.193 in lowlands, –0.266 in calcareous dunes). Mechanisms involve dung-mediated microsite creation and selective removal that favours short, stress-tolerant forbs.

### 4.4 Salt-Marshes and Hydric Grasslands (Long-Term)**
A 48-yr Dutch salt-marsh experiment: late-season mowing alone eventually lost 11 species vs baseline; early-season mowing or low-density (≤0.5 LU ha⁻¹) cattle grazing maintained diversity. Interpretation: late cut allowed litter accumulation and shading for most of the growing season.

### 4.5 Urban/Suburban Turf Grass Landscapes
Weekly mowing reduces floral resources to near zero. Lerman 2018 showed **bee abundance peaks at 2-wk**, while 3-wk mowing produced 2.5× more lawn flowers; grazing in these contexts is impractical, so mowing regime choice dictates outcome.

### 4.6 Cross-Taxon Invertebrate Perspective
Grasshopper study (Germany, 10 yr) revealed highest Orthoptera richness at lenient cattle grazing (12 cm mean sward). However, mowing can simulate this heterogeneity by **alternating cut/no-cut strips** – a practice rarely tested but promising.

Large-scale butterfly dataset (DEBMS) indicates that beyond 0.5 LSU ha⁻¹ specialist species decline; hence, if grazing cannot be kept <0.5 LSU consistently, a mosaic mowing schedule may better conserve specialists.

## 5  Decision Matrix: When to Favour Mowing

| Criterion | Choose Mowing If … | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------|
| Target vegetation | Shrub-encroached macchia, young maquis, tall monocultures of *Calamagrostis*, *Brachypodium* | Mowing imposes full top-kill, homogenises light, exports nutrients |
| Focal species | Palatable orchids, tall forbs (*Gladiolus*, *Gentiana*) vulnerable to grazing | Avoids selective herbivory |
| Soil fertility | High P/K legacy from past agriculture | Hay export accelerates nutrient impoverishment |
| Accessibility | Small, fragmented parcels where fencing or herding is costly | Tractor/brush-cutter easier to deploy |
| Public perception | Urban parks, recreation areas | Livestock presence less acceptable; mowing noise less contentious |
| Climate extremes | Very arid summers – forage quality insufficient for stock | Mechanical cut decouples biomass removal from forage value |

Conversely, **retain or introduce grazing** when: heterogeneity, truncated sward, and seed dispersal are desired; soil is wet (machinery damage risk); or large, contiguous areas allow very low densities.

## 6  Best-Practice Guidelines for a Biodiversity-Friendly Mowing Regime
1. **Cut Timing** – Align first cut *after* peak flowering/seed set of target plants but *before* late-season litter smothering. In moist grasslands this often means early July, whereas Mediterranean systems benefit from late August cuts to hit shrub resprouts.
2. **Frequency** – One cut suffices in nutrient-poor or Mediterranean sites; two cuts (June + September) are needed where competitive tall grasses dominate. Longer-term goal: reduce to 1× once nutrient status has declined.
3. **Spatial Mosaic** – Leave 10–20 % uncut refuge strips or rotating uncut blocks annually to benefit invertebrates (orthopterans, pollinators) and small mammals.
4. **Blade Height** – 6–8 cm stump height in grasslands; 3–5 cm in shrub encroached plots to deplete bud bank. Avoid scalping which damages soil seed bank.
5. **Biomass Disposal** – Remove hay/bio-mass within 3–5 days to prevent nutrient re-leaching; compost or use as low-input fodder.
6. **Supplementary Measures** – a) **Hay transfer** from species-rich donor sites re-introduces propagules; b) Sowing hemi-parasites (e.g., *Rhinanthus minor*) speeds competitive release of forbs; c) Spot-spraying resprouts of clonal shrubs (if chemical use acceptable).

## 7  Emerging & Contrarian Solutions
(The following suggestions are flagged as *speculative* – robust field validation pending.)

• **Autonomous electric micro-mowers** (e.g., solar-charged ‘sheep-bot’) that operate on irregular paths could mimic selective grazing patterns without livestock, potentially combining advantages of both tools.  
• **Drone-guided precision mulching**: LIDAR-equipped drones map shrub hotspots; robotic brush-cutters treat only those patches, reducing disturbance area by ≥70 % (pilot data, Navarra 2024).  
• **Bio-char mulching** post-mow: applying 1–2 t ha⁻¹ powdered bio-char after mow shown (López et al. 2023, unpubl.) to adsorb excess soil P, tipping competitive balance toward stress-tolerant forbs.  
• **Manipulated herbivore cues** – spraying synthetic sheep saliva compounds post-mow to trigger compensatory tillering in grasses, creating microgaps for forb seedlings (lab evidence only).  
• **Herbicide-assisted selective mowing** (‘mow & swipe’) targeting re-sprouting stumps of *Prunus*, *Rubus* reduces shrub recovery by an additional 60 % with 90 % lower herbicide volume than broadcast spraying.

## 8  Monitoring & Adaptive Feedback
1. **Plant Surveys** – α-diversity (species per 25 m²) every 2 yr; β-diversity (Bray-Curtis) across treatment blocks.  
2. **Functional Indicators** – Ellenberg N value mean, sward height CV, live : dead biomass ratio.  
3. **Invertebrate Metrics** – Pollinator visitation counts on 4 × 10 m transects; orthopteran sweep counts mid-July.  
4. **Soil Nutrients** – Olsen P and exchangeable K every 5 yr to confirm declining trend under biomass export.  
5. **Decision Rule** – If target richness plateaus (< +1 sp yr⁻¹) and sward still >70 % high-competitor grasses, escalate to 2nd annual cut or integrate short-duration cattle pulsing.

---

## 9  Research Gaps
• Lack of factorial experiments that **combine grazing and partial mowing** (e.g., graze May–June; mow August).  
• Under-representation of **Eastern European steppes** and **Asian meadow steppes** in meta-analyses.  
• Quantification of **propagule dispersal deficits** under long-term mowing (loss of zoochory) and its mitigation via hay transfer.  
• Interactions with **climate change** – augmented drought may shift optimal cut dates earlier; models scarce.

---

## 10  Conclusions
1. On average across Europe, grazing remains *slightly* superior to mowing for plant diversity, but the margin is modest and highly context-dependent.
2. **Mediterranean shrublands, montane grasslands with grazing-sensitive forbs, and sites dominated by robust clonal grasses are clear cases where mowing outperforms grazing** in both speed and magnitude of plant diversity recovery.
3. Mechanistically, the superiority stems from (i) non-selective biomass removal, (ii) higher nutrient export, and (iii) stronger control of woody/clonal competitors.
4. Optimal biodiversity restoration often lies in **combining the two tools** in space or time rather than in exclusive reliance on one.
5. Managers should base tool choice on explicit objectives, site fertility, accessibility, and social license, incorporating adaptive monitoring to tweak frequency and timing.

> **Bottom line:** Where shrub resprouting or tall-grass dominance suppresses early-successional or palatable rare forbs, and where very low, heterogeneous grazing pressure cannot be sustained, a carefully timed mowing regime – preferably with biomass removal and refuge strips – will be the more efficient, cost-effective route to restoring high plant (and associated insect) diversity.
