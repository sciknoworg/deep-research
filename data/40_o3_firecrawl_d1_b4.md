## 1. Executive summary

Calcareous soils – rendzinas, calcareous fens, semi-dry to xeric grasslands and thin forest rendzic leptosols – harbour some of the botanically richest communities in Europe (up to 70 vascular species m⁻²).  Their persistence and restoration are increasingly understood to hinge on below-ground biota rather than on the classic trio of **pH, CaCO₃ and low fertility** alone.  The compiled evidence, spanning 2002-2024 field experiments, long-term trials and meta-analyses, leads to six overarching conclusions:

1. **Soil microbial community structure, especially the fungal: bacterial biomass ratio and arbuscular-mycorrhizal (AMF) composition, tracks – and can locally limit – plant alpha-diversity.**  High-diversity grassland cores show both higher AMF biomass and closer plant–fungus compositional matching than tree-influenced edges.
2. **Management overrides edaphic chemistry.**  Mowing, grazing intensity and historical nutrient inputs reshape plant–soil feedbacks within 2–3 years, whereas subtle timing shifts require ≥20 years to manifest.
3. **Legacy effects are paramount.**  Gene diversity in extant plant populations aligns with 19th-century grassland configuration rather than present soil traits, implying co-legacy of soil biota and seed banks.
4. **Restoration is slowed by negative plant–soil feedbacks from early colonisers and by excessive farmyard manure (FYM).**  Where NPK is ceased, fungal-leaning soils develop but full target community assembly still needs >20 years.
5. **Fungal inoculation works under nutrient-poor, CaCO₃-rich contexts but its effectiveness is modulated by pot/plot volume, duration and host root traits.**  Triple-Glomus inocula increased C, N and P cycling by >45 % in Turkish calcareous soils, indicating potential for Central Europe if local strains are employed.
6. **Biodiversity gains do not automatically translate into multifunctionality.**  A landscape-scale seed addition in Germany raised plot richness yet altered only N-cycle related functions after four years, hinting at functional saturation once dominants are present.

## 2. Scope and approach

• Geographic focus: Central Europe sensu lato (UK, Germany, Czechia, Slovakia, Austria, Poland, Slovenia, Alpine France/Italy).  Peripheral Mediterranean and alpine case-studies are included where mechanistic insights are transferable.  
• Habitats: semi-dry to xeric calcareous grasslands (Festuco-Brometea), spring and valley fens on tufa, montane/alpine limestone screes, and calcareous upland meadows.  
• Biotic groups: AMF, general saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi, rhizosphere bacteria (incl. N-fixers), soil fauna (lesser emphasis due to data scarcity).  
• Evidence base: 7 controlled experiments, 4 long-term monitoring datasets, 3 restoration trials, 1,620-study meta-analysis and several landscape-scale observational studies.

## 3. Key findings by thematic axis

### 3.1 Plant diversity correlates with fungal dominance and AMF specificity

**Čertoryje Meadow (White Carpathians, CZ; Lepinay et al. 2024)**  
• Treeless patches with ≤70 vascular spp m⁻² carried higher SOC and total N **and** greater total fungal and AMF biomass/diversity than tree-edge zones.  
• Fungal/AMF community composition *mirrored* plant assemblages more tightly (Mantel R² ≈ 0.38) than bacterial communities (R² ≈ 0.12).  
→ Interpretation: plant–fungus co-sorting rather than bulk soil chemistry underpins micro-scale diversity hotspots.

**Colt Park, UK long-term trial (1990-2004; Smith et al. 2008)**  
• Stopping NPK inputs and seeding 60–70 spp increased the fungal: bacterial PLFA ratio and vascular richness; yet the MG3b target community was still absent after 14 yrs.  
• FYM at ≥72 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ kept soils bacterial-leaning and suppressed progress.  
→ A fungal-leaning trophic structure is necessary but not sufficient; propagule limitation and negative feedbacks from extant pioneers remain obstacles.

### 3.2 Management regime dictates speed and trajectory of change

**Seven spring-fen experiments, CZ & SK (2002-2022)**  
• Mowing cessation reduced combined vascular + bryophyte richness by up to **40 % within 2–3 yrs**.  Re-introducing even *single annual cuts* reversed losses.  
• Pure litter removal failed to compensate, underscoring the role of biomass export in keeping nutrient fluxes low and light at soil surface high.  

**Temporal lags**  
• While stopping/starting mowing shows near-immediate effects, **changing cut timing** (e.g. June + September vs. late-autumn) required ~20 yrs before composition shifted detectably – a critical caution for monitoring schemes.

**Calcareous fen grazing vs. mowing (Stammel et al. 2003)**  
• Cattle (0.7–3.2 AU ha⁻¹) lowered total richness and favoured grasses and stoloniferous clonal forms; autumn mowing favoured non-clonal rosette forbs.  
• Fen specialists’ proportion remained unaffected, suggesting trait filters more than species loss per se.

### 3.3 Weak direct link between abiotic chemistry and richness

**Estonian calcareous grasslands (Hallikma et al. 2023)**  
• Despite higher pH, organic matter and total N in some sites, neither biomass productivity nor forage quality predicted species numbers.  
→ Nutrient stoichiometry and biotic feedbacks override gross fertility measures.

**Alpine limestone screes (PLOS ONE 2017)**  
• AMF diversity correlated with exchangeable Ca, K, CEC and slope, yet **not** with plant composition.  Under extreme edaphic stress, geomorphology more than vegetation drives fungal assemblages.

### 3.4 Legacy effects eclipse current conditions

**German calcareous fragments (Reisch et al. 2017)**  
• Nei’s gene diversity of *Carlina vulgaris* matched 1830 grassland distances, not present soil traits or population size.  
→ Historical land-use imprints on soil biota and seed banks constrain today’s restoration ceiling.

### 3.5 Priority effects and negative plant–soil feedbacks

**UK clay-rendzina mesocosms (Fry et al. 2017)**  
• Low-fertility soils with fungal-leaning microbiomes allowed target species establishment; but early coloniser grasses/forbs later generated negative feedbacks blocking newcomers ≥8 yrs.  
• Introduction of the root hemiparasite *Rhinanthus minor* failed to undo conditioned priority effects.

### 3.6 Experimental AMF inoculation – opportunities and caveats

**SE Turkey calcareous soils (Heliyon 2024)**  
• Triple-**Glomus** inoculum (intraradices + constrictum + microcarpum) lowered CaCO₃ by 24 %, lifted microbial biomass C to 1,176 mg C kg⁻¹ and pushed root AMF colonisation to 92 %.  Root fresh weight rose 49 %.  
• Demonstrates that even in Ca-rich matrices, AMF can enhance nutrient cycling and growth when appropriately matched.

**Meta-analysis of 1,620 pot trials (Qin et al. 2022)**  
• Effect size controlled 45 % by duration (>150 d), root:shoot ratio and pot volume (1–2.9 kg) – **not** by AMF richness.  
• For field translation, long-duration (>1 season) and host trait screening matter more than inoculum species count.

### 3.7 Biodiversity gains vs. ecosystem multifunctionality

**German landscape seed-enrichment (Freitag et al. 2023)**  
• +9 spp (+35 %) on 4 m² plots after four years, but only 1–2 of 12 measured functions (mainly N cycling) changed.  
→ Calcareous systems may reach functional redundancy quickly once dominants establish; management should target specific functions, not just species counts.

## 4. Synthesis: conceptual model

1. **Historical template** defines initial soil biota and seed bank.  
2. **Management regime** (cutting, grazing, fertilisation) rapidly modulates litter inputs → microbial C/N balance → plant recruitment microsites.  
3. **Soil microbial trajectory** splits along fungal- vs. bacterial-dominance.  Fungal-leaning states support higher forb richness; bacterial-leaning states promote grass dominance.  
4. **Priority effects** embed after 3–8 yrs, mediated by host-specific soil pathogens and altered nutrient stoichiometry.  
5. **Inoculation or nutrient stripping** can reset or accelerate phases but only if matched to host traits and run over multi-year windows.

## 5. Implications for practice

1. **Cut management outranks fine-tuning timing** – reinstate at least annual mowing in abandoned fens/grasslands before soil feedbacks harden (>3 yrs).  
2. **Avoid high FYM inputs** (>70 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) during restoration; they keep soils bacterial and slow forb return.  
3. **Use fungal-leaning soil inocula** (e.g. haystrewing from high-diversity cores) rather than generic compost.  
4. **Monitor >20 yrs** if experimenting with cut-timing or low-level grazing conversions; changes are slow and easily missed.  
5. **Inoculation trials** should (i) persist >150 days, (ii) use root-trait-matched hosts, (iii) test soil volumes ≥1 kg and (iv) consider local Glomeraceae dominance for strain selection.  
6. **Map historical grassland footprints (pre-1900)** to prioritise sites with intact legacy biota; they offer higher restoration ceiling.

## 6. Knowledge gaps & future directions

1. **Soil fauna** (enchytraeids, oribatid mites) remain under-quantified in calcareous systems; their interaction with AMF and root pathogens warrants mesocosm experiments.
2. **Tree-edge effects**: mechanistic work on how shading-induced litter quality alters microbial networks could refine buffer-width guidelines.  
3. **Functional redundancy threshold**: when does added species diversity translate into novel functions under varying drought/frost regimes?  Multi-functional response surfaces need construction.
4. **Genome-resolved metagenomics** across historical chronosequences to pinpoint which microbial lineages persist vs. re-assemble post-abandonment.
5. **Contrarian idea (speculative)**: applying **selective bacteriophages** to temporarily suppress rhizosphere bacteria might shift soils toward fungal dominance and open recruitment windows for forbs.  Proof-of-concept is lacking.
