# Weather in North Germany over the Last 100 Years

## Introduction

Over the past century, North Germany has experienced marked changes in its weather and climate patterns. Long‐term observational records point to a steady warming trend, evolving precipitation regimes, and increased frequency of weather extremes. Recent studies from the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) confirm that Germany’s mean temperature increased by approximately +1.7°C from 1881 to 2022 with an accelerated warming rate of 0.38°C per decade since 1971 compared to 0.12°C per decade over the entire period [1]. This report synthesizes observational studies, model projections, and urban climate analyses to provide a robust overview of historical and projected weather conditions in North Germany over the past 100 years.

## Historical Temperature Trends and Variability

Observational data from numerous meteorological stations in North Germany demonstrate that long-term temperature trends are characterized by a clear warming signal. Instrumental records document that after correcting for urban influences—as seen by merged records from metropolitan areas such as Berlin—temperature increases of around 1.04°C over the past century have been detected alongside reductions in frost days and increases in summer days [6]. In addition, data collected at Hamburg’s synoptic site indicate that urban heat island effects may further enhance local temperatures by as much as 1.1 K, while rural sites typically show lower increases [5]. Such trends are reflective of broader hemispheric warming patterns, although local microclimatic factors and land‐use changes also play critical roles.

Numerous studies have highlighted that the warming trend in North Germany is not linear; rather, observations suggest a strong acceleration in recent decades. For instance, historical DWD records emphasize that from 1881 through 2022 the temperature increase of +1.7°C is dominated by the recent acceleration with an increment of 0.38°C per decade since 1971 [1]. Such accelerated warming is indicative of both natural climate variability and anthropogenic impacts. Supplementary records from experimental field stations—such as the one in Bad Lauchstädt—provide additional support for these findings by extending the observational record through the integration of handwritten data, DWD archives, and more recent digitalized measurements [7].

## Precipitation Patterns and Extreme Events

Parallel to the warming trend, precipitation records in North Germany over the past century exhibit subtle yet significant changes in both magnitude and frequency. Analyses of data from Bavarian weather stations, which are not far from the northern margins of the region, have documented increases in annual precipitation. A study at Hohenpeißenberg recorded a maximum daily precipitation of 138.5 mm during an extreme event in 1999 [2]. In urban centers like Hamburg, long‐term records indicate that annual precipitation increased by approximately 0.8 mm per year overall—with even higher rates during the mid‐20th century periods [5]. These alterations in precipitation regimes are critical for water resource management and have implications for extreme events such as floods.

Moreover, extreme weather episodes, including heavy rainfall events and winter warming phenomena, have become more frequent. The integration of high-resolution observational networks and modern quality control techniques has allowed for the documentation of winter warming events, particularly using long-term datasets from field stations. Such synthesized datasets help in quantifying the probability of occurrence of extremes, which is essential for both risk assessment and adaptation planning [7].

## Urbanization Effects and Microclimate Variability

Urbanization in North Germany has played a significant role in modifying local weather patterns and intensifying the urban heat island (UHI) effect. City centers such as Hamburg and Berlin exhibit distinct temperature regimes compared to their rural surroundings. For instance, observational studies from Hamburg’s synoptic site reveal that inner‐city areas can record temperatures up to 1.1 K higher than suburban locations [5]. In Berlin, even after applying homogenization techniques to correct for urbanization, the merged instrumental records indicate an increase of 1.04°C over the last 100 years along with substantially modified diurnal temperature ranges [6].

The role of urban morphology—characterized by factors such as building density, surface imperviousness, and vegetation cover—in modulating these effects has been increasingly recognized. Studies using high-frequency urban networks demonstrate that even slight changes in land use can considerably influence local microclimates. For example, the FU Microclimate network at Freie Universität Berlin has provided 5‑minute interval measurements that reveal the heterogeneity of temperature and humidity across an urban landscape [6, 5]. These measurements underscore the importance of spatial resolution in assessing local climatic impacts and the need for targeted adaptation strategies.

## Model Projections and Future Climate Scenarios

Regional climate models have been applied to further understand future changes in the weather of North Germany. Multi-model ensemble simulations for Aachen under the IPCC A1B scenario project additional warming of between 1–2 K by mid-century and 3–4 K by 2100, with corresponding decreases in summer precipitation by approximately 17% [3]. These projections are consistent with the observed trends in the recent historical record and imply that both temperature and humidity extremes are expected to intensify.

Furthermore, the integration of downscaling techniques with coarse-resolution Global Climate Models (GCMs) using regional models such as COSMO-CLM and REMO has enhanced our ability to capture local scale weather phenomena in complex terrains. Such approaches have been crucial for assessing impacts in areas such as the North German Plain and coastal regions, where dynamic interactions with the North Sea modulate weather extremes [3].

## Data Collection, Integration, and Methodologies

Reliable data underpins climatic research. The observational records used to document North German weather trends are primarily sourced from the Deutscher Wetterdienst as well as complementary field stations such as the one in Bad Lauchstädt. Innovative methods have been developed to digitize historical handwritten logs, extend instrumental records, and bridge gaps in data coverage [7].

Quality-controlled datasets and homogenized records have allowed researchers to detect subtle shifts in climate variables even over a period as long as 100 years. Besides traditional observations, modern micrometeorological networks have provided high temporal resolution data that are crucial for capturing diurnal variations and extreme events at the urban scale [6]. Moreover, advanced statistical techniques and bias correction methodologies have been applied to historical series to remove non-climatic inhomogeneities, ensuring that trends are robust and attributable to genuine climatic changes [7].

The integration of these diverse data sources—from national archives to modern sensor networks—has allowed for the synthesis of comprehensive climatic datasets that support both retrospective reconstructions and forward-looking climate projections. This integrated approach is pivotal for building climate services that inform urban planning and policy formulation.

## Implications for Policy and Adaptation

The observed climate trends in North Germany have profound policy implications. Rising temperatures, altered precipitation regimes, and intensified extreme events pose challenges for urban infrastructure, agriculture, and water resource management. Detailed climate records provide essential baseline data for developing adaptive measures. Urban planners are increasingly incorporating climate adaptation strategies such as green infrastructure to mitigate UHI effects and bolster resilience against extreme precipitation and flooding events [6].

Moreover, the synthesis of observational and model-based evidence supports a shift toward consensus-based risk management within public policy. Integrated studies underscore the need for enhanced monitoring, improved forecasting, and efficient dissemination of climate information to stakeholders, ranging from municipal governments to the general public. Data-driven adaptation policies are now steering initiatives such as improved urban heat mitigation, flood risk mapping, and energy system planning [5, 6].

Furthermore, the valuable lessons learned from high-resolution regional climate simulations have informed both researchers and policy makers about the magnitude of future changes and the potential benefits of preemptive adaptation measures. With the projected additional warming and changes in precipitation patterns [3], a coordinated approach to climate governance across different administrative levels is essential for effective adaptation planning.

## Conclusion

The last 100 years of weather in North Germany illustrate a clear trend toward warming accompanied by subtle yet significant changes in precipitation and extreme events. Instrumental records reveal a mean temperature increase of approximately 1.7°C along with accelerated warming over recent decades, while historical and modern datasets document evolving precipitation patterns and urban heat island intensities. In tandem with robust model projections, these trends underscore the need for adaptive urban planning and informed policy decisions to mitigate and manage future climate risks. Continued enhancement of data collection, integration of diverse sources, and application of downscaling techniques will be essential to support effective climate resilience in North Germany [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
