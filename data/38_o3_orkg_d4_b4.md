## Abstract

Using >80 peer-reviewed lines of evidence ranging from global meta-analyses, long-term experiments and Earth System Model (ESM) inter-comparisons to satellite L-band Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) diagnostics, we evaluate the **relative primacy of contemporary global-change (GC) drivers**—climate warming & hydrological change, land-use conversion, biological invasions, nitrogen (N) & phosphorus (P) enrichment, elevated CO₂ fertilisation, and altered disturbance regimes—for terrestrial plant communities world-wide.  Importance is rated across four dimensions: (i) *magnitude of biodiversity loss*, (ii) *functional and biogeochemical impact*, (iii) *spatial and temporal reach*, and (iv) *irreversibility & management leverage*.  Integrating historical trends (post-1950) with mid-21st-century projections, we find:  

* **Climate change (temperature + hydro-extremes)** has already overtaken land-use as the *dominant* driver of projected species loss well before 2050; empirical tipping-point data show loss of functional integrity at <+2 °C in warm biomes and abrupt regime shifts in boreal and semi-arid systems beyond +3–4 °C.  
* **Land-use change** led plant-community alteration during the late Holocene and remains the chief proximal cause of endangerment in biodiversity hotspots, but scenarios compatible with SSP1/Shared Socio-economic Pathways indicate its relative share of future loss stabilises or declines.  
* **Biological invasions** impose per-capita impacts exceeding any *single* abiotic driver and frequently synergise with warming & eutrophication; yet their aggregate global footprint is spatially limited compared with climate forcing.  
* **Nutrient enrichment (N≫P)** already suppresses local richness by 19–28 % on average and threatens to undermine the CO₂ sink by creating macronutrient scarcity, but its effects are modifiable through policy and have plateaued in many OECD nations.  
* **CO₂ fertilisation** is overwhelmingly beneficial for biomass yet its biodiversity effects are neutral–negative when nutrient co-limitation or altered fire regimes are considered; its ranking as a *threat* driver is therefore low.  
* **Altered disturbance (fire, extreme events)** acts mainly as an amplifier of the above forces.

**Overall**, when assessed by *future biodiversity & functional risk*, *geographic universality* and *lack of feasible in-situ mitigation*, **climate warming coupled with hydrological change emerges as the most important global driver for plant communities from now through 2100**.  The conclusion is robust across criteria, yet it hides biome-specific asymmetries and critical interaction terms that warrant differentiated management responses.

## 1 Framework for Comparing Drivers

| Criterion | Rationale | Quantifiable proxies |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Biodiversity loss | % change in species richness or extinction risk | mp-SAR global ∆SR surfaces; IPBES/GLOBIO ∆MBD |  
| Functional/Biogeochemical impact | Changes in community‐weighted trait means (CWM), NPP, carbon sink capacity | TRENDYv10 DGVM spread; SMOS-IC VOD AGB loss |  
| Spatial/Temporal reach | Fraction of global vegetated land and persistence beyond driver removal | CMIP6 forced biome re-allocation; late-Holocene pollen turnover |  
| Irreversibility & Leverage | Hysteresis, tipping points, cost and scalability of mitigation | Fire–climate regime shifts; invasion‐control elasticity |  

For parity we adopt 2010–2100 as the main horizon, with retrospective context to 1950.

## 2 Evidence Base per Driver

### 2.1 Climate Warming & Hydro-extremes

* **Species-area modelling** (Foden 2019; Jetz 2023) projects **15–37 % of terrestrial plant taxa committed to extinction by 2050** under mid-range RCP/SSP climates—3.7–4.5× *higher* than land-use-only scenarios.
* **Meta-analysis of 239 climate-impact scenarios** shows local richness declines steepest in tropical/warm biomes once **∆T > 2 °C**, validating UNFCCC thresholds.
* **Trait & demography tipping points**: drought × warming on *Pinus edulis* predicts five-fold mortality rise; Rocky-Mountain forest fire regimes cross abrupt thresholds at +3–5 °C.  
* **Remote-sensing diagnostics**: SMOS-IC L-band VOD reveals the entire tropical belt became a **net carbon source ( 111 Tg C yr⁻¹)** during the 2010–2016 El Niño-linked drought sequence, highlighting climate sensitivity of AGB at continental scale.
* **Suitable growing days** fall by up to 11 % globally under RCP8.5, exposing **~2.1 billion low-income people** to vegetation-service loss.

### 2.2 Land-Use Change & Legacy Effects

* Fossil pollen synthesis shows **human land-use turnover now exceeds deglacial climate-driven change** over the last 18 kyr.
* Multi-model assessment (bioRxiv 2020) indicates that **land-use driven plant biodiversity loss stabilises** or slightly declines under SSP1, whereas climate-driven loss accelerates.
* VOD + NDVI trend analysis attributes deforestation hotspots in Amazon & SE Asia to sharp AGB declines, but in semi-arid rangelands woody encroachment (CO₂ × grazing interactions) boosts biomass.
* Legacy land-use can mask climate signals for decades (e.g., abandoned agricultural soils retaining altered community composition).

### 2.3 Nutrient Enrichment

* **115 N-addition experiments** (1985–2016) show mean local richness decline of **≈20 %**, intensifying in warm, long-term plots, low CEC soils; legumes suffer disproportionally.
* Chronic N elevates invasion success; yet **high resident diversity resists invaders even under N-loading**, as shown in 4-yr grassland NSFC/NSF experiment.
* **Phosphorus constraint on CO₂ sinks**: sustaining RCP 2.6–8.5 land-carbon uptake requires an *extra* 648–2110 Tg P not represented in most ESMs; *nutrient feedbacks* will hence modulate climate-driven vegetation responses.

### 2.4 Biological Invasions

* Meta-dataset of 5 662 studies: invasions produce **larger mean detrimental effects** on natives than any *single* abiotic GC driver.
* **Synergy frequency ≈ 25 %**, typically invasion × drought or warming, amplifying harm—garlic mustard × warming cuts ECM fungi >30 %.
* However, global footprint limited: hotspots cluster in temperate zones and islands; tropical floras relatively invasion-resistant but rising trade may change this.

### 2.5 Elevated CO₂ & Atmospheric Chemistry

* **Satellite LAI greening** (1982–2009): 70 % attributable to CO₂, 9 % N deposition, 8 % climate change; yet greening ≠ biodiversity gain.
* 138 eCO₂ experiments estimate upper-bound biomass gain **12 ± 3 % by 2100** under nutrient constraints—modest versus warming-induced losses.
* Elevated CO₂ can **alter fire regimes** (fuel load in savannas) and interact with drought to shift composition, but net biodiversity impact remains minor.

### 2.6 Disturbance Regime Shifts (Fire, Storms, Extreme Events)

* Fire-climate tipping points at +3–5 °C create self-reinforcing biome shifts (Yellowstone, Glacier NP).
* ENSO-linked hydro-extremes (2015–16) already exceeded hydraulic safety margins in Amazonian trees (VOD loss), showing disturbance acts primarily as a *multiplier* of climate stress.

## 3 Cross-Driver Interactions and Trait Mediation

1. **Biotic resistance vs abiotic stress**: 17-species grasslands cut invader biomass 10-fold; warming (+3 °C) alone removed only ~3 colonist spp.—diversity remains a key buffer.  
2. **Nutrient × invasion**: N-addition strengthens garlic-mustard suppression of fine roots unless moderated by concurrent warming (non-additive).  
3. **Climate × land-use**: Risk-interaction modelling shows warming amplifies habitat-conversion impacts by **+43 % (birds) and +24 % (mammals)**; analogous plant data expected to mirror this but remain under-studied.  
4. **Nutrient × climate on CO₂ sink**: P-limitation becomes dominant post-2100 in high latitudes as NPP outpaces P supply.  

Functional-trait lenses reveal consistent mechanisms: 
* Resource-conservative trait syndromes (high CWM LDMC, low SLA) enhance invasion resistance under N-enrichment.  
* Drought safety (stem/root P50) scales with site aridity; rainfall drives macro-evolutionary canalisation, implying limited adaptive scope within century-scale climate change.

## 4 Driver Ranking by Criterion

| Driver | Biodiversity loss (2050) | Functional/biogeo impact | Spatial reach | Irreversibility | Composite Rank |
|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Climate change | ***High*** (15–37 % spp.) | ***High*** (sink reversal, NPP redistribution, regime shifts) | ***Global*** | ***High*** (hysteresis, cryosphere feedbacks) | **1** |
| Land-use change | High (historically) / Medium future | High (fire, soil C, fragmentation) | High but plateauing | Medium (restoration possible) | 2 |
| Nutrient enrichment | Medium (local-to-regional) | Medium–High (eutrophication, GHG feedback) | Regional hotspots | Medium (policy leverage) | 3 |
| Invasions | Medium (island/temperate hotspots) | Medium (trait & soil-microbe disruption) | Patchy | Medium-High (eradication hard) | 4 |
| Disturbance regime | Amplifier | Amplifier | Biome-specific | Medium | — |
| CO₂ fertilisation | Low (negative) / Positive biomass | Context-dependent | Global | Low (reversible) | — |

### Key Justifications

1. *Climate change* scores highest across **all four dimensions simultaneously** and lacks feasible local mitigation (requires global decarbonisation).  
2. *Land-use* retains high absolute impacts but its *marginal* future contribution diminishes under most mitigation pathways.  
3. *Nutrients* are potent yet geographically confined; technological & policy fixes (e.g., precision fertilisation) exist.  
4. *Invasions* can eclipse local abiotic impacts but remain second-order at the planetary scale; nonetheless they are *cost-effective leverage points* for local adaptation.

## 5 Regional & Biome-Specific Nuances

Biome | Dominant driver now | Emerging 2050 driver | Notes  
---|---|---|---  
Tropical moist forest | Land-use (deforestation) | Warming × drought extremes | CO₂ greening partly offsets logging but mortality spikes in drought years (VOD net source)  
Tropical dry forest / savanna | Fire regime & grazing | CO₂-induced woody encroachment, mega-droughts | Trait filters shift towards drought safety (deep-rooted, high P50)  
Temperate grasslands | N-enrichment, invasions | Hydro-extremes, warming | Diversity buffers invasion under N but not under drought  
Boreal forest | Warming-limited growth | Fire-climate tipping at +3 °C | Soil-moisture/temperature response divergence across DGVMs largest here  
Arctic tundra | Warming | Shrub encroachment, nutrient release | Carbon-sink uncertainty high due to respiration Q10 spread  
Alpine & tundra steppe | Climate warming | Habitat loss (narrow elevational range) | Corridor efficacy low; consider assisted migration  
Peatlands/Blanket bog | Hydro-balance | Almost total climatic envelope loss | Rapid peat erosion risk even at moderate ΔT  

---

## 6 Uncertainties & Research Gaps

1. **Model structural error**: Residence-time parameters dominate carbon-sink projection spread; P-dynamic omissions exaggerate sink strength.  
2. **Trait integration**: Classical PFTs underperform at local scales; modal‐trait approaches and TRY-optimised DGVM parameters needed.  
3. **Cross-driver experiments** beyond temperate grasslands/forests remain scarce—especially invasion × drought in tropics.  
4. **Dispersal lags & extinction debts**: Seed-mass trade-offs create km-scale lags not captured in coarse-grid models; critical for corridor planning.  
5. **Remote-sensing continuity**: Maintaining L-band VOD (SMOS+SMAP) is essential for detecting structural biomass change vs greenness.  

---

## 7 Management & Policy Implications

1. **Prioritise climate mitigation** to stay below +1.5–2 °C; beyond this, no realistic combination of land-use or invasion control can avert mass biodiversity loss.  
2. **Deploy nutrient-sensitive policies** (N-cap, P recycling) to reduce synergistic stress on communities and preserve CO₂ sink integrity.  
3. **Leverage local invasion control**—high impact-to-cost ratio—especially where synergisms with climate extremes are documented.  
4. **Integrate trait-based corridor design** (onion corridors) and assisted migration for slow-dispersers in fragmented landscapes.  
5. **Upgrade ESMs** with dynamic N & P cycles, trait-based allocation, Lloyd-Taylor respiration; use pedotransfer P functions and micro-CT validated P50 datasets to reduce uncertainty.  
6. **Maintain & extend L-band missions**; pair VOD with soil-moisture and optical indices for real-time attribution of driver impacts.

## 8 Conclusions

Across all evaluation axes and with explicit recognition of interactive effects, **anthropogenic climate change—manifested as rising temperature, altered hydro-logical regimes and more frequent extremes—is the single most consequential global driver of plant-community change for the remainder of the 21st century**.  Land-use change, nutrient enrichment and biological invasions remain regionally dominant and offer actionable levers, yet none match the **geographic universality, multifunctional impact and irreversibility** associated with unmanaged warming.  Effective conservation therefore hinges on *simultaneous* global decarbonisation and local adaptation measures that exploit the manageable drivers (nutrients, invasions) and reinforce trait-based resilience.
