# Final Report: Multilingual Prompting with Transliterated Inputs Improves Tokenization Rates and Few-shot Performance

## Abstract

This report examines the integration of transliteration into multilingual prompting systems with a focus on optimizing tokenization rates and few-shot learning performance. Drawing upon a breadth of prior research, we outline how transliteration not only standardizes challenging scripts but also refines tokenization strategies and enhances cross-lingual transfer. Our investigation encompasses various language pair scenarios, including high-resource languages (e.g., English–Chinese) and low-resource Indic and Dravidian languages, while integrating discrete improvements achieved using neural, statistical, and hybrid systems. Metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, chrF, n-best ranking accuracy, and measures of cross-lingual representation similarity serve as the quantitative backbone for evaluating these innovations. This comprehensive report synthesizes historical insights, empirical studies, and innovative transliteration methodologies to provide a robust framework for future research and practical applications in multilingual settings.

## 1. Introduction

Multilingual models face significant challenges when working with diverse scripts and orthographies. These challenges become even more pronounced in few-shot learning scenarios, where limited training data requires that every bit of linguistic insight be leveraged. The evolution of transliteration as a preprocessing tool has led to marked improvements in tokenization—a critical step that lays the groundwork for effective cross-lingual learning. This report synthesizes multiple lines of research exploring the role of transliteration in enhancing tokenization strategies, especially when applied to languages with diverse scripts, low-resource settings, or complex morphological structures. We review each learning instance to provide a comprehensive account of how transliteration is integrated with tokenization for improved multilingual performance.

## 2. Background and Motivation

Traditional multilingual natural language processing (NLP) systems often suffer from inconsistencies in tokenization due to orthographic and script diversity. Historically, approaches have attempted to mitigate these challenges by either customizing tokenizers for language pairs or applying post-hoc transliteration as a normalization step. The motivation behind transliterated inputs is twofold: (1) to standardize scripts by mapping diverse orthographic symbols to a universal representation (commonly Latin or IPA), and (2) to enhance lexical overlap and sentence similarity in few-shot learning contexts. This leads to more robust cross-lingual representations and improved performance metrics across various tasks.

## 3. Detailed Review of Research Learnings

### 3.1 Impact of Tokenizer Design and Fine-Grained Language Pairing

Research on cross-lingual transfer has underscored the importance of carefully designed tokenizers. Studies indicate that, for certain language pairs, the specific customization of tokenization strategies—tailored to their unique linguistic characteristics—can be more impactful than superficial factors like shared script or linguistic proximity. Through the integration of transliteration, standardized input forms can be achieved, reducing the variability that complicates token boundary detection. This finding has particular implications in few-shot learning scenarios, where every token contributes to the model’s ability to generalize across languages.

### 3.2 Historical Perspective: NEWS Shared Tasks (2009–2011)

Historical evidence from shared tasks conducted between 2009 and 2011 reinforces the value of transliteration in cross-lingual contexts. The NEWS Shared Tasks provided early empirical support, showing that systems employing transliteration improved performance on n-best ranking tasks. Notably, in English–Chinese evaluation scenarios, systems achieved a peak top-1 accuracy of 0.320 using a multi-to-multi joint source-channel model. The reported 20% performance improvement illustrates that even early statistical machine translation frameworks benefited significantly from incorporating transliterated inputs, serving as a precursor to modern neural methods.

### 3.3 Unified Script Transcription in Under-Resourced Languages

Unified script transcription, particularly the conversion of native scripts to Latin or IPA, has been pivotal in bridging the script divergence seen in under-resourced languages. Research focusing on the Dravidian language family shows enhanced translation quality using methods such as the longest common subsequence for detecting cognate similarities. When evaluated through BLEU, METEOR, and chrF scores, unified transliteration strategies have yielded concrete improvements in translation outputs, with metrics suggesting higher lexical overlap and better grammatical alignment.

### 3.4 Tokenization and Few-Shot Learning Synergies

In multilingual few-shot scenarios, refined tokenization has emerged as a critical element. Integrated approaches that combine language pair-specific tokenization with transliteration techniques facilitate notable enhancements in cross-language transfer. Although explicit numerical gains on n-best ranking metrics are not always provided, the underlying principle holds: effective tokenization underpins the success of few-shot learning by improving the structural consistency of language inputs. For example, studies in English–Chinese settings indicate that robust preprocessing—including transliteration—can lead to measurable improvements both in ranking quality and overall task performance.

### 3.5 Evidence from Indic Languages

Empirical studies involving Indic languages, leveraging benchmarks such as IndicGLUE and the FLORES-101 dataset, demonstrate that transliterating scripts to a common form markedly enhances cross-lingual representations. The standardized form increases lexical overlap, which in turn improves sentence similarity and overall model performance. Statistical validations through centered kernel alignment methods and tests such as the Mann–Whitney U test have confirmed the significance of these improvements. These experiments provide robust evidence that transliteration, when integrated with thoughtful tokenization, is particularly beneficial for low-resource languages.

### 3.6 Integration within Statistical and Neural Frameworks

Methodically, the integration of transliteration into both statistical and neural architectures has yielded measurable performance boosts. Reports indicate improvements ranging from a 0.23–0.75 BLEU point increase across seven language pairs to a 20% jump in accuracy in English–Chinese tasks. Neural transliteration systems, particularly those based on sequence-to-sequence architectures and transformers, have obtained state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on tasks for languages such as Hindi (BLEU of 0.97) and Punjabi (BLEU of 0.88). These results underscore the transformative role of merging transliteration with language-specific tokenization strategies.

### 3.7 Advanced Tokenization Approaches: Unsupervised and Bayesian Methods

For languages with complex orthographies, such as Chinese, Korean, and Hungarian, unsupervised and Bayesian tokenization approaches have demonstrated considerable potential. By exploiting parallel corpus information, these methods dynamically refine token boundaries and better capture morphological nuances. The enhanced performance in low-resource settings is attributable to the model’s ability to adjust tokenization based on linguistic context—a feature that, when combined with transliteration, offers an adaptable solution for challenging scripts.

### 3.8 Comparative Analysis of Transliteration Methodologies

The comparative analysis of various transliteration techniques—including grapheme-based, phoneme-based, hybrid, and correspondence-based approaches—reveals that a multi-engine, complementary transliteration system yields superior outcomes. Each individual approach has its merits, but by combining them, the unique challenges posed by script diversity can be effectively mitigated. Empirical evaluations indicate that such integrated systems lead to improved tokenization metrics, which are crucial in both general multilingual prompting and few-shot learning contexts.

## 4. Implications for Multilingual Few-shot Learning

The cumulative evidence from the prior research highlights several key implications for multilingual few-shot learning:

1. Standardizing Inputs: Transliteration serves as a critical preprocessing step that minimizes the variability introduced by diverse scripts, directly increasing the tokenization efficacy and consistency of multilingual models.

2. Enhanced Cross-lingual Representations: The unification of scripts—especially for low-resource languages—leads to significantly improved cross-lingual alignment. This is observed not only in translation metrics (BLEU, METEOR, chrF) but also in the specialized metrics for few-shot learning.

3. Customization of Tokenizers: Tailoring tokenization strategies to specific language pairs, especially when combined with transliteration, significantly improves both tokenization rates and downstream performance metrics. This customized approach appears to have a greater impact than using generic or one-size-fits-all tokenizers.

4. Scalability Across Frameworks: The benefits of transliteration integrate effectively with both statistical machine translation and modern neural architectures—demonstrating its applicability across a range of computational frameworks and language complexities.

## 5. Future Directions and Unexplored Avenues

While the current body of research provides compelling evidence for the efficacy of transliteration in enhancing tokenization and few-shot performance, several new directions are worth considering:

- Multimodal Integration: Future work could explore integrating transliteration within multimodal frameworks where textual inputs are associated with other data types (images, audio), potentially synergizing transliteration with context-based adjustments in tokenization.

- Real-time Adaptation: Given the dynamic nature of language evolution, developing adaptive transliteration systems that continuously learn from evolving language use could further optimize tokenization rates in rapidly changing linguistic landscapes.

- Expanded Language Coverage: While substantial work has been done on Indic, Chinese, and European languages, further research on other under-represented languages (e.g., many African and indigenous languages) could validate and extend these findings.

- Integration with Reinforcement Learning: Employing reinforcement learning to adjust tokenization and transliteration jointly could offer a means to fine-tune models in a continuous feedback environment, thereby improving few-shot learning performance in a dynamic setting.

- Exploration of Hybrid Architectures: More in-depth analysis of hybrid models involving both neural and Bayesian methods could reveal new insights into optimizing tokenization strategies, particularly for languages with extremely complex morphological structures.

## 6. Conclusions

The integration of transliterated inputs in multilingual prompting offers a multi-dimensional benefit: it not only standardizes token representation across diverse scripts but also contributes to significant improvements in few-shot performance. By leveraging both historical insights and modern neural architectures, it is clear that refining tokenization using transliteration is far more than a preprocessing trick—it is a fundamental component that bridges linguistic diversity. The evidence, spanning robust statistical analyses and SOTA results in multiple language pairs, highlights the potential for broader applications and more adaptive systems in the near future. Advanced and complementary transliteration strategies, when coupled with customized tokenizers, pave the way for more inclusive and effective multilingual language models.

This comprehensive synthesis of historical and recent research provides a solid foundation for the continued evolution of multilingual processing systems, ensuring that both high- and low-resource languages can benefit from enhanced tokenization strategies and robust few-shot learning performances.
