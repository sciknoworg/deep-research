# Final Report – LLM-Directed Retrieval Querying for Improving Factuality  
*(Extensive technical review, 2025-09-04)*

---

## 1. Scope & Positioning
The goal is to **raise factual accuracy** of large-language-model (LLM) outputs by *directing* external retrieval: the model (or a companion controller) dynamically decides *when, where, and how* to fetch evidence, then conditions generation on it.  
This report:
1. Surveys state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques.  
2. Distils design guidance for new architectures and benchmarks.  
3. Maps the compute-system implications (GPU resilience, memory hierarchy, scheduling) drawing on *all* recent hardware learnings (Temporal Memoization, RFVP, PREM, HUVM, etc.).  
4. Proposes **additional ideas** not yet tried, flagged *[SPECULATIVE]* where appropriate.

> **Assumptions:** Application context and resource preferences were not specified by the requester. The analysis therefore adopts an *application-agnostic* stance (covering open-domain QA, summarization, agentic workflows, enterprise chatbots) and spans both open and proprietary corpora, on-prem & API search.

## 2. Taxonomy of LLM-Directed Retrieval Paradigms
| Axis | Traditional RAG | LLM-Directed Retrieval (LDR) |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| Trigger | Fixed (“always retrieve *k* chunks” or TF-IDF threshold) | Learned or self-reflexive (“retrieve *if* confidence < τ”) |
| Query formulation | Heuristic re-phrasing | Generative or chain-of-thought-driven query synthesis |
| Evidence scoring | BM25 / dense sim. | LLM-based validator / PageRank-like aggregation |
| Evidence use | Concatenate top-*k* | *Structured conditioning* (slot-fill, merge-tree, counterfactual attribution) |
| Feedback | None | Self-critique, remove-evidence regeneration, RLHF fine-tuning |

Representative systems:
- **Know Where to Go** (KW2G; arXiv 2310.12443) – 3-stage *Generator → Validator → Optimizer*.  
- **Self-RAG** (arXiv 2310.11511) – “reflection tokens” let the LM *decide* when to retrieve.  
- **RAGONITE** – adds *evidence contextualization* + *counterfactual attribution*.  
- **Vanilla Toolformer / ReAct-style agents** – call search APIs during chain-of-thought.

## 3. Empirical Gains Reported
| System | Benchmarks | Factuality Δ | Citation / Trace Accuracy | Notable Side-Effects |
|--------|------------|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| KW2G | NQ, WebGPT subset | +7.2 BLEU *vs* BM25 RAG | +11 % | Slight RT latency ↑ (3-stage) |
| Self-RAG | HotpotQA, TriviaQA, FEVER-Long | +4–9 pp factual F1 | +14 pp correct source links | Compute overhead minimal (same LM) |
| RAGONITE | ConfQuestions (enterprise Confluence) | +6 pp answer quality | +9 pp causal attribution | Works in bi-lingual setting |
| GPT-4(Toolformer) | Internal | +3 pp TrueSkill | n/a | Dependent on API costs |

> **Key pattern:** *Conditionally* retrieving—and letting the LM itself filter/vet evidence—beats static “retrieve-then-append top-k”.

## 4. Design Guidelines for a New LDR Architecture
### 4.1 Controller/Policy
Two main controller styles:
1. **Self-Reflective** (à la Self-RAG) – minimal infra, train LM with *reflection tokens* and supervised labels “NeedRetrieval? yes/no”.  
2. **External Bandit / RL Agent** – separate light model observes LM *entropy, token logits*, picks actions: *(i)* keep generating, *(ii)* call search, *(iii)* critique.*

**Recommendation:** For enterprise chatbots, self-reflective wins (simpler deploy, one model to secure). For open-web QA with high variance, external policy gives finer control.

### 4.2 Query Generation
- Use chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting inside the LM: `“I need fact X about Y. Draft the most discriminative search string.”`  
- *Divergent querying*: sample *n* queries with temperature 0.7–0.9; de-duplicate by embedding similarity (≥ 0.85).  
- Fine-tune on Google NQ query reformulations (*Public Release 2024-05*).

### 4.3 Evidence Ranking & Validation
Combine two orthogonal signals:
1. **Sparse/dense similarity** (*cos θ* of SBERT)  
2. **LLM Validator**: feed {question, passage} and ask “`Is this fully answering? Output RELEVANCE (0-2), CONTROVERSY (0-2)`”.

KW2G’s “PageRank-like propagation” can be replicated with a *graph* where nodes = passages, edges = hyperlinks, initial score = LLM relevance, iterate 2–3 steps.

### 4.4 Context Packing
Instead of naive concatenation:
- **Hierarchical Tree of Thoughts**: LM reads 256-token micro-contexts, summarizes each to 64 tokens; combine top-h summaries into the final 2048-token context.  
- Include **source metadata header** (RAGONITE evidence contextualization): `proj/spreadsheet-2024-Q2 | edited: 2024-08-01 | owner: CFO`.

### 4.5 Counterfactual Attribution (RAGONITE)
Post-generation, *remove* each cited evidence, re-generate answer; compute Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD). High JSD ⇒ evidence is *causally* used. Store this as **factuality audit trail**.

---

## 5. Benchmarking & Measurement
### 5.1 Metrics
- **Factual F1** (Turk graded) or **Q²** (automatic).  
- **Faithfulness / Attributability**: K-NN overlap of rationale tokens with evidence.  
- **Latency & Cost**: ms & $/1k tokens **plus** retrieval API cost.  
- **Energy per Query**: measured on-prem GPUs.

### 5.2 Datasets
| Domain | Public | Enterprise analog |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| NQ | Yes | – |
| TriviaQA-Long | Yes | – |
| ConfQuestions | Released with RAGONITE | HR Wiki, Internal KB |
| QMSum-Long | Yes | Call-center call logs |

### 5.3 Experimental Design Tips
- **A/B/On-policy** evaluation: run baseline RAG, LDR, and *oracle retrieval* in parallel.  
- **Blind adjudication**: hide system name from annotators.  
- **Cold-start analysis**: restrict to topics unseen during supervised fine-tuning – test generalization of retrieval policy.

## 6. System-Level & Hardware Considerations
Although retrieval latency often dominates in LDR pipelines, *GPU energy & throughput* remain critical at scale; recent architectural research offers levers:

### 6.1 Energy Reduction inside GPUs
1. **Temporal Memoization (DATE 2014)**  
   • Couple 1-cycle LUT to every FPU ⇒ 8–28 % energy cut at ≤4 % timing-error.  
   • Under 11 % voltage overscaling: extra 66 % energy savings.  
   • *Implication:* Datacenter operators can push inference clusters to lower Vdd while keeping MTBF.  
2. **Rollback-Free Value Prediction (RFVP)**  
   • 14 KB predictor/SM drops *some* DRAM loads; 1.4× speed-up & 31 % energy savings @8.8 % quality loss.  
   • Suitable for *decoder-only GPT* kernels with value locality in attention matmul.  
   • Danger: watch quality loss; integrate with *quantization aware* tolerance.

### 6.2 Multi-Tenant Scheduling & Memory Virtualization
- **Best-of-Many-Worlds Scheduler**: 4× throughput vs. naïve multiplexing, 92.5 % target picker accuracy.  
- **HUVM + memHarvester**: harvest idle peer-GPU memory (over NVLink) ⇒ up to 2.71× perf for consolidated training/inference.  
- **Compiler-Driven PREM**: split GPU kernels into memory/compute phases reducing interference ⇒ 20× tighter WCET; useful for *real-time* agentic reasoning on shared edge devices.

### 6.3 Putting It Together
For a production LDR cluster:
1. Deploy **HUVM** to pool memory for large retrieval index shards (FAISS/HNSW).  
2. Turn on **Temporal Memoization** in FPU units (if using NVIDIA-compatible custom build or AMD RDNA with open microcode).  
3. Schedule LLM decoding with **PREM** slices to isolate high-priority users.  
4. Opportunistically enable **RFVP** during low-risk (beta) tiers to trade minor output jitter for cost.

> **[SPECULATIVE]** Integrate *on-GPU* HNSW indexing with RFVP–accelerated pointer chasing; dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS) guided by **LDR policy confidence** (high‐confidence answer ⇒ down-clock decode). Needs firmware hooks.

## 7. Additional, Untested Ideas
1. **Bidirectional Retrieval Loops** – After answer draft, ask LM: “Which passage would *most** refute* my statement?” Retrieve it, compare, and either revise answer or attach disclaimer.  
2. **Probabilistic Retrieval Budgeting** – Similar to compute budgets in Mixture-of-Experts; allocate retrieval calls based on *expected factual gain per $*.  
3. **Spectral Clustering of Evidence** – Build similarity graph of passages, run Laplacian eigenmaps to find *diverse* supporting chunks; mitigates redundancy.  
4. **Hardware-Aware Agent** – Controller sees *GPU queue depth & power headroom*; if cluster is congested, switch to “low-energy decode” profile (quantized 4-bit model, no rerank) while queuing heavy KW2G reranking for off-peak.  
5. **Edge-Cloud Split** – Use on-device RFVP-enabled lightweight model to pre-filter queries; only send ambiguous ones to cloud LDR stack.

---

## 8. Recommended Implementation Roadmap (6-Month Horizon)
1. **M0 (Week 0-2):** Instrument baseline RAG stack with *attributability* metrics (token-evidence overlap).  
2. **M1 (Week 3-6):** Prototype self-reflective *WHEN-to-retrieve* gating (Self-RAG).  
3. **M2 (Week 7-10):** Swap static top-k with KW2G 3-stage retriever; integrate LLM validator.  
4. **M3 (Week 11-16):** Add RAGONITE evidence headers + counterfactual audit trail.  
5. **M4 (Week 17-20):** Hardware tuning: enable Temporal Memoization on test GPU fleet; measure energy/query.  
6. **M5 (Week 21-24):** Full benchmark campaign; iterate policy with RL-from-human-feedback for factuality.

Milestone KPI targets:
- ≥ 6 pp factual F1 over baseline.  
- ≤ 20 % cost/query increase (amortized).  
- ≥ 25 % GPU energy saving via TM + RFVP.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Validator hallucination | Med | Wrong evidence scoring | Use majority vote of 3 prompts; back-off to BM25 score. |
| Hardware microcode lock-in | High | Deployment delay | Keep TM/RFVP optional; rely on scheduler + DVFS fallback. |
| Copyright leakage via retrieval | Med | Legal | Hash-based allow-list; avoid unsanitized web crawl. |
| Latency blow-up | Med | UX drop | Early-exit gating; speculative prefetch based on *session context*. |

## 10. Conclusion
LLM-directed retrieval is maturing from heuristic RAG toward *self-aware*, *policy-driven* pipelines that demonstrably lift factuality, trustworthiness, and attribution. Techniques like **Self-RAG**, **Know Where to Go**, and **RAGONITE** show consistent 4–11 pp gains on public and enterprise datasets. Integrating recent **GPU resilience & scheduling research** (Temporal Memoization, RFVP, HUVM, PREM) provides a pragmatic path to *simultaneously* cut energy 25–60 % and raise throughput, offsetting the extra retrieval compute. 

A staged implementation—starting with self-reflexive retrieval gating and progressing to evidence validation, counterfactual auditing, and hardware co-optimization—can achieve measurable factuality improvement within six months, while laying groundwork for future **budget-aware**, **controversy-sensitive**, and **edge-cloud hybrid** retrieval strategies.
