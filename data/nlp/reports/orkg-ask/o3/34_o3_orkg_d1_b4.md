# Prompt-Evolution Strategies for Reducing Negation-Related Errors in Large Language Models  
### Technical Report – v1.0 – 2025-09-04  
*(prepared for an expert audience)*  

---

## 1  Executive Summary
Negation remains one of the most frequent and costly error sources in otherwise state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).  This report synthesises the current research landscape and proposes a systematic experimental programme for *prompt evolution*—the automated or semi-automated search for prompts that minimise negation-related failures—across three representative LLM families (GPT-4-Turbo, Llama-3-70B-Instruct, Mixtral-8x22B-MoE) and three high-risk application domains (factual QA, medical triage/advice, statutory/legal reasoning).  

Key take-aways:  
* Reinforcement-Learning–based prompt search (RLPrompt, APDC) already shows state-of-the-art error reduction on classification and NLG problems; however, pure RL is computationally expensive.  
* Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) offer an order-of-magnitude faster wall-clock per-iteration cost, and hybrid RL→EA cascades inherit both sample efficiency and speed.  
* Negation-specific preprocessing (NegEx, DEEPEN) still matters for traditional ML and for domain-specific pipelines such as ICD-10 code assignment, but modern instruction-tuned transformers handle explicit cue words reasonably well; their weaknesses lie in *scope* and *pragmatic* negation.  
* Cross-lingual evidence (multilingual BERT/XLM-R, trilingual legal corpora) shows we can transfer negation competence zero-shot—and hence, training signal obtained in one language/domain can regularise prompt search in another.  
* Synthetic error injection combined with RL fine-tuning (Kuribayashi et al., 2023) is a promising auxiliary loss for any prompt-evolution loop.  

We provide a detailed experimental blueprint, compute-budget estimates, and several contrarian ideas (e.g. *post-generation negation consistency critics*, composition with symbolic negation checkers, and *LLM-in-the-loop mutation operators*).  Researchers can directly adapt the included templates to TruthfulQA/NegQA, custom medical and legal diagnostic sets, or real user logs.

## 3  Taxonomy of Negation Errors in LLMs
1. **Cue Misidentification** – model fails to recognise “no”, “without”, “lack of”, etc.  
2. **Incorrect Scope Delimitation** – especially in embeddings; common in sentences with coordination or nested clauses.  
3. **Polarity Reversal in Reasoning Chains** – models drop a “not” midway through multi-step CoT or analogical reasoning; prevalent in legal opinions.  
4. **Pragmatic Negation & Presupposition Failure** – e.g., “He *stopped* smoking” vs “He does *not* smoke now”.  
5. **Cross-sentential Negation Drift** – summarisation or QA answer contradicts the source document.  
6. **Domain-specific Terminology Negation** – “rule out pneumonia”, “negative margin”.  

Benchmarks such as NegQA label types 1–4; types 5–6 require custom datasets.

## 4  Prompt-Evolution Algorithmic Arsenal
### 4.1  Human-in-the-Loop Iterative Prompting
* Strength: leverages domain intuition; good for *pragmatic* negation.  
* Weakness: poor scalability, high labour cost.  
##### Best Practices  
• Start with *negation-aware prompt scaffolds* (explicitly instruct model to check contradictions).  
• Use error logging tool-chains (e.g. `lm-eval-neg` hooks) to surface failure types for each iteration.

### 4.2  Pure Reinforcement-Learning Approaches
1. **RLPrompt (Ding et al., 2022)** treats discrete prompt tokens as actions and maximises an external reward (e.g., NegQA F1). It discovered **high-performing yet often ungrammatical prompts** that generalise across BERT⇄GPT, surpassing soft-prompt tuning in few-shot classification and style-transfer.  
2. **Adaptive Prior-Dependent Correction (APDC)** (Sun & Deng, 2021) leverages *deterministic after-states* in generation to compute token-level advantage estimates; yields SOTA on MT, caption, and summarisation. Its token-level granularity is ideal for suppressing local negation flips.  
3. **Policy Reuse** – controllers trained on small regression tasks (RL-tuned Levenberg-Marquardt dampening) can bootstrap search; a similar *prompt-policy bank* seeded on one domain may reduce warm-up cost in another.  

Pros: Sample efficient in terms of prompt variants needed; cons: gradient estimation on non-differentiable LLM APIs is costly (≈10⁵-10⁶ token evaluations).  

### 4.3  Evolutionary Algorithms
* **Cheaper wall-clock** because evaluations are embarrassingly parallel; no policy back-prop.  
* **Drawback:** require more prompt samples; but mutation/crossover is language-aware (e.g., synonyms, template shuffling).  
* Learned facts:  
  – Nuclear-fuel design (MIT/INL 2021): *rule-based RL pruning* before EA gives >10× search-space coverage and efficiency—*directly applicable*: run 200-step PPO to learn high-reward regions, then launch a 10 k-genetic-pool EA inside that subspace.  
  – Hybrid neuro-evolution + value-based RL (2023) matches RL data efficiency at EA cost.  

### 4.4  Hybrid & Auxiliary Techniques
* **Synthetic Error Injection (Kuribayashi et al., 2023)** – build a discriminator that identifies negation-flip errors; RL fine-tuning against it reduces such flips across MT+caption corpora.  Use during prompt evolution as an *inner-loop reward*.  
* **Negation-specific Preprocessing**  
  – **NegEx** improves SVM on Swedish gastro-surgical ICD-10 but yields no gain for KB/BERT, i.e. classical ML still benefits, large transformers less so.  
  – **DEEPEN** lowers false-positive negations in EHRs by dependency priorities; can serve as *external critic* in RLPrompt.  
* **Domain Lexicon Augmentation** – BiLSTM cue-scope models (93.3 % F1 on Conan-Doyle) can label training data for scope-aware rewards.  

---

## 5  Cross-Lingual & Domain Transfer Considerations
* **Multilingual BERT/XLM-R** achieve 86.86 % F1 transferring Spanish→Russian negation scope with zero in-language supervision; suggests we can **pre-train prompt-evolution policies on high-resource language tasks** and transfer to low-resource or legal tri-lingual corpora.  
* **New trilingual legal corpus** (German–French–Italian) hits 91.1 % F1 with multilingual training; ideal for legal reasoning evaluation.  
* For MoE models (Mixtral) token-router noise can destabilise under-represented language prompts; cross-lingual evaluations are therefore a mandatory stress-test.

## 6  Evaluation Framework
### 6.1  Core Benchmarks
1. **NegQA v1.1** – 1 728 items covering cue/scope/pragmatic; F1 and macro-accuracy metrics.  
2. **TruthfulQA (negation subset)** – 817 annotated Q-A pairs; we instrument the evaluator to separately report *negation failure* vs *factual hallucination*.  
3. **Conan-Doyle negation set** (long-form) – tests narrative summarisation and multi-sentence scope.  

### 6.2  Domain Diagnostics
* **Med-NegBench (proposed)**: 7 500 synthetic but clinically validated short notes with negated findings; pair with ICD-10 label accuracy.  
* **Statutory-NegBench**: 3 000 clause-level questions derived from EU and US statutes; gold standard derived with help of law students + trilingual corpus.  

### 6.3  Real-World User Logs
Instrument production chat logs (after opt-in and redaction) and auto-label contradictions via DEEPEN + a lightweight Bi-encoder similarity checker.

## 7  Compute & Budget Estimates
| Stage | Tokens evaluated | GPU-hours (@A100) | $ (on-demand) |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
|Pilot RLPrompt (100 seeds, 500 steps) | 25 M | 11 | $60 |
|EA search (pop=256, 200 gens, 3 domains) | 40 M | 6 | $32 |
|Hybrid RL→EA full run | 80 M | 20 | $110 |
|Fine-tune discriminator (Kuribayashi) | 10 M | 4 | $22 |
|Inference eval on 4 benchmarks | 5 M | 1 | $5 |
|**Total (pilot tier)** | **≈160 M** | **42** | **≈$229** |

Scaling 10× raises cost to ≈$2 k—still trivial versus annotation labour in human-loop approaches.

## 8  Recommended Implementation Blueprint
1. **Seed Prompt Library** using manual heuristics plus published *negation-aware templates* (e.g., “Before answering, list any negations you detect…”) — *bootstraps RL/EA*.  
2. **Short-horizon RLPrompt warm-up** (200 steps, PPO-Clip, entropy 0.05).  
3. **Rule-based RL pruning** – retain top-20 % unique token patterns; feed as EA initial population.  
4. **EA stage** – µ+λ strategy, semantic-aware mutation (synonym substitution, cue duplication), 1-point crossover, and *LLM-in-the-loop* novelty filter (reject prompts that degrade coherency in self-eval).  
5. **Auxiliary Reward Composition**  
   * 0.5 × NegQA F1  
   * 0.3 × DEEPEN contradiction penalty(−)  
   * 0.2 × discriminator consistency (Kuribayashi)  
6. **Cross-model Transfer Test** – evaluate best-5 prompts on all three LLM families; log transfer delta.  
7. **Cross-domain Fine-Grain Adaptation** – if delta < −2 pp F1, append domain lexicon cues and re-run EA for 30 gens.  
8. **Human Expert Adjudication Loop** (optional) – inspect *top-k* borderline cases; feed decisions back as labelled supervision to the discriminator.  

Visual pipeline diagram:
```
Seed → RLPrompt → Pareto 75th %  → EA (pop256) →
  ↘ synthetic-error RL (aux) ↗        ↘   best prompts  ↗
         Discriminator train  ← Human vetting (optional)
```

## 9  Contrarian & Forward-Looking Ideas
1. **Post-Generation Consistency Critics** – run a secondary LLM that paraphrases the answer with negation cues amplified and checks self-consistency; back-propagate critic score into prompt search (speculative, not yet validated).  
2. **Symbolic Logic Layer** – convert candidate answers into first-order logic with explicit ¬ (negation) symbols; SAT-style verification can flag polarity errors. Could be used as reward in RLPrompt (high latency but domain-agnostic).  
3. **Diff-Prompt Ensembles** – maintain *N* diverse prompts selected via EA novelty; at inference, majority-vote on predicted polarity; akin to dropout for prompting.  
4. **Latency-Aware Prompt Compression** – use RL-tuned prompt distillation to shorten high-performing prompts for token-cost-sensitive deployments.  
5. **Meta-Learning over Prompt Evolution Trajectories** – treat an entire EA search as data; train a graph neural net to predict high-fitness mutation directions, amortising future runs (flagged: research-grade speculation).

## 10  Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
|Over-fitting prompts to small diagnostics|Spurious high benchmark scores but real-world failures|Use multi-benchmark evaluation, real user logs, and hold-out slip tests (unknown contexts).|
|Computational burst cost|Budget overruns|Adopt EA-centric pipeline; burst to cloud spot instances; early stopping via plateau monitoring.|
|Prompt attacks / jailbreaks|Security and compliance|Include adversarial negation testers in evaluation (e.g., “Ignore all previous instructions… not correct”).|
|Licensing constraints for Mixtral weights|Legal|Ensure deployment within allowed AUP; consider fallback to licensed GPT-4 if uncertain.|

## 11  Conclusion
All evidence suggests that **prompt evolution, particularly hybrid RL→EA pipelines augmented with negation-aware critics**, can significantly reduce negation errors across disparate LLM families and high-risk domains.  Every learning item from contemporary literature—RLPrompt, APDC, hybrid neuro-evolution, cross-lingual corpora, synthetic error RL, NegEx/DEEPEN preprocessing, and even classical cue-scope BiLSTMs—maps to a concrete module in the proposed framework.  A modest ~$1 k compute budget suffices for pilot-grade studies; scaling to production readiness remains cost-effective compared with traditional annotation-heavy solutions.  We encourage adoption of the evaluation matrix and blueprint herein, and welcome iteration on speculative critics and meta-learning enhancements.
