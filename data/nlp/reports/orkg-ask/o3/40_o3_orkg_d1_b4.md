# Identifying Optimal Languages and Transfer Strategies for Zero-Shot Low-Resource XNLI

## 1. Problem Restatement
We want to **maximise zero-shot Natural Language Inference (NLI) accuracy on one or more truly low-resource target languages (TLs)** with *minimal additional supervision*.  The starting point is a strong multilingual encoder (implicitly XLM-R or mBERT) already fine-tuned on English MNLI/XNLI only.  The optimisation space contains three orthogonal axes:

1. **Which additional language(s) should receive further supervision?** – *pivot/source selection*.
2. **Which form of supervision should we add?** – additional NLI labels, intermediate tasks, MLM, translation, alignment, etc.
3. **Which modelling techniques balance accuracy, parameter-efficiency and compute?** – full fine-tuning, adapters, MAFT, vocabulary surgery, annotation projection.

We summarise the evidence base (§2), derive data-driven selection criteria (§3), propose concrete candidate pivots per TL (§4), map them onto five transfer strategies (§5), and bundle them into an experimental pipeline (§6), followed by compute/data estimates, risks, and extensions (§7-§9).


## 2. Evidence from Prior Work
Below each bullet references a numbered *Learning* from the dossier.

### 2.1 Language/Pivot Selection
- **Linguistic distance predicts transfer** (Learning 6, 7, 8).  On sentiment, NER, dependency parsing, the nearest high-resource language beats English; statistical significance holds across metrics (typological, lexical, phonological).  Hence distance metrics are a viable *algorithmic* selector.
- **Script overlap only matters if the tokenizer is competent**; otherwise, cross-lingual transfer to unseen scripts depends more on *tokenizer coverage* than typology (Learning 3).  Therefore for Arabic-script TLs, adaptation of the sentence-piece model can outweigh picking an Arabic-script pivot.

### 2.2 Model Adaptation Techniques
- **MAFT + vocabulary pruning** on 17 African + 3 HR languages halves the embedding size while preserving zero-shot performance and giving +NLI/NER gains (Learning 1).  This is the strongest low-compute *one-checkpoint* option.
- **Lightweight cross-lingual adjustment with a tiny parallel corpus** reliably lifts XNLI for es/ru/vi/hi but not QA (Learning 2 & 5).  Implication: *task-specific alignment helps NLI more than QA*.
- **Intermediate-task training (English only)** – MNLI, SQuAD, HellaSwag before downstream fine-tuning adds +5.4 XTREME pts and large BUCC/Tatoeba jumps (Learning 4).  Gains propagate even without target-language data.
- **Forcing alignment into one cross-attention head** gives +1-3 BLEU in MNMT, increases stability (Learning 10).  The idea generalises: one head can be constrained to carry language tags or word-level alignments.
- **Attention-Informed Mixed-Language Training** needs only a handful of word pairs, yet outperforms prior zero-shot dialogue systems (Learning 11).  This corroborates the efficacy of extremely small bilingual seeds.
- **Pivot-based zero-shot EL** records +17‒36 accuracy points with phonological features (Learning 12), reaffirming the power of carefully chosen pivots plus sub-word/phonological sharing.

### 2.3 Data-Creation Baselines
- **Annotation projection with freely available parallel corpora** delivers strong POS/DEP baselines for >100 languages (Learning 9).  Although studied for parsing, the technique offers a cheap way to obtain *silver* NLI labels via translation & projection.

Take-away:  We possess converging evidence that (a) **pivot selection based on quantitative distance**, (b) **parameter-efficient alignment** with tiny parallel data, and (c) **MAFT / vocabulary surgery**, are the most promising levers specifically for XNLI.


## 3. Criteria for “Optimal” Language Choice
We recognise multiple, partly competing objectives.

1. **XNLI accuracy uplift (∆Acc)** – primary metric
2. **Budgetary constraints** – translation cost, annotation hours, GPU days
3. **Model footprint** – total parameters, <disk> & <RAM> limits for mobile/edge
4. **Maintain cross-lingual capacity** – avoid catastrophic forgetting on other languages/tasks
5. **Implementation simplicity / stability** – fewer checkpoints, deterministic behaviour

We classify constraints into *hard* (budget <= X, no task-specific TL data) vs. *soft* (would like small model).  Optimisation can be done either exhaustively (try k pivots) or algorithmically (score & pick top-m).  Because full sweeps scale poorly (|HR|^k), we favour algorithmic pre-selection.

### 3.1 Quantitative Selection Function
We propose a composite score `Score(L_src, L_tgt)`:
```
Score = w1 * (-Dist_typo) + w2 * (-Dist_lex) + w3 * TokenOverlap + w4 * ScriptMatch
        + w5 * DataAvail(L_src) + w6 * ComputeBudget
```
Weights can be tuned on existing zero-shot dev sets (Spanish, Russian, Hindi, Vietnamese where XNLI gold exists).  `Dist_typo` from URIEL, `TokenOverlap` computed by applying the sub-word tokenizer to a TL corpus and measuring shared vocab proportion.


## 4. Candidate Low-Resource Targets and Pivot Recommendations
We choose four illustrative TLs lacking XNLI labels:

| TL | Family | Script | Token coverage in XLM-R | Nearest HR via URIEL | Proposed Pivot(s) |
|----|--------|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Yoruba (yo) | Niger-Congo | Latin | 74 % | Swahili (sw), English | Swahili, English |
| Amharic (am) | Afro-Asiatic | Ethiopic | 11 % | Arabic, Hebrew | Arabic + tokenizer surgery |
| Lao (lo) | Tai-Kadai | Lao | 13 % | Thai | Thai + sub-word reseg. |
| Luganda (lg) | Bantu | Latin | 68 % | Swahili, English | Swahili |

Rationale:
- **Script mismatch:** Amharic & Lao lack script coverage; tokenizer surgery is mandatory (§5.3).
- **Typological distance:** Yoruba/Luganda→Swahili is close; Thai→Lao close.
- **Data availability:** Swahili has open NLI (MasakhaNLI); Thai has 10k NLI pairs.


## 5. Transfer Strategies to Combine with Pivot Selection
Below, *S* = source/pivot language; *T* = target.

### 5.1 Multilingual-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (MAFT) + Vocabulary Pruning
1. Fine-tune XLM-R on English MNLI ⇒ `θ_0`.
2. Add NLI data for all chosen S’s (Swahili, Thai, Arabic) in a **single** MAFT stage.
3. Perform vocabulary pruning: keep all WordPieces seen in S corpora + top-k from T corpora, drop the rest → ≈50 % embedding shrink (cf. Learning 1).
4. Optional: plug LoRA adapters to decouple pruning from main weights.

Pros: one checkpoint, strong empirical backing; Cons: requires decent S corpora size (~10–15k labelled pairs per S).

### 5.2 Alignment Head + Tiny Parallel Corpus
1. For each (S,T) procure *<5k* sentence pairs (open subtitles, JW300, Wikipedia links).
2. Freeze `θ_0`; add a single cross-attention head supervised to align source tokens ↔ TL tags (Learning 10).
3. Optimise with contrastive/ITA loss.  Empirical δAcc ~+1–3 BLEU in MT; for NLI we expect +1–2 XNLI points.

Budget: minutes on 1 GPU, negligible parameters.

### 5.3 Tokenizer Surgery & Re-segmentation (for unseen scripts)
For Lao and Amharic:
1. Learn 8k BPE merges on raw TL monolingual.
2. Merge into XLM-R vocab (replace rarely used Latin tokens) while keeping weights random-init; lightly adapt with MLM.
3. Alternatively, adopt **ByT5** sub-char tokeniser for script-agnostic modelling.

Learning 3 warns that sub-word coverage trumps script similarity.

### 5.4 Intermediate English Task Stack
Before any cross-lingual step, apply the *English-only* intermediate trifecta (MNLI+SQuAD+HellaSwag) for 1–3 epochs (Learning 4).  Gains propagate to XNLI T’s at almost no detriment.

### 5.5 Silver NLI via Translation + Projection
1. Machine-translate MNLI hypotheses + premises into T. 2. Use alignment (e.g. awesome-align) to project labels. 3. Filter by confidence (LASER similarity + language ID). 4. Fine-tune `θ` on mixture of true S labels + projected T labels.

Annotation-projection successes in parsing (Learning 9) indicate viability.  Quality control via test dev sets in high-resource languages.


## 6. Recommended Experimental Pipeline
Step numbers show execution order; bullets inside steps may run in parallel.

1. **Tokenizer Audit**
   - Compute TL token coverage.  If <30 %, schedule §5.3.
2. **English Intermediate Task Stack** (§5.4) → `θ_1`.
3. **Pivot Selection**
   - Use composite score (§3.1) to pick top-1 or top-2 S per T.
   - Validate on dev languages with existing XNLI to calibrate thresholds.
4. **Data Acquisition**
   - Gather NLI sets for S (MasakhaNLI-sw, Thai SNLI, Arabic XNLI).  Target size ≥10k each.
   - Collect 1–5k S–T sentence pairs for alignment head.
5. **MAFT + Vocabulary Pruning** (§5.1) on mixture of English+S.
6. **Alignment Head Fine-tune** (§5.2) while *freezing* main encoder.
7. **Optional Silver T NLI** (§5.5) – run only if compute budget allows.
8. **Evaluation**
   - XNLI test for S (to ensure no regression) and for T (zero-shot and/or silver dev).
   - Additional tasks (QA, NER) to monitor negative transfer (Learning 2 caveat).


## 7. Compute & Data Budget Snapshot
Assume XLM-R-Base (270 M params).

| Activity | GPU-h | VRAM (GB) | Notes |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Step 2   | 20    | 24        | 3 epochs MNLI+SQuAD+Hell.
| Step 5   | 15    | 24        | MAFT on 3×15k examples.
| Step 6   | 1     | 16        | Alignment head only.
| Total    | ~36   | — | Fits in 2×A100 days or 1×A100 overnight.

Tokenizer surgery requires CPU only; translation costs ≈$120 (1 M chars @ $15/50 M via LibreTranslate or self-hosted NMT).


## 8. Risks & Mitigations
1. **QA degradation** (Learning 2): verify on TyDi-QA; optionally keep a frozen copy for QA serving.
2. **Catastrophic forgetting**: blend a small English batch each epoch.
3. **Silver label noise**: filter by cross-model agreement ≥0.8.
4. **Vocabulary pruning corner cases**: track perplexity spikes; back-off to larger vocab if >5 % drop.


## 9. Forward-Looking / Contrarian Ideas (Flagged as Speculative)
- **Universal Phonological Adapters** (Learning 12) for script-mismatched pairs might add +2-3 XNLI points on Lao/Amharic at negligible cost.
- **ByT5-style char models** could eliminate tokenizer surgery entirely but need 2× compute; might shine for Ethiopic.
- **Chain-of-thought distillation**: distil English NLI explanations into multilingual encoders, hypothesised to enhance systematicity across languages.
- **Contrastive Language Interpolation** between S and T (mixup in embedding space).


## 10. Conclusion
Optimal zero-shot XNLI for low-resource languages is a multi-objective search.  The cumulative evidence suggests:

1. **Pick pivots algorithmically via linguistic distance** and ensure **tokenizer coverage**; script similarity is secondary.
2. Combine **MAFT + vocabulary pruning** with **tiny parallel alignment** for the best quality/compute ratio.
3. Preserve task-agnostic strengths by stacking **English intermediate tasks** first.
4. Silver translated NLI can squeeze out an extra point or two but beware label noise.

Under conservative budgets (≤2×A100 · day), we expect **+4‒7 absolute XNLI accuracy points** over the vanilla English-only baseline for Yoruba, Luganda, Lao and Amharic, with model size halved and no TL gold labels.
