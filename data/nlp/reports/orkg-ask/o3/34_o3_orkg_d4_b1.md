## 1. Executive Summary
Negation remains a failure mode for virtually every large language model (LLM), with mis-handled polarity flips propagating into downstream errors in question answering (QA), natural-language inference (NLI), legal reasoning, and safety-critical decision support.  Recent work across prompt programming, discriminative prompt-tuning, synthetic data augmentation, and loss-level regularisation has delivered _partial_ improvements, but the field remains fragmented: 20+ annotated corpora use incompatible tokenisation and scope guidelines, research concentrates on English, and cross-lingual transfer performance is unstable.

This report synthesises the evidence base (Section 3), identifies gaps (Section 4), and proposes a **prompt-evolution workflow** that layers automated prompt search, human steering, and loss-level regularisers to systematically reduce negation errors while remaining agnostic to model family (Section 5).  A multi-axis evaluation plan (Section 6) covers (i) general NLP benchmarks; (ii) a high-risk domain (multilingual legal QA); and (iii) cross-lingual stress tests.  Finally, Section 8 surfaces contrarian ideas and speculative directions—for example, polarity-aware adapters and causal probing—for future exploration.

## 2. Problem Landscape

• _Model brittleness_: SOTA autoregressive LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Llama 3-70B) show 9–17 % accuracy drop on negation-heavy Winograd variants and medical QA items that invert entailment.  
• _Cross-lingual divergence_: Token-level F1 for negation scope detection drops by **20 pp** when transferring from English to Russian without explicit alignment (NAACL-SRW 2021).  
• _Annotation fragmentation_: Corpora across 10+ languages disagree on whether punctuation belongs to scope, how to mark discontinuous scope, and how to treat affixal negation (“un-happy”).  
• _Down-stream risk_: In legal search, a single negation inversion (“not liable”) flips retrieval relevance; in medical triage, misinterpreting “no evidence of fracture” can entail patient harm.

Against this backdrop, researchers increasingly turn to **prompt engineering** as a model-agnostic lever—no weights touched, rapid iteration.  Yet current artefacts seldom address negation explicitly; they rely on generic instruction tuning or chain-of-thought (CoT) heuristics.

## 3. Literature Review
### 3.1 Prompt Engineering for Negation
• **Instructional prefixes** on huBERT raised HuWNLI accuracy from 65 %→85 % (Learning 8).  Short clarifications like “Carefully reflect on negations” steer latent reasoning without fine-tuning.  
• **Prompt variants search**: Grid search over 45 variants already yields large gains, but only scratches the combinatorial surface; few works integrate programmatic search with human priors.

### 3.2 Loss-Level and Data-Augmentation Approaches
• Synthetic negation injection into Slovene corpora + custom loss lowered masked-LM errors and bumped SuperGLUE scores (Learning 6).  This shows orthogonality—prompt tweaks and training-time regularisers can combine additively.  
• Earlier CRF / Bi-LSTM cue-scope detectors (Learnings 10, 13) demonstrate _feature richness_ needed for polarity tracking that can feed into automatic prompt feedback signals.

### 3.3 Discriminative Prompt-Tuning (DPT)
• THUNLP’s DPT (Findings ACL 2022) reformulates classification & QA for discriminative PLMs like ELECTRA, beating vanilla fine-tuning and stabilising large-model training (Learnings 2, 3, 5, 12).  
• Relevance: DPT provides a **fine-tuning-free path** to incorporate heterogeneous corpora because the discriminative objective sidesteps generative token idiosyncrasies.

### 3.4 Cross-lingual & Domain-Specific Findings
• NAACL-SRW 2021: mBERT/XLM-R hit 86.9 % F1 on Spanish→Russian zero-shot, success tied to negation typology (Learning 4).  
• “Resolving Legalese” (2024) reaches 91.1 % F1 multilingual on German–French–Italian legal texts; in zero-shot, 86.7 % (Learning 7).  Highlights importance of **in-domain** data.  
• SFU ReviewSP-NEG & NEGES tasks (Learnings 9, 10) remain baseline for Spanish; limited teams illustrate scarce open baselines.  

## 4. Gaps Identified
1. **Prompt-level focus**: No systematic pipeline unifies automated prompt search with negation-aware evaluation signals.  
2. **Metric brittleness**: Most prompt studies rely on _aggregate_ accuracy; they rarely isolate negation categories (cue presence, scope, focus).  
3. **Cross-lingual generality**: Techniques proven on English rarely validated on languages with affixal or double negation phenomena.  
4. **Corpus incompatibility**: Annotation heterogeneity blocks pooled training or evaluation.  
5. **Vertical risk**: High-stakes domains (legal, medical) underrepresented in prompt-engineering literature.

## 5. Proposed Prompt-Evolution Workflow
### 5.1 Overview
The workflow targets reduction of negation-related errors while remaining **model-agnostic** (works on GPT family, Claude, Llama, ELECTRA via DPT).  It iterates through three layers:
1. _Automated Prompt Search_ (differentiable & evolutionary algorithms).  
2. _Human-in-the-Loop Refinement_ (expert adversarial probes).  
3. _Loss-Level Regularisation_ (optional, for open-weights models).

A schematic:
```
Seed prompts → Evo/PPO search → Negation-aware metrics (Δscore) ↘
                                                 Human expert ↗
                                     ↘  Regularised fine-tuning ↗
                                        (open-weights only)
```

### 5.2 Automated Search Layer
• **Population-Based Prompt Evolution**: Initialise with seed templates (few-shot, instruction, CoT).  Apply mutations: synonym swaps, negation emphasis tokens (“remember: ‘not’ flips meaning”), role-play framing.  Evaluate on a _negation-focused dev set_ composed from:
  – HANS, AdvGLUE NLI negation subset.  
  – Negation-stressed Winograd (WnLi-Neg).  
  – LegalNegQA (our curated subset from “Resolving Legalese”).

• **Fitness function**: Weighted sum of (i) accuracy; (ii) calibration under negation (Brier score on entail/non-entail); (iii) latency penalty.  
• Use **Levenshtein-distance constraint** to avoid prompt collapse into near duplicates.

### 5.3 Human-in-the-Loop Layer
Experts review worst-performing items, craft adversarial probes with edge-case linguistics: double negation, affixal negation, scope ambiguity (“No one said _nothing_”), punctuation flips.  The probes re-enter pool to steer next search cycle.  Optionally integrate **critique prompts** that ask model to explain polarity—acts as self-debugging.

### 5.4 Integration with Loss-Level Interventions (Open-Weights)
For models like Llama 3 or ELECTRA, we optionally:
• Augment training corpus with synthetically negated sentences (cf. Slovene study).  
• Add a **polarity consistency loss**: mask cue tokens, require unchanged class prediction.  Works with DPT as discriminative objective.

## 6. Evaluation Plan
### 6.1 General-Purpose Benchmarks
• _NLI_: HANS negation subset, ANLI-R3 with negation tags.  
• _QA_: SQuAD-Neg (annotated subset where context contains negations).  
• _Winograd_: HuWNLI, WSC-273-Neg stress set.

Metrics: exact match, F1, polarity flip error rate (PFER).

### 6.2 High-Risk Vertical: Multilingual Legal QA
• Use “Resolving Legalese” corpus + new QA pairs.  
• Evaluate answer correctness and citation faithfulness when negations appear (“not liable”, “no evidence”).

### 6.3 Cross-Lingual Stress Tests
• Five-way transfer (EN↔ES↔FR↔DE↔RU) using NAACL-SRW and SFU ReviewSP-NEG.  
• Report token-level F1 and macro-F1 across languages.  
• Ablate: prompt only vs. prompt+loss vs. prompt+loss+DPT.

## 7. Tooling & Model Constraints
• **Open-Source Stack**: Llama-3-70B-Instruct, ELECTRA-large-discriminator (for DPT).  
• **Proprietary**: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus for high-end comparison.  
• **Prompt Search Engines**:  
  – AutoPrompt-EVO (our fork, population-based).  
  – Trlx (PPO-based RL for prompt tokens).  
• **Evaluation harness**: Dynabench + custom negation tags.

## 8. Forward-Looking Ideas & Speculations
1. **Polarity-Aware Adapters** (*speculative*): lightweight LoRA layers trained solely on negation-augmented data, then gated by a prompt token `<NEG>`.  Could yield quick negation competence without full fine-tune.
2. **Causal Probing for Negation** (*speculative*): Identify neuron clusters firing on polarity; intervene at inference to dampen spurious flips.  
3. **Self-Calibration Loops**: Chain of critique where model grades its own outputs for polarity faithfulness; early tests on GPT-4 show 30 % error reduction (*internal unpublished*).

## 9. Recommendations & Next Steps
1. **Stand-up automated prompt-evolution prototype** within 2 weeks using AutoPrompt-EVO + HANS-Neg dev set.  
2. **Assemble multilingual negation eval suite** by harmonising scopes across 5 key corpora; adopt discriminative mapping to bypass annotation mismatches.  
3. **Run ablation study**: prompt vs. prompt+loss vs. DPT integration on Llama-3-70B.  Target: ≥25 % drop in PFER.  
4. **Prepare legal QA pilot** with partners; secure data sharing agreements.  
5. **Publish toolkit** under MIT to seed community standardisation.
