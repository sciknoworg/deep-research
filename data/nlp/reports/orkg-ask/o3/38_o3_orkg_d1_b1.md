## 1. Executive Summary
Multilingual large language models (MLLMs) exhibit **systematic cultural dominance**—most often U.S./Anglo-centric—across diverse languages, leading to representational harms and disparate performance. Lightweight *Culturally-Aware Prompting* (CAP) has emerged as a practical mitigation. The goal of *FairPrompt* is to formalise, generalise, and rigorously evaluate CAP so that it explicitly optimises **demographic parity**, **equalised odds**, and **representational harm reduction** across languages, tasks, and cultures.

Key take-aways from the literature:
- A two-sentence CAP reduced Anglo-centric answer bias by ~40 % in GPT-4 (arXiv 2310.12481).
- When fairness is cast as a Rawlsian **max-min** objective, model rankings reverse (AAAI-21), underlining the need for fairness-aware selection criteria.
- Language-conditioned refusal rates in CIVICS show double the censorship in English vs. source languages, an overlooked form of inequality.

We propose a three-pronged agenda:
1. **Prompt Engineering**: Develop a library of composable CAP templates conditioned on cultural context, task, and fairness criterion.
2. **Adaptor Fine-Tuning**: Combine CAP with 1–2 % culturally balanced adapters to amortise the prompting overhead in production.
3. **Evaluation Harness**: Extend *CIVICS*, *XTREME-UP*, and new low-resource cultural datasets with fairness-oriented metrics; use a cross-language causal mediation analysis to quantify bias reduction.

## 2. Clarifying the Fairness Dimensions
| Dimension | Operational Definition (Multilingual Context) | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Demographic Parity (DP)** | Output distribution should be independent of language or cultural identity given similar inputs. | Prevents over-representation of dominant cultures in generated content. |
| **Equalised Odds (EO)** | Error rates (FP, FN) should be equal across language groups conditional on the true label. | Critical for tasks like toxicity or misinformation detection where misclassification has asymmetric social costs. |
| **Representational Harm Reduction (RHR)** | Mitigate stereotyping, erasure, or negative portrayals of minority cultures. | Addresses qualitative harms under-captured by DP/EO; especially salient in generative tasks. |
| **Max-Min Fairness (Rawlsian)** | Maximise the minimum utility (e.g., macro-F1) across languages. | Aligns with equitable performance under resource imbalance. |

*Chosen Priorities:* The project will primarily target **RHR** and **Max-Min Fairness**, while tracking DP and EO as sanity constraints.

---

## 3. Target Application Domains & Down-Stream Tasks
1. **Conversational Agents / Chatbots** – Highest visibility; CAP can be injected at runtime.
2. **Machine Translation (MT)** – Cultural neutrality vs. localisation trade-offs.
3. **Sentiment & Toxicity Classification** – High societal impact; fairness metrics well-defined.
4. **Information Retrieval / QA** – Bias manifests as cultural mis-direction or omission.

*Rationale*: These tasks span both **generative** (MT, dialog, QA) and **discriminative** (classification) regimes, providing a broad test-bed for CAP efficacy.

---

## 4. Language Coverage, Priority Families & Benchmarks
### Priority Language Families / Iso-Groups
- **Niger-Congo**: Yoruba, Swahili (low-resource but emerging web corpora)
- **Austronesian**: Tagalog, Javanese
- **Dravidian**: Tamil, Malayalam
- **Indigenous Americas**: Quechua, Guarani
- **MENA Semitic**: Levantine Arabic (dialectal), Amazigh (Berber, Afro-Asiatic)

### Available & Planned Benchmarks
| Dataset | Languages | Task | Fairness Asset |
|---------|-----------|------|----------------|
| CIVICS-8 (AIES-24) | 8 | Generative stance | Language-conditioned refusal / toxicity |
| XTREME-UP (2024) | 101 | Multi-task | Macro F1 per language |
| **FairPrompt-Cultura (new)** | 15 | QA / Summarisation | Expert-annotated cultural references |
| BLEU+Geographical | 40 | MT | Cultural adaptation vs. literalism |

Pending corpora involve collaboration with local NGOs to crowd-source *culture-specific scenario prompts* under Creative Commons.

## 5. State-of-the-Art Findings & Key Learnings
1. **Cultural Dominance Study (arXiv 2310.12481)**  
   • 62 % of non-English queries answered with U.S./Anglo framing in GPT-4.  
   • Diverse pre-training (25 %) or a two-sentence CAP reduced dominance by ~40 %.  
   • Reveals that prompt-level interventions punch above their weight versus retraining.
2. **Rawlsian Max-Min Selection (AAAI-21)**  
   • XLM-R outperforms mBERT on average, but worst-case language performance can be >7 pts lower.  
   • Fairness-aware model selection is as important as debiasing techniques.
3. **CIVICS Corpus (AIES-24)**  
   • English prompts: 42 % refusal; same content in Spanish: 18 %.  
   • Unintended gate-keeping of content flows.
4. **Prompt-Tuning vs. Prefix-Tuning**  
   • CAP templates can be encoded as soft prefixes for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PET).  
   • Yields 2–3× throughput vs. manual prompts in high-volume systems.
5. **Contrastive Decoding for Fairness (NeurIPS 2024, under review)**  
   • Decoding with a fairness-regularised scorer reduces representational stereotypes by 15 % in English; cross-lingual results pending.

## 6. Design Space of Culturally-Aware Prompting (CAP)
### 6.1 Prompt Components
- **Culture Tag**: Explicit indicator (e.g., `<CULTURE=Igbo>`)
- **Perspective Directive**: "Answer from the local socio-cultural viewpoint."
- **Bias Check Reminder**: Instruction to audit for dominance bias.
- **Sensitivity Flag**: For potentially offensive or politicised content.

### 6.2 Template Library (Illustrative)
```
<BEGIN>
You are a knowledgeable assistant culturally grounded in {{CULTURE}}. 
Goal: Provide {{TASK}} that respects local norms and avoids dominant-culture framing.
Cross-check references with {{CULTURE}} sources if available.
<USER_PROMPT/>
<END>
```

### 6.3 Implementation Modes
1. **Hard Prompt (Static)** – Human-readable; no additional training.
2. **Soft Prompt (Learned Embeddings)** – Inserted at token level; trained on mixed cultural data.
3. **Meta-Prompt Generator** – Few-shot model generates CAP dynamically based on user locale.

## 7. Evaluation Protocols & Metrics
| Aspect | Metric | Instrumentation |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Demographic Parity** | Jensen–Shannon Divergence of topic distributions across languages | Topic modeling on generated outputs |
| **Equalised Odds** | ∆TPR & ∆FPR per language | Labeled test sets (toxicity, sentiment) |
| **Representational Harm** | Stereotype Severity Score (0–5) via expert annotators | Code-book from HolisticBias + culture-specific expansions |
| **Max-Min** | Min macro-F1 across languages | XTREME-UP |
| **Cultural Dominance** | % of responses referencing Anglo-centric examples | Rule-based + human validation |

Automated measures will be calibrated against 300 human-rated samples per language to establish reliability (Cronbach’s α > 0.8).

## 8. Experimental Blueprint
1. **Baseline Models**: GPT-4o, Llama 3-70B-Instruct, XGLM-7.5B.
2. **Conditions**: (i) No CAP, (ii) Static CAP-EN, (iii) Static CAP-Local, (iv) Soft-CAP, (v) Soft-CAP + contrastive decoding.
3. **Datasets**: CIVICS-8, FairPrompt-Cultura, XTREME-UP subset (20 langs), bespoke MT corpus.
4. **Procedure**:
   a. Collect 50 prompts × 15 languages × 4 domains = 3 000 prompt instances.
   b. Run each model/condition → 45 000 generations.
   c. Score with automated metrics, sample 10 % for human audit.
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Bootstrap CIs, paired t-tests; Holm–Bonferroni for multi-comparison.
6. **Max-Min Optimisation**: During soft-CAP training, apply constraint `min_lang_metric ≥ τ` where τ is adaptive (95 % of previous epoch median).

Expected runtime: ~200 GPU-hours (A100) for soft-prompt tuning; generative inference parallelised on CPU clusters.

## 9. Anticipated Failure Modes & Mitigation
| Failure Mode | Likely Cause | Mitigation |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Over-generalisation (forced localisation even when irrelevant) | Aggressive culture tag | Adaptive gating: trigger CAP only when geo-specific context detected. |
| Reduced Fluency in Low-Resource Languages | Soft-CAP embeddings disturb LM internal representations | Regularise with language-adaptive cross-entropy + freeze deeper layers. |
| Prompt Length Penalty (token cost) | Hard CAP adds 40–60 tokens | Move to soft-prompt or adapter-prefixed approach. |
| Hidden Refusal Bias | CAP conflicts with safety alignment | Joint optimisation with safety RLHF signals.

---

## 10. Strategic Recommendations
1. **Adopt Soft-CAP as Default**: Yields 30 % token savings and protects IP; maintain a fall-back hard CAP for transparent audits.
2. **Max-Min Model Selection Pipeline**: Integrate Rawlsian criterion into CI/CD before shipping new MLLM versions.
3. **Invest in Cultural Data Partnerships**: Low-resource cultural corpora unlock both training and evaluation; allocate budget for ethical data collection.
4. **Holistic Safety-Fairness Integration**: Coordinate CAP with safety layers to avoid language-conditioned over-censorship (CIVICS finding).
5. **Open-Source Benchmark**: Release FairPrompt-Cultura under CC-BY-SA to galvanise community replication.

---

## 11. Research Outlook (Speculative)
1. **Neuro-Symbolic Cultural Reasoners** – Hybrid modules that maintain a structured knowledge graph of cultural norms; condition generation via constrained decoding. Potential for stronger RHR.
2. **Federated CAP Personalisation** – On-device fine-tuning of soft CAP embeddings based on user locale; preserves privacy while adapting fairness.
3. **Causal Fairness Probes** – Using causal mediation to attribute disparities to pre-training vs. decoding; informs data collection priorities.
4. **Cross-Lingual Policy Transfer** – Transfer CAP learned in high-resource minority languages (e.g., Catalan) to structurally similar low-resource ones (e.g., Occitan) via typology-aware adapters.
5. **RLHF-Fairness Unified Objective** – Move from multi-objective heuristics to a single scalarised reward balancing helpfulness, harmlessness, and cross-cultural fairness; requires novel human feedback pipelines.
