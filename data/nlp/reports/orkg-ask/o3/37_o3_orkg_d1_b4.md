# Final Report: Tree-of-Thought Prompting for Challenging Mathematical Proofs

*Date ≈ 2025-09-04*

---

## 0. Executive Summary

Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting is emerging as a unifying paradigm for steering large-language-model (LLM) theorem provers.  This report:  
* synthesises 13 disparate research findings ("learnings") into a coherent R&D roadmap;  
* compares design axes for new ToT strategies, hard-proof benchmarking, and tight integration with proof assistants; and  
* proposes concrete experiments, software architecture, and evaluation metrics.  

The central claim is that *proof-grade* ToT systems must couple three layers:

1. **Outer search orchestration** — domain-agnostic ToT prompting/branch management, augmented by statistical pruning.  
2. **Inner proof production** — trusted assistants (Lean/Coq/Isabelle) that can both *consume* and *emit* machine-checkable derivations.  
3. **Human–AI interaction tooling** — asynchronous IDEs, collaborative literature search, and graded difficulty ladders that keep the expert in the loop.

A staged research programme leveraging ESA-2018 #SAT, Coq Platform, D-trees, and *Lines-of-Thought* manifold analysis is technically feasible today and would constitute a novel large-scale benchmark for deliberate LLM reasoning.

## 1. Context and Motivation

### 1.1  From Chain- to Tree- of-Thought

*Chain-of-Thought* works by generating a single linear reasoning trace; PaLM-540B showed that just eight exemplars are enough to outperform GPT-3 + verifier on GSM8K.  Yet linear traces are brittle when the solution path contains dead ends.  *Tree-of-Thought* generalises this by branching on uncertain steps and backtracking under a value function.

Open-source implementations (ysymyth & Princeton-NLP, Zenodo 7992123/8118487) now make ToT reproducible, but their default value functions and memory layouts are toy-grade.  For difficult mathematical proofs — with deep quantifier alternations, symmetry, and large search spaces — better infrastructure is mandatory.

### 1.2  Three Complementary Research Axes

| Axis | Key Question | Typical Output |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **A. Novel ToT Strategies** | How should prompts, branching heuristics, and value functions be co-designed for theorem proving? | Prompt libraries, learned value models, pruning algorithms |
| **B. Benchmarking & Survey** | Which datasets, metrics, and baselines reveal genuine progress on *hard* proofs? | Reproducible benchmark suite, leaderboard |
| **C. Integration with Proof Assistants** | How can we guarantee soundness while still benefiting from LLM creativity? | Proof-producing bridges, IDE extensions, documentation |

Because the user left the follow-up answers blank, we assume interest in **all three axes**.

## 2. Synthesis of Prior Learnings

Below we map each learning (L1 – L13) onto the three axes.

| ID | Learning | Strategic Relevance |
|----|----------|--------------------|
| **L1** | Collaborative Literature Search System (CLSS) shows human-AI joint search at scale. | Axis B & C — supports dataset construction and interactive ideation. |
| **L2** | ESA-2018 #SAT benchmark with pre-computed tree decompositions. | Axis B — controlled treewidth enables stress-tests of ToT branching heuristics. |
| **L3** | Proof-producing bridges between SMT (CVC) and Isabelle/Coq identify translation and soundness pitfalls. | Axis C — blueprint for LLM ↔ proof-assistant coupling. |

## 3. Design Space for New ToT Prompting Strategies (Axis A)

### 3.1  Prompt Topology

* **Sequential Expansion** — baseline: expand each frontier node in turn.
* **Width-bounded Beam** — keep *k* best partial proofs via learned value.
* **Focused Subtree** — recursively expand the most promising branch until contradiction, then back-jump.

### 3.2  Value Functions

1. **LM Log-Prob** — naïve likelihood.
2. **Heuristic Fit** — statistical pruning à la Sutcliffe using problem features (symbol counts, syntactic depth).
3. **Manifold Distance** — deviation from low-dimensional SDE model (*Lines of Thought*) used as novelty bonus.

### 3.3  Memory-Efficient Representation

* **D-trees** (Inria 2004): pointer-less compressed tries; map naturally to CSR matrices, enabling batching on GPU/TPU.
* Hybrid CPU/GPU store for giant search trees: nodes in GPU memory until frozen, then off-loaded to CPU.

### 3.4  Prompt Engineering Templates

```text
You are a Lean prover. Try to prove <goal>. Here are <n> partial proof states. Expand each for at most <m> tactics. Use "state_id:" and "score:" markers. Avoid unsound shortcuts.
```

Embed example leaf-expansions (eight exemplars, GSM8K style) to prime the LM to produce Lean tactics rather than natural language.

## 4. Benchmarking & Survey Plan (Axis B)

### 4.1  Corpora

1. **ESA-2018 #SAT** — 2,720 WMC instances; use treewidth bins to study search-width vs proof-length.
2. **DeepThought Graded Proof Set** — difficulty ladder from propositional to first-order.
3. **MATH** & **MiniF2F** — mixed geometry, number theory.
4. **HOL Light Flyspeck lemmas** — real analysis edge cases.

### 4.2  Metrics

* **Success@T** — fraction of goals proved within T seconds.
* **Node-expansion count** — efficiency proxy.
* **Proof-length ratio** — generated vs ground-truth.
* **Assistant-check pass-rate** — Lean/Coq verification success.
* **Human comprehensibility rating** — 5-point Likert, sampled.

### 4.3  Experimental Protocol

1. Freeze LM parameters (e.g., GPT-4o, Phi-3-mini) to isolate prompting gains.  
2. Run ToT variants: baseline CoT, width-2 beam, statistical prune.  
3. For each dataset, allocate identical compute budget.  
4. Publish raw trees + Lean/Coq scripts for reproducibility.

### 4.4  Collaborative Literature Search Workflow

Leverage CLSS to continuously ingest new ToT publications; embed graph visualisations into benchmark leaderboard site so researchers can trace citation clusters before proposing new baselines — reducing duplication.

## 5. Integration with Proof Assistants (Axis C)

### 5.1  Architecture

```
      ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
      │  LLM-Orchestrator (Python)                 │
      │  – Tree Manager (D-trees)                  │
      │  – Prompt Generator                        │
      │  – Value Function Plug-ins                 │
      └───────────▲────────────────────────────────┘
                  │ tactical script              (Lean/Coq)
                  │ proof state / error          (JSON)
      ┌───────────┴────────────────────────────────┐
      │  Proof Assistant Kernel (Lean/Coq)        │
      │  – Modified PIDE protocol over TCP        │
      │  – Proof-producing SMT/ATP bridges        │
      └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

*Re-using PIDE* (L4) reduces the effort to surface proof states and allow asynchronous ToT exploration.

### 5.2  Soundness Guarantees

1. **Proof-producing only:** Any SMT/LLM suggestion must ultimately be replayed as kernel-checked tactics.  
2. **Kernel paraphrase checks:** After LLM emits a Lean proof, a second Lean process replays it from scratch to prevent hidden state.  
3. **Traceability metadata:** Each node in the ToT stores the originating prompt & LM logits for audit.

### 5.3  Human-AI Collaboration Features

* Live rendering of multiple branches; collapsed nodes summarised by LLM.
* Comment threads per node, synced via CLSS citation links.
* Difficulty auto-tuning: tasks pulled from DeepThought ladder to avoid over- or under-challenging the user.

## 6. Proposed Research Programme (18-Month Timeline)

| Month | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| 0-2 | Fork OSS ToT repo; implement D-tree storage; unit test on GSM8K. |
| 3-5 | Integrate Lean 4 via PIDE-style protocol; minimal soundness checks. |
| 6-8 | Benchmark on ESA-2018 #SAT; publish pre-lim leaderboard. |
| 9-10 | Embed statistical pruning model; measure Node-expansion ↓. |
| 11-13 | Release v1.0 benchmark harness & dataset (MATH, DeepThought). |
| 14-16 | User study with expert mathematicians (Royal Library methodology). |
| 17-18 | Write journal paper; open-source dataset + toolchain.

Risk mitigation: if Lean integration stalls, fall back to Isabelle where PIDE is native.

---

## 7. Contrarian & Forward-Looking Ideas (Flagged Speculative)

* **Low-Dimensional Controller** — Train a tiny diffusion model in the *Lines of Thought* latent space to propose entire proof subtrees, effectively compressing thousands of LM calls. *(Speculative)*
* **GPU-resident Kernel** — Co-locate a Rust-re-implementation of the Lean kernel on GPU; would remove Python-to-Lean round-trip latency. *(Highly speculative)*
* **Proof NFTs for Incentives** — Successful proofs minted as NFTs whose metadata includes the full ToT trace, rewarding open proofs. *(Speculative & socio-technical)*

---

## 8. Recommendations

1. **Start with ESA-2018 #SAT**: immediate availability of tree decompositions makes it ideal for stress-testing branching heuristics.  
2. **Adopt PIDE protocol**: proven portable with minimal changes (Coq port in 2 months).  
3. **Embed statistical pruning early**: avoids combinatorial blow-up witnessed in naïve ToT.  
4. **Publish raw trees**: transparency addresses reproducibility and trust concerns.  
5. **Allocate UX budget**: Royal Library findings warn that retrieval-quality perception matters; IDE polish will impact adoption.

---

## 9. Conclusion

By weaving together advances in prompt engineering, search pruning, proof-assistant infrastructure, and human-AI collaboration, we can push ToT prompting from toy puzzles to *proof-grade* mathematics.  The proposed roadmap exploits every prior learning listed, translating them into concrete design choices and experiments.  If executed, it will deliver both scientific insight into LLM reasoning manifolds and practical tools for mathematicians and formal-methods engineers alike.
