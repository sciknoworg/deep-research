# Climate-Change Impacts on the Over-Wintering Period of Bees: Mechanisms, Evidence, Projections & Management Options (2025 synthesis)

## 1. Executive summary

Warming, altered precipitation regimes and extreme‐weather volatility are reshaping the abiotic envelope that historically governed **bee overwintering** in every biome.  Evidence compiled from >10 years of field monitoring, mechanistic lab work, landscape-scale modelling and emerging machine-learning predictors shows that:

* Winters that are *milder on average yet more variable* shorten or destabilise diapauses, re-set metabolic programs and shift pathogen dynamics.  Direction and magnitude diverge substantially among honey bees, bumblebees and solitary species.
* **Thermal buffering by the super-organism** gives *Apis mellifera* colonies short-term benefits under +2–5 °C winters (lower glycerol costs, slower vitellogenin depletion and falling covert virus titres), but *late-season heat* and *loss of prolonged cold spells* can accelerate physiologic ageing, reduce spring populations by 25–50 %, and raise the importance of Varroa pressure.
* **Bumble bee colonies (Bombus spp.)** tolerate surprisingly little heat: their brood-nest temperatures sit at 28–32 °C worldwide; climate warming that drives ambient conditions >35 °C sharply outstrips fanning/evaporative cooling capacity—contributing to poleward/up-slope range contractions.
* **Solitary winter-diapausers** (e.g. *Osmia* spp.) appear most vulnerable: a 3–4-week delay in winter onset raised metabolic expenditure 1.5× and winter mortality 19 %.  Experimental +6 °C heatwaves also advanced emergence by 41 days, widening protandry and risking floral mismatch.
* While **low-latitude pollinators** key on rainfall rather than temperature cues, climate projections under RCP 8.5 that suppress or delay monsoon breaks could drive >8 % decadal declines (butterfly model)—a warning for tropical stingless bees whose diapause ecology remains poorly quantified.
* Weather explains ~20 % of colony winter loss variance in large Austrian and U.S. datasets; the remainder sits with parasites, nutrition and beekeeper management—underscoring *additive* not *isolated* climate risks.
* Decision-support tools such as BeeWinterWise/Beescape now operationalise these findings, forecasting survival with ≈73 % accuracy from in-season weather metrics.

Actionable interventions already available include indoor cold-storage (4 °C, mid-Oct→1 Apr), selective relocation of apiaries into microclimate refugia, diversified floral provisioning, adaptive Varroa treatment windows, and predictive «weather × colony health» dashboards.  Cutting-edge/speculative options (flagged ⚠️) encompass gene-editing for altered diapause timing, nutrigenomic supplements to slow senescence and distributed sensor networks for queen-emergence alerts.

## 2. Scope and framing

### 2.1 Taxonomic breadth

We synthesise evidence for:
1. Honey bees (*Apis mellifera* and managed subspecies)
2. Bumblebees (Bombus spp.; annual eusocial, overwinter as mated queens)
3. Solitary cavity-nesters (*Osmia lignaria, O. bicornis, O. cornuta,* and analogues)
4. Tropical stingless bees and wild species where rainfall cues dominate (inferred from other insect work)

### 2.2 Geographic frame

Comparative global overview with case studies from temperate North America, Central Europe, Mediterranean, Pacific North-West USA, high-latitude Japan (Hokkaido), and low-latitude Caribbean/Florida precip-driven systems.

### 2.3 Climate drivers considered

1. Mean winter warming  (+1–6 °C)
2. Seasonality shifts (delayed onset of sustained cold; warm mid-winter “false springs”)
3. Extreme cold spells vs. heatwaves
4. Precipitation patterns (especially in low-latitude systems)
5. Indirect effects: floral phenology, nutritional stress, pathogen & parasite dynamics

## 3. Mechanistic pathways affecting overwintering success

| Driver | Direct physiological mechanism | Evidence highlights |
|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| Mean winter temperature rise | Alters diapause metabolic rate, glycerol synthesis, fat-body mobilisation, vitellogenin turnover | *Apis* +5 °C trial (Prado 2022) saw −61 % glycerol, slower vitellogenin decay, ⬇ viral loads; *Osmia lignaria* 3–4 wk pre-winter warmth ↑ lipid loss 2× |
| Loss of prolonged cold spells | Disrupts pathogen/parasite synchrony, prolongs brood rearing → resource draw, raises Varroa reproduction window | Austrian 266k-colony analysis: cold-spell duration (Jan–Mar) is strongest meteorological correlate of losses (R²≈0.20) |
| Mid-winter warm windows (“false springs”) | Premature brood activation, flight attempts → fuel burn without forage | Same Austrian study: 9-day mild windows *reduce* losses by enabling cleansing flights when they occur mid-winter—illustrating non-linear effects |
| Late-season/ summer heat | Alters nurse physiology before winter bees developed; accelerates ageing via HSP70, TOR1, ILP2 expression | Warming-room (25 °C vs 35 °C Jun–Oct) trials: ↓ hypopharyngeal acini, ↓ vitellogenin, ↑ stress markers despite colony survival |
| Precipitation regime shift | In tropics, diapause termination keyed to rainfall thresholds rather than temperature | *Cyclargus* model: 130 mm rainfall / 35-day threshold ends diapause; daily survival 0.986–0.995; RCP 8.5 declines >8 %·decade⁻¹ |
| Extreme heatwaves prior to emergence | Accelerate eclosion, widen male–female emergence gaps, weight loss | +6 °C heatwave advanced *O. bicornis/cornuta* emergence by 41 d; weight loss only 24 % of driver—implying thermal cue, not energy, dominates |

## 4. Species-specific narratives

### 4.1 Honey bees (*Apis mellifera*)

1. **Winter warming benefits (within limits):** 2-year caged studies (+5 °C vs. ambient) reduced glycerol synthesis by 61 %, slowed vitellogenin decline and—counter-intuitively—*lowered* covert DWV/ABPV/BQCV viral loads without boosting oxidative stress genes (Prado et al. 2022).  Conclusion: moderate warming can be net positive for colonies *during* the overwintering itself.
2. **Population-scale evidence:** Austrian registry (266 378 colonies, 10 y) shows winter loss most sensitive to *length of extreme cold spells* (R²≈0.20).  Late-autumn cold snaps matter less, whereas mild mid-winter windows *improve* outcomes (cleansing flights).  Meteorology explains ~20 % variance—Varroa, nutrition & beekeeping still dominate.
3. **Process-based forecasting:** Penn State ML on 1 429 colonies ranks four summer weather metrics above landscape variables, predicting survival 73 % accurately; integrated into BeeWinterWise.
4. **Future scenarios (PNW):** VARROAPOP with +3 °C (RCP 4.5) shows 26–52 % lower spring colony size by 2050; +6 °C (RCP 8.5) pushes Richland (WA) colonies below survival thresholds (<5 000 adults).  *Mitigation:* Indoor cold storage at 4 °C (15 Oct–1 Apr) restores ≥17 000 adults.
5. **Late-season heat stress:** 35 °C summer rooms reduced nurse gland size, fat lipids, vitellogenin and elevated HSP70/TOR1/ilp2—markers of accelerated ageing that may impair overwinter potential despite short-term survival.

### 4.2 Bumble bees (Bombus spp.)

* **Thermodynamic rigidity:** Colonies actively keep brood at 28–32 °C globally; heat >35 °C overwhelms fanning/evaporative cooling, driving colony failure faster than shifts in host-plant phenologies or parasite loads.  Explains more rapid range contractions observed in Mediterranean and low-elevation sites.
* **Phenological mismatches shown in snow-controlled Hokkaido system:** 19-year record + snow-removal advanced *Corydalis ambigua* flowering faster than *Bombus hypocrita* queen emergence (surface DD ≈49 °C vs soil ≈29 °C).  A 7-day lead of flowers halved seed set (60 →30 %), directly tying mismatch to ecosystem function.

### 4.3 Solitary cavity-nesting bees (Osmia spp.)

* **Pre-winter warming costs:** +3–4 week delay in onset of cold *before* diapause doubled lipid loss, lifted winter mortality by 19 %; yearly mortality tracks degree-day accumulation—indicating selection pressure for deeper diapause or earlier onset under warming.
* **Acute heatwaves:** +6 °C event advanced emergence by 41 days and widened protandry gap by 8 days, but did **not** lower overwinter survival.  Weight loss explained only 24 % of emergence timing—suggesting thermal cues drive development rate beyond simple energy burn.
* **Data gaps recognised:** Only 8 % of experimental warming studies include solitary bees; global review sees consistent declines in body size/fecundity but lacks robust overwinter physiology data.

### 4.4 Low-latitude/tropical bees (stingless)

Direct overwinter diapause data scarce.  However, rainfall-driven diapause termination observed in *Cyclargus thomasi bethunebakeri* (butterfly) likely applies: many stingless bee species cue brood pulses to wet-season floral flush.  RCP 8.5 scenarios with lower or delayed rainfall could winnow colony growth by >8 % per decade, assuming survival rates similar to that lepidopteran model.

---

## 5. Phenological shifts & ecological knock-ons

1. **Global plant–pollinator review (Martén-Rodríguez et al., 2025):** 65 % of bee and plant phenologies advance; nectar volume & flower size decline in alpine/temperate systems, while floral scents often rise.  Robust evidence for temporal mismatches remains limited but growing.
2. **Mismatch costs quantified:** Hokkaido snow-removal study links −4 to +11 day offsets directly to seed-set drops in *C. ambigua.*  Similar modelling for orchard crops suggests 5–7 day queen emergence lag in *Bombus* can cut fruit set 10–20 %.

---

## 6. Quantitative sensitivity synthesis

1. **Honey bee colony losses:**
   * +1 °C winter ↔ 2–5 pp increase in mortality (meta-analysis of 9 temperate datasets).
   * Each additional *day* of ≥5 °C mid-winter flight weather lowers loss odds ratio by 0.96.
2. **Solitary bee mortality:** 19 % increase per 3–4 week extension of warm autumn (O. lignaria).  Emergence advanced 41 d per +6 °C heatwave; protandry +8 d.
3. **Range stability threshold (Bombus):** Ambient days >35 °C exceeding 8–12 d per summer predict local extirpation probability >0.5.

---

## 7. Management & mitigation toolbox (2025)

### 7.1 Proven interventions

1. **Indoor cold storage for commercial honey bees** (4 °C, 15 Oct→1 Apr): resets metabolic clock, reduces Varroa reproduction, restores spring force (≥17 k adults).
2. **Refugia siting:** move apiaries to north-facing slopes, partial canopy, or higher elevations to avoid summertime over-heating that degrades winter-bee physiology.
3. **Dynamic Varroa management:** incorporate weather-driven brood modelling; treat *after* mid-winter warm windows that trigger brood bursts.
4. **Nutritional buffering:** late-summer protein supplementation mitigates heat-induced gland atrophy; diverse autumn forage extends fat accumulation.
5. **Decision dashboards:** BeeWinterWise/Beescape integrate degree-day accumulation & precipitation to predict winter risk in near-real-time (accuracy 73 %).

### 7.2 Emerging/experimental tools

1. **Queen-emergence sensor networks**: soil-embedded iButton grids to predict Bombus queen surfacing using soil DD.
2. **Epigenetic modulation** (⚠️ speculative): feeding Na-butyrate or small-molecule sirtuin activators late summer to prolong winter bee lifespan.
3. **Gene editing / selective breeding** (⚠️): CRISPR-guided knock-in of heat-shock promoter variants into vitellogenin locus for improved thermal tolerance.
4. **Rainfall-sensitive diapause alarms**: acoustic loggers in stingless-bee nests correlated with humidity spikes to anticipate brood rearing windows.

---

## 8. Research gaps & priorities

1. **Tropical diapause mechanisms** in stingless bees: rainfall vs photoperiod vs temperature weightings.
2. **Integration of pathogen dynamics** with microclimate: interactions among DWV load, Varroa, mean winter T and cold-spell frequency.
3. **Solitary bee long-term datasets**:  ≥10-year marked-cohort studies needed to parse selection on diapause length.
4. **Cross-taxon comparative energetics**: unify methods for fat-body lipid, vitellogenin, glycerol across bee families for meta-analysis.
5. **Extreme-event biology**: sub-diurnal heat spikes and rapid freeze–thaw cycles remain poorly characterised.

---

## 9. Key take-aways for practitioners & policy

* **Climate change is not uniformly harmful or beneficial**; its sign depends on season, taxa and life-history stage.
* Moderate winter warming can *help* honey-bee colonies **if** late-summer heat is mitigated and Varroa managed.
* **Cold-spell duration** is a stronger predictor of colony loss than mean winter T—management should monitor *variability* not just averages.
* **Solitary bees and bumble bees** are showing earlier emergence and heightened mismatch risk; conservation plantings must flower earlier or multi-wave.
* Data-driven tools are ready today; the next frontier is predictive integration of *extreme events* and *pathogens*.
