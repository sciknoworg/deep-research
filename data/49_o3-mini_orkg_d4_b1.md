# Final Report: When Mowing Can Be More Efficient Than Grazing in Restoring Plant Diversity

This report synthesizes extensive research findings on the restoration of plant diversity through management practices, with a focus on comparing mowing and grazing. The analysis embarks on a multispectral examination of both singular and integrated management strategies, their temporal dynamics (short-term recovery vs. long-term sustainability), and context-specific effectiveness across ecosystems. Detailed insights from longitudinal experiments, mechanistic studies, and ecosystem-level evaluations are combined to provide a comprehensive answer to the query: "When could mowing be more efficient than grazing in restoring plant diversity, and why?"

## 1. Overview of Restoration Strategies

The restoration of plant diversity in degraded grasslands or semi-natural ecosystems relies on disturbance regimes that reduce competitive exclusion, facilitate the establishment of subordinate species, and manage litter accumulation. Both mowing and grazing as disturbance interventions are backed by extensive research:

- **Mowing** is often employed to remove biomass, suppress the dominance of competitive or invasive species, and create a more heterogeneous microenvironment that supports early-successional species and overall taxonomic diversity.
- **Grazing** introduces a suite of additional biophysical effects (e.g., animal trampling, nutrient deposition via dung and urine) that can modulate soil properties including soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and microbial activity. However, grazing may induce a decoupling of above- and belowground processes under certain intensities, impacting biodiversity outcomes.

## 2. Mechanisms of Mowing in Plant Diversity Restoration

### 2.1 Immediate and Short-Term Mechanisms

Research in Mediterranean, boreal, and sub-Mediterranean ecosystems has repeatedly shown that biannual or annual mowing can immediately reduce the dominance of competitive, tall grass species while facilitating the re-establishment of forbs and less aggressive species. In the central Apennines, studies on sites invaded by *Brachypodium rupestre* reveal that repeated mowing successfully creates conditions for weakened competitors to re-establish, thereby increasing taxonomic diversity. Key mechanisms include:

- **Reduction of Light and Nutrient Competition:** By removing excessive biomass, mowing exposes lower canopy layers and soil surfaces, promoting the germination and growth of understorey species.
- **Maintenance of Disturbance Regimes:** Regular mowing prevents litter build-up and accumulation of woody debris that could hinder seedling recruitment. Experimental evidence further shows that annual mowing is effective in maintaining species richness and evenness, as disturbance regimes are critical in preventing competitive exclusion.

### 2.2 Long-Term Community Shifts

Over extended periods (e.g., multi-year studies up to 30 years), mowing has been shown to not only enhance biodiversity but also prompt shifts toward plant communities that exhibit traits adaptive to mowing (for example, reduced plant height and leaf area). Notably, studies observe that:

- **Functional Trait Shifts:** Long-term mowing favors species with morphological traits adapted to repeated biomass removal, which can lead to stable and resilient plant communities under continued disturbance regimes. 
- **Ecosystem Multifunctionality:** Restoration interventions that combine mowing with graduated intensity strategies (e.g., integrating seed additions or minimal soil disturbance) have achieved multifunctionality levels comparable to targeted seminatural grasslands. In some cases, plant species richness explains up to 54% of this multifunctionality at minimal cost over a 22-year period.

## 3. Comparing Mowing and Grazing: Context, Mechanisms, and Trade-offs

### 3.1 Grazing: Advantages and Limitations

While mowing is highly effective in enhancing plant diversity through its direct removal of biomass, grazing introduces additional functionalities: 

- **Enhanced Soil Dynamics:** Grazing, particularly at optimal intensities, has been documented to enhance surface SOC, boost microbial biomass, and improve nutrient cycling processes. Grazed systems often see reduced lignin content and increased microbial enzyme activities that promote efficient carbon and nitrogen retention. 
- **Differential Legacy Effects:** However, grazing sometimes can lead to an overabundance of soil nitrogen owing to dung and urine inputs, which under low-intensity regimes might create an excess nitrogen effect. This can decouple above- and belowground ecosystem functions, potentially reducing plant diversity in certain contexts.
- **Integrated Ecosystem Management:** Adaptive grazing systems such as multi-paddock or rotational grazing have been effective in Mollisols, contributing to substantial increases in persistent organic carbon. Nevertheless, where the maintenance of a frequent, predictable disturbance regime is necessary for plant diversity restoration, mowing demonstrates a more consistent outcome.

### 3.2 Mowing as a Superior Strategy in Specific Contexts

Mowing can be more suitable than grazing under the following conditions:

- **Ecosystems Sensitive to Disturbance Regimes:** In ecosystems where maintaining a consistent, controlled disturbance is critical—such as semi‐natural grasslands of southern Sweden or the Eurasian steppe—mowing has been more effective in sustaining plant species composition and diversity over prolonged periods (8–38 years). 
- **Suppression of Litter Accumulation:** Annual mowing prevents excessive litter build-up, which is particularly beneficial in systems where woody species or tall grasses might otherwise dominate and shade out less competitive species.
- **Controlled Frequency and Intensity:** With mowing, the frequency (e.g., annual vs. every third year) has a profound impact on species diversity outcomes. Studies indicate that annual mowing maintains higher species richness and evenness compared to reduced frequency, which can result in a staggering 5–60% decline in biodiversity measures (based on Shannon and Gini-Simpson indices) over medium to long-term restoration regimes.

## 4. Integrated Land Management Strategies

While the query focuses on the scenarios where mowing can outperform grazing, it is essential to recognize that restoration practices rarely occur in isolation. Integrated land management strategies that combine various techniques can sometimes leverage the strengths of both mowing and grazing. Key considerations include:

- **Rotational Systems:** Incorporating diverse grassland rotations and legume introductions along with mowing ensures improved soil microbial biomass, enzyme activities, and overall soil health. These integrated practices are context-dependent, with soil microbial community composition showing marked changes (such as transitions in fungal:bacterial ratios) over time.
- **Agro-Ecological Context:** In highly productive areas, mowing tends to maintain plant diversity more effectively than grazing by providing a consistent disturbance. In contrast, in less productive areas where nutrient cycling is a limiting factor, the grazing-induced soil enhancements (higher SOC and microbial biomass) might be critical for long-term sustainability. The trade-offs, therefore, depend on the landscape’s primary restoration goals: plant diversity versus soil function enhancement.
- **Depth-Dependent Effects:** It is crucial to differentiate the impacts on surface soils (0–20 cm) where plant species richness drives microbial activity from those in deeper layers (20–50 cm) where belowground biomass and total nitrogen play larger roles. A combined approach that uses mowing to restore surface diversity and grazing to enhance deeper soil functions could represent an innovative, dual regime strategy in certain landscapes.

## 5. Recommendations and Future Directions

Based on the synthesis of research findings, the following recommendations are proposed for contexts in which mowing may be more efficient than grazing for restoring plant diversity:

1. **Prioritize Mowing in Systems Requiring Consistent Disturbance:** For ecosystems where the suppression of competitive, dominant species is paramount (e.g., invasions by *Brachypodium rupestre* or tall grass species), employ regular (annual or biannual) mowing schedules to maintain high species richness and functional diversity.

2. **Optimize Mowing Frequency:** Ensure that the mowing frequency is calibrated to prevent litter accumulation but not so frequent as to inhibit the establishment of slower-growing forbs. Empirical evidence suggests that annual mowing outperforms reduced frequencies in maintaining ecosystem biodiversity metrics (species richness and evenness).

3. **Combine with Targeted Interventions:** Use mowing in tandem with interventions such as seed additions and selective fertilizer/FYM treatments. This approach can accelerate the re-establishment of desired species while supporting the targeted enhancement of soil microbial communities and nutrient dynamics.

4. **Contextualize Within a Broader Management Framework:** In moderately productive landscapes or where long-term sustainability (including soil carbon and nutrient dynamics) is also a target, consider an integrated management approach where mowing is the primary technique for biodiversity restoration while controlled grazing regimes are used periodically to enhance soil processes.

5. **Tailor Practices to Ecosystem Specifics:** Evaluate the trade-offs—the need for low-intensity mowing in certain semi-natural European grasslands versus the benefits of grazing in Mollisols under climate-smart agriculture. Future research should explore adaptive frameworks that optimize spatial and temporal mosaics of disturbance regimes.

6. **Monitor Legacy Effects:** Establish long-term monitoring programs that track changes in plant community composition, soil microbial dynamics, and the overall multifunctionality of the ecosystem. This data is crucial to adjust management practices and validate the long-term effectiveness of mowing versus grazing interventions.

## 6. Conclusion

Mowing emerges as an efficient tool for restoring plant diversity particularly in ecosystems where a sustained disturbance regime is required to curb competitive exclusion and foster a heterogeneous plant assemblage. While grazing offers notable benefits in terms of soil organic carbon and nutrient cycling, its variable effects on species diversity make mowing the preferable choice under certain conditions—especially in systems regularly impacted by invasive species or woody encroachment. The future of restoration practices may lie in integrated management strategies that judiciously combine mowing and grazing to harness the benefits of both approaches, tailored precisely to the ecosystem, climatic context, and restoration goals.

Advancing these strategies requires an adaptive approach with continuous monitoring and context-specific adjustments. Given the dynamic nature of these ecosystems, further comparative experiments, especially over extended chronosequences, are recommended to refine our understanding and operational tactics.

This comprehensive body of evidence provides both a theoretical and practical basis to recommend mowing as a primary tool in certain restoration contexts while also paving the way for more nuanced, integrated land management strategies.

*Note: While these findings and recommendations are derived from extensive past-year experimental studies, further research is needed, particularly in emerging ecosystems and under new climatic challenges, to fully integrate these insights into a broader restoration framework.*
