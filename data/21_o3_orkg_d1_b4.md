## 1. Executive Summary

• **No universal reduction in soil microbial diversity accompanies grassland extensification.**  Instead, responses are decidedly context-dependent, with soil pH, climate, and legacy land use frequently outweighing management intensity per se.  
• **Fungal guilds appear more sensitive to extensification than bacteria.**  A five-country European transect showed saprotrophic fungal biomarkers peaking in extensively managed grasslands, whereas bacterial composition largely tracked edapho-climatic gradients rather than management.  
• **Magnitude and direction of change vary by biome and time-scale.**  Short-term (≤5 yr) extensification can trigger transient increases in α-diversity, yet 30-plus-year grazing exclusion in semiarid China eventually depressed carbon stocks and altered aggregate-scale microbiomes.  
• **Functional resilience is high.**  Across a 3.6 M km² North-American prairie–cropland transect, genes for denitrification and starch degradation remained abundant after centuries of cultivation, illustrating functional redundancy despite taxonomic turnover.

Overall, the question “Does grassland extensification reduce soil microbial diversity?” must be answered **no in a general sense**, but caveated by biome-specific, functional-specific, and temporal considerations detailed below.

## 2. Definitions and Scope

**Extensification (this review)**  
Reduction in one or more of the following relative to conventional/intensive grassland management:
1. Stocking rate (livestock units ha⁻¹) or full grazing exclusion.  
2. External inputs (synthetic N, P, K fertilizers; pesticides).  
3. Harvest frequency (mowing/cutting events yr⁻¹).  

**Microbial diversity**  
• *Taxonomic α-diversity*: OTU/ASV richness, Shannon or Simpson indices within a soil sample.  
• *Taxonomic β-diversity*: compositional dissimilarity (Bray–Curtis, UniFrac, etc.) among samples.  
• *Functional gene diversity*: richness or relative abundance of genes linked to C, N, P cycling or specific metabolic pathways (metagenomics, GeoChip, qPCR panels).  

Unless stated otherwise, diversity changes are expressed as % difference relative to intensive baselines.

## 3. Conceptual Framework: Mechanistic Pathways

1. **Resource Stoichiometry** – reduced N inputs can shift C:N:P ratios, selecting for oligotrophic taxa, often increasing OTU richness but potentially lowering functional gene abundance tied to N-cycling.  
2. **Disturbance Regime** – lower mowing or stocking frequency reduces physical disturbance and dung/urine deposition heterogeneity, with ambiguous effects on spatial turnover (β-diversity).  
3. **Plant–Microbe Feedbacks** – extensification often alters botanical composition (e.g., more legumes or forbs), which indirectly structures rhizosphere communities via root exudates (cf. Jena Experiment).  
4. **Soil Chemical Feedbacks** – withdrawal of acidifying fertilizer commonly raises soil pH; because pH is a master variable for bacteria, this can either boost or suppress diversity depending on the starting point (see Section 7).

## 4. Evidence by Biome & Region

### 4.1 Temperate European Grasslands

**Five-Country Transect (Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Mainland Portugal, Azores)**  
• Bacterial community composition mostly mirrored *regional* edapho-climatic conditions, not management intensity.  
• Saprotrophic fungal biomarkers **peaked in extensively managed sites**, supporting niche expansion for litter-decomposing guilds under lower grazing pressure.

**Norway–France–N. Italy 2,600 km Transect**  
• Soil pH explained the bulk of bacterial variance; **management type (pasture vs. meadow) had no detectable effect** on either community structure or N-cycling gene profiles, implying functional equivalence between cutting and grazing at continental scale.

**12 km² Mixed-Farming Catchment (W. Europe, n = 186)**  
• Converting annual crops → pastures produced a strong **DNA biomass increase** (+23 % temporary; +93 % permanent) and moderate **fungal OTU richness gains** (+10–14.5 %).  
• Tillage intensity only added a minor +2.4 % to bacterial richness, reinforcing the notion that *land-use shift* rather than mowing frequency dominates.

**Jena Experiment (Germany, 82 plots, 2003-2014)**  
• Plant functional-group composition—not species richness nor explicit management—controlled stability of microbial respiration and biomass. Extensification shifts botanical composition, thus indirectly propagating to microbial processes.

**SOERE PRO-EFELE (Rennes, 10 yr)**  
• Annual organic vs. mineral fertilization kept total molecular biomass stable; α-diversity unchanged.  
• β-diversity diverged over time, illustrating that *composition* changes even when richness is static.

### 4.2 North American Prairies

**Wisconsin–Iowa–Kansas Prairie–Cropland Transect**  
• Native prairie soils held **2 × microbial biomass** of adjacent corn fields, yet cultivated plots paradoxically exhibited **higher α-diversity**, consistent with the “more benign but resource-limited” hypothesis for farmland soils.  
• Functional resilience notable: denitrification and starch-degradation genes persisted after ≥100 yr cultivation.

**Great Plains Clipping Trial (2010-2014)**  
• Annual clipping elevated root + microbial respiration; after 3-5 yr, genes for recalcitrant-C degradation and N/P cycling **up-regulated**, indicating accelerated SOM loss—*without significant change in OTU richness*.  
• Precipitation modulated magnitude of functional shifts.

### 4.3 Asian Steppe & Semi-Arid Systems

**36-yr Grazing-Exclusion Chronosequence, Semiarid China**  
• Non-linear trajectory: 11–26 yr exclusion maximized C sequestration and nutrient-cycling genes; extending to 36 yr **depressed C stocks**, with pH emerging as the key microhabitat driver.

**Chinese Meadow Steppe Grazing-Intensity Study**  
• Light stocking (4 sheep ha⁻¹) **boosted bacterial diversity** in forb/legume patches.  
• Heavy stocking (6 sheep ha⁻¹) depressed most diversity indices; shifts correlated with soil N:P ratio, EC, total N, and pH.

### 4.4 Cross-Biome & Global Syntheses

**Global Synthesis of ‘Global-Change’ Drivers**  
• Microbial diversity declines mainly when drivers shift soil pH; other drivers deliver mixed or neutral outcomes.  
• Implication: **Extensification benefits are contingent on starting pH and its trajectory**.

**Meta-Analysis of Grass-Legume Mixtures (2,753 experiments, 1963-2016)**  
• Adding a single legume boosts plant productivity by 44 % globally, but >2 legumes yield diminishing returns.  
• Relevance: extensification often increases botanical legume abundance, indirectly feeding back on microbial N-cycling diversity.

## 5. Temporal Dynamics

| Time Frame | Representative Evidence | Key Finding |
|------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **< 5 yr** | Great Plains clipping | Functional genes respond rapidly (<3 yr); richness relatively inert. |
| **5–10 yr** | SOERE PRO-EFELE | β-diversity diverges while α-diversity stable; manure > digestate for biomass. |
| **10–30 yr** | Grazing exclusion (11–26 yr window) | Peak C and functional gene richness. |
| **> 30 yr** | 36-yr exclusion | Declines in C stocks and altered aggregate-scale microbiomes. |

Temporal non-linearity cautions against extrapolating short-term trials to long-term policy.

## 6. Functional vs. Taxonomic Outcomes

**Captured Metagenomics (Lund Univ.)**  
• Soil N concentration dictates functional gene profile, while soil C controls taxonomic makeup.  
• Functional and taxonomic diversities **uncorrelated**; organic farming retained higher AMF phylogenetic diversity without yield penalty.

**Wisconsin Prairie Study**  
• Functional genes retained despite taxonomic turnover, underlining redundancy.

Take-home: **Microbial richness metrics alone are insufficient**; functional gene assays are necessary to interpret ecosystem consequences of extensification.

---

## 7. Over-Arching Driver: The Dominance of Soil pH

Across multiple datasets (five-country transect, Norway-France-Italy transect, global synthesis), **soil pH consistently emerged as the strongest predictor of bacterial community structure and sometimes diversity**.  
• Extensification that *raises* pH in acidified systems (e.g., reducing ammonium-based fertilizer) often **increases** bacterial richness.  
• Conversely, if extensification reduces liming or increases organic acid inputs, pH may drop, potentially offsetting any diversity gains from lower N inputs.

## 8. Answer to the Focal Question

**Does grassland management extensification reduce soil microbial diversity?**  
**In general, no—but**:
1. **Bacteria**: Richness is typically *unchanged* or *slightly increased* under extensification, yet composition (β-diversity) shifts along climatic and edaphic gradients more than management intensity.
2. **Fungi**: Certain guilds (saprotrophs, AMF) often **increase in richness and/or relative abundance** when grazing or mowing pressure declines.
3. **Functional genes**: Responses are idiosyncratic; N-cycling genes may decline with lower N inputs, but C-degradation genes can increase with greater litter return.

Therefore, extensification does **not systematically reduce** microbial diversity; rather, it *re-shapes* microbial communities with net positive, neutral, or occasionally negative outcomes depending on region, pH trajectory, botanical shifts, and time scale.

## 9. Management & Policy Implications

1. **Monitor Soil pH Concurrently**: Because pH overrides management in many cases, extensification programs should include liming or buffer strategies where acidification risk is high.  
2. **Tailor Grazing to Thresholds**: Evidence from Chinese meadow steppe shows light grazing can enhance diversity, whereas heavy grazing is detrimental—support implementation of adaptive stocking rates tied to local N:P ratios and rainfall.  
3. **Prioritize Functional Indicators**: Policies relying solely on OTU richness may overlook functional resilience or vulnerability; incorporate gene-based assays into soil-health schemes (e.g., GeoChip, qPCR panels for N 2O, C-degradation genes).  
4. **Temporal Staging**: Long-term (≥30 yr) exclusion can backfire in some semiarid systems; periodic disturbance (e.g., rotational grazing) might sustain both biodiversity and C stocks.  
5. **Leverage Botanical Legumes Strategically**: Single-legume additions deliver large productivity gains with minimal microbial downside, whereas high-richness mixes give diminishing returns under warming climates.

## 10. Unresolved Questions & Suggested Research Directions

1. **Functional Redundancy vs. Ecosystem Process Rates**: High functional gene redundancy does not guarantee process stability under extreme climate events; manipulative experiments should couple metagenomics to in situ flux measurements.  
2. **Deep-Soil Microbiomes (>30 cm)**: Most extensification studies sample top 0–15 cm; deeper layers may hold larger C pools and respond differently.  
3. **Integration with Greenhouse-Gas Budgets**: Link microbial shifts to net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and N 2O/CH₄ fluxes to quantify climate feedbacks of extensification.  
4. **Machine-Learning Synthesis**: Use high-resolution soil, climatic, and management datasets to train models that predict microbial responses across global grasslands.

## 11. Responses to Follow-Up Questions

**Q1. Geographic Biomes of Interest**  
The synthesis explicitly compares temperate European pastures, North American tallgrass prairies, and semi-arid Asian steppe systems, with ancillary data from Mediterranean and subtropical Azores sites. Tropical savannas remain under-represented and are a research gap.

**Q2. Definitions**  
• Extensification = reductions in stocking rate, external NPK/pesticide inputs, or mowing frequency (Section 2).  
• Microbial diversity assessed at three tiers: taxonomic α and β diversity (16S/ITS metabarcoding) and functional gene diversity (shotgun metagenomics, functional arrays).  

**Q3. Temporal Segregation**  
Yes. The review disentangles short-term (<5 yr), medium (5–10 yr), and long-term (>10 yr, up to 36 yr) effects (Section 5). Temporal non-linearity is emphasized to avoid misinterpretation of early trends.
