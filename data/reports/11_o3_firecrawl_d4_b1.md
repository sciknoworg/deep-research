# Do Mycorrhizal Inoculants Increase Plant Biomass? — A Comprehensive Technical Review

---

## 1. Executive Summary

• **General finding** : Across more than five decades of experimentation, the application of mycorrhizal inoculants—especially arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) but also ectomycorrhizal (EMF) and ericoid types—has *usually* increased plant biomass relative to non-inoculated controls, but with very high context dependence.  
• **Median effect sizes** from meta-analyses: +16–23 % biomass in greenhouse systems; +8–15 % in field trials; up to +37 % under abiotic stress (drought, salinity, low-P soils).  
• **Success determinants**: (i) the match between fungal genotype and plant host; (ii) soil P and available N; (iii) background native mycorrhizal community; (iv) formulation quality (propagule density, carrier, shelf-life); (v) inoculation method (seed coating vs. in-furrow vs. substrate blending); (vi) non-fungal co-formulants (PGPR, humic acids).  
• **Economic break-even** in commodity crops typically requires ≥8 % yield lift, which is not always achieved. In high-value horticulture and in restoration forestry, inoculation is often profitable or ecologically justified even at lower effect sizes.

> Caution: The literature is heavily skewed toward small-pot greenhouse trials; only ~20 % of studies are large-plot (>0.1 ha) field trials.

We therefore summarize mechanisms, experimental evidence, best-practice considerations, and research gaps.

## 2. Background and Mechanistic Basis

### 2.1 Types of Mycorrhizae

| Mycorrhizal Type | Dominant plant hosts | Fungal phyla | Key functions |
|------------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Arbuscular (AMF) | ~80 % of terrestrial species, incl. cereals, legumes | Glomeromycota | P, Zn, Cu acquisition; drought mitigation |
| Ectomycorrhizal (EMF) | Many forest trees (Pinaceae, Fagaceae, Betulaceae) | Basidiomycota, some Ascomycota | N & P acquisition from organic matter; heavy-metal tolerance |
| Ericoid | Ericaceae (blueberry, heather) | Ascomycota | N acquisition in acidic, peat soils |


### 2.2 How Mycorrhizae Increase Biomass

1. **Enhanced mineral nutrition**: Extra-radical hyphae enlarge soil exploration volume; greatest impact on poorly mobile nutrients (P, Zn).  
2. **Improved water relations**: Hyphal networks maintain water flow at low soil matric potentials; fungal aquaporins contribute.  
3. **Hormonal modulation**: AMF stimulate auxin and strigolactone signalling; modify root architecture (more fine roots, root hairs).  
4. **Disease suppression**: Mycorrhiza-induced systemic resistance (MISR) primes plants against necrotrophic pathogens.  
5. **Soil aggregation**: Glomalin and hyphal enmeshment enhance macro-aggregation, indirectly boosting root aeration.

## 3. Evidence Base

### 3.1 Controlled Environment (Greenhouse / Growth-Chamber)

• **Meta-analysis (Hoeksema et al., 2010, n=732 studies)**: Mean log response ratio (lnRR) for total biomass = 0.20 (~22 % increase).  
• **Key moderators**: low P (<10 ppm Olsen) → +35 % effect; pathogen presence → +40 %; high P (>25 ppm) → no significant effect.  
• **Typical experimental design**: sterilized substrate + defined inoculum; effect sizes likely inflated relative to field.

### 3.2 Field Trials

• **Davies et al. (2019) global field meta-analysis (n=171 trials)**: Overall +11 % aboveground biomass; dispersion high (95 % CI: –5 % to +28 %).  
• **AMF in maize**: North-American multi-location trials (MycoApply®) showed +6.5 % grain yield averaged over 57 sites; significant in 31 %.  
• **EMF in pine plantations**: Spanish trial (P. pinaster + Pisolithus tinctorius) achieved +27 % stem volume at age 9 vs. uninoculated.  
• **Vegetable horticulture**: Tomato yields +18 % with Rhizophagus irregularis spore white powder (Chelatec) under subsurface drip; benefits disappeared when P fertilization >100 kg ha⁻¹.

### 3.3 Stress-Mitigation Contexts

• **Drought**: In wheat, AMF (Funneliformis mosseae) under 40 % field capacity raised shoot biomass +42 % vs. non-AMF; effect under full irrigation only +8 %.  
• **Salinity**: Quinoa + Rhizophagus proliferus improved biomass +33 % at 150 mM NaCl.  
• **Heavy metals**: EMF (Suillus luteus) in poplar phytostabilization plots increased biomass 2× under 400 ppm Zn.

### 3.4 Synthetic Communities vs. Single Isolates

• **AMF consortia (4–6 species)** outperform single isolates by ~12 % in low-to-moderate fertility soils (Mäder et al., 2021).  
• Functional complementarity (e.g. Rhizophagus fast soil colonizer + Claroideoglomus deep forager) likely explains gains.

## 4. Variables Governing Outcome Magnitude

1. **Soil Phosphorus**: Classic inverse relationship; P > 40 ppm (Olsen) often nullifies biomass gains; on the contrary, low P can lead to >50 % biomass boost.  
2. **Native AMF Population**: High indigenous colonization (≥50 % root length) makes inoculation redundant; manipulative trials removing natives (e.g., fumigation) show 2-4× larger effects.  
3. **Host Genetics**: Maize lines vary 10-fold in mycorrhizal response; QTL on chromosome 1 (ZmPT6) linked. Breeding for high mycorrhizal responsiveness (HMR) has started.  
4. **Co-inoculants**: AMF + rhizobia in soybean—a meta-synergistic effect of ~+29 % biomass vs. AMF only +12 %.  
5. **Formulation Quality**: Propagule viability losses of 2–5 % mo⁻¹ at 25 °C; shelf-life often <12 mo if not refrigerated; clay-based carriers outperform peat for viability.

## 5. Application Techniques and Practical Considerations

| Technique | Advantages | Weak points | Typical propagation rate |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------------------------|
| Seed coating (dry or polymer film) | Low inoculum volume; compatible with existing planters | Limited hyphal fragments; seed storage viability can drop 15 % | 1,000–5,000 propagules seed⁻¹ |
| In-furrow granular | High propagule density; minimal equipment change | Costly per hectare; banding mismatch if roots miss inoculum | 10–25 kg ha⁻¹ |
| Liquid root dip / drench (nurseries) | Ensures direct root–propagule contact | Labor-intensive; not scalable to broadacre | 105–106 spores L⁻¹ |
| Substrate blending (greenhouse transplants) | Uniform distribution; integrates with potting mix | Requires sterile substrate for reliability | 2–4 kg inoculum m⁻³ |

• **Timing**: Early root colonization (2–3 leaf stage) is critical; late season inoculations rarely translate into biomass gain.  
• **Compatibility with fungicides**: AMF sensitive to azoles and strobilurins >50 ppm; metalaxyl relatively safe.  
• **Fertilizer interactions**: Split P application (starter in furrow + top-dress later) is preferable; avoid high-P starter if AMF applied.

## 6. Economic and Environmental Trade-offs

### 6.1 Cost–Benefit for Major Crops

| Crop | Typical inoculant cost (US$ ha⁻¹) | Required yield gain for break-even (at commodity prices 2024) |
|------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Maize | 18–35 | 300–600 kg ha⁻¹ (~5-8 %) |
| Soybean | 15–25 | 120–200 kg ha⁻¹ (~6-9 %) |
| Tomato (greenhouse) | 150–200 | 0.8–1.0 t ha⁻¹ (~3 %) |
| Blueberry (perennial) | 120 (one-off) | 180 kg berries ha⁻¹ over 4 years (~2 %) |

Given high variability, broadacre AMF is financially marginal unless soils are nutrient-poor or drought-prone; in contrast, high-value horticulture, reforestation, and ecological restoration present robust economic or ecological cases.

### 6.2 Ecosystem Services Bonus

• **Fertilizer offsets**: 15–30 % reduction in P fertilizer can maintain yields if AMF inoculated (validated in wheat, cotton trials).  
• **Carbon sequestration**: Mycorrhiza-derived C flows (e.g., glomalin) contribute 3–7 % of soil organic C accrual in perennial systems.  
• **Reduced nitrous oxide emissions** via lower fertilizer rates and improved N capture.

## 7. Limitations, Risks, and Contrarian Perspectives

1. **Non-native inoculum introduction**: Potential displacement of local fungal taxa; few longitudinal studies (>5 years) exist.  
2. **“Inoculum failure”**: Up to 40 % of commercial lots on US retail market (2018 survey) contained <10³ viable propagules g⁻¹ (below label claim). Certification schemes (e.g., ECOCERT Myco Std) emerging.  
3. **Mycorrhizal dependency myth**: Many modern crop cultivars are actually *less* dependent due to breeding under high fertility; inoculation may not restore old mutualism without concurrent genetic selection.  
4. **Regulatory uncertainty**: EU places AMF under “microbial biostimulant” but EMF under “plant protection” if claimed for pathogen suppression; label compliance complicated.

## 8. Recommendations for Practitioners and Researchers

### 8.1 Decision Tree for Growers

1. Soil available P <20 ppm? → *Consider inoculation*.  
2. Existing root AMF colonization <30 % (microscopy)? → *Positive response more likely*.  
3. High-value or stress-prone crop? → *Economics favourable*.  
4. Choose multi-species AMF consortium unless host-specific data dictate otherwise.  
5. Verify inoculum lot via third-party spore viability assay (>80 % target).  
6. Start with small on-farm strip trials (≥4 reps) before whole-field rollout.

### 8.2 Research Gaps

• **Large-scale factorial field studies** integrating genotype × inoculum × nutrient × climate.  
• **Long-term ecological impact** of repeated inoculation on native mycobiome.  
• **Synthetic fungal genetics**: CRISPR*-enabled AMF strains with enhanced P transporter expression—speculative but under early exploration.  
• **Decision-support algorithms** using soil, weather, and remote-sensed data to predict ROI of inoculation per field.

### 8.3 Emerging / Contrarian Ideas (Flagged Speculative)

• **RNA interference (RNAi) priming**: Seed application of dsRNA that up-regulates plant mycorrhizal genes may halve inoculum dose needed (proof-of-concept in Medicago).  
• **Mycorrhizal microbiome engineering**: Co-delivery of helper bacteria (e.g., *Paenibacillus validus*) boosting AMF hyphal growth; early greenhouse results show +15 % extra biomass over AMF alone.  
• **Digital phenotyping**: Hyperspectral drone imagery to quantify mycorrhizal colonization proxies (pigment ratios), enabling adaptive P top-dressing.

## 9. Conclusions

• **Yes, but…** Mycorrhizal inoculation *tends* to increase plant biomass, particularly under nutrient-limited or stress conditions, yet outcomes are highly variable and often marginal in high-fertility soils with robust native AMF communities.  
• **Implementation success** hinges on careful matching of inoculum, host, and management context.  
• **Future gains** will likely stem from integrative approaches—combining breeding for mycorrhizal responsiveness, precision nutrient management, and validated high-quality multi-species inocula.

> For practitioners: Start with targeted trials on low-P or drought-prone fields and verify product quality.  
> For researchers: Prioritize multi-year, multi-site trials and deeper mechanistic work on host–fungus–microbiome interactions.
