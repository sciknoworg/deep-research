# Does Mycorrhizal Inoculation Increase Plant Biomass?  
**A synthesized technical review and decision framework**  
2025-06-02  
  
---  
## 1. Objective & Scope  
The user asked whether mycorrhizal inoculation (MI) increases plant biomass. The follow-up scoping questions (plant group, mycorrhizal type, experimental context) were left unanswered; therefore this report treats the evidence base exhaustively and then provides a decision matrix that can be narrowed once those parameters are specified.  
  
Sources: 115 peer-reviewed inoculation studies (435 experiments) compiled in a 2016 quantitative meta-analysis, plus a suite of field audits, species-level pot trials, global surveys of commercial products, and disturbance-gradient studies (details embedded in §2–§7).  
  
---  
## 2. Quantitative Signal: Meta-analytic Benchmarks  
### 2.1 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)  
• Across the 115-study dataset, AM inoculation raised **total crop biomass by a grand mean of 34.9 %**.  
• When a **single, host-matched AM species** was used, the gain rose to **41.2 %**, underscoring genotype × genotype specificity and contradicting the “one-size-fits-all” premise of many commercial consortia.  
  
### 2.2 Elevated CO₂ interactions  
A global meta-analysis contrasting AM and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbioses under +eCO₂ found:  
• Mean plant biomass increase **+26.2 %** under eCO₂ alone; partitioned as **+33.9 % in AM plants** vs **+20.6 % in ECM plants**.  
• ECM fungi invested disproportionately in their own mycelial biomass (+30 % vs +6.6 % for AMF), signalling divergent C-allocation and nutrient-dilution outcomes (mean foliar N −11.9 %, P −12.0 %).  
  
### 2.3 Nutrient-addition interactions  
Fertilizer additions suppress native mycorrhizal abundance: −15 % (N) and −32 % (P). Thus MI benefits are likely curtailed under conventional high-P fertilization, but may resurrect under low-input or organic systems.

## 3. Host Plant Specificity & Functional Group Responses  
### 3.1 Cereals and other grasses  
• Sterile pot culture: **Switchgrass** shoot biomass jumped 1.1 → 5.0 g (12 wk, pH 6.5, *Glomus intraradices*).  
• In maize, only 3 of 12 audited products improved shoot biomass after 6 wk; label-recommended rates frequently failed.  
• Field wheat: commercial AM raised root colonisation and P uptake ≤30 %, yet **no above-ground biomass gain**—showing that colonisation ≠ productivity under non-limiting fertility.  
  
### 3.2 Legumes  
• *Berseem clover* fixed 1236 g C m⁻² under sterile AM pot culture, indicating strong C sequestration potential when AM connections are intact.  
• *Pterocarpus soyauxii* (Cameroon) responded with large positive MI effects in degraded low-P forest soils, doubled nodulation and lowered root:shoot ratio.  
  
### 3.3 Woody Perennials  
• Hydroponic *Quercus brantii* seedlings inoculated with ECM species showed **2.5–4.4× foliar P uptake** and developed classic short, thick ECM rootlets.  
• Low-inoculum rainforest soils: MI accelerated establishment of *Terminalia superba*, *Distemonanthus benthamianus*, *Entandrophragma utile*.  
• *Lophira alata* sometimes displayed neutral or negative MI effects despite biomass gain, illustrating that colonisation metrics alone can be misleading.  
  
### 3.4 Forage Grasses  
*Tropical grasses* (*Panicum coloratum*, *Brachiaria brizantha*) out-yielded temperate counterparts under AM inoculation, consistent with native co-evolutionary histories.

## 4. Inoculum Formulation & Quality Control  
### 4.1 Audit of Commercial Inoculants  
• 12 marketed products: 5 undeclared AMF species detected; 4 declared species never sporulated. Only 3 products marginally improved maize biomass.  
• Global multi-site survey of 28 products: **84 % contained no viable propagules** when plated on sterilized soil; 1/25 treatments increased biomass in non-sterile pots.  
• Hidden risk: one “sterile” prairie inoculant harboured the root pathogen *Olpidium brassicae*.  
  
### 4.2 Dose–response  
Field trial with native AM material (0–8192 kg ha⁻¹) showed that manufacturer-recommended dose was ineffective; biomass benefits scaled only at ≥10× rates.  
  
### 4.3 Single-species vs Consortia  
Meta-analysis: single species > mixtures (41.2 % vs 34.9 % biomass gain). Hypothesis: inter-fungal competition and host preference dilution in consortia.  
  
### 4.4 Regulatory Gap  
Evidence supports **mandatory potency/identity standards**, akin to Rhizobium inoculant regulations. Suggested: qPCR/barcoding certificates, spore viability thresholds, pathogen screening.

## 5. Environmental Context & Conditionality  
### 5.1 Soil Fertility  
• High-P regimes suppress mycorrhizal colonisation; MI pay-off greatest in P-limited or disturbed soils where indigenous inoculum < 10–20 % colonisation.  
### 5.2 Disturbance Gradients  
• Skid trails and log landings (low inoculum) showed strong MI benefit; agricultural/fallow soils (higher indigenous inoculum) exhibited neutral/negative responses.  
### 5.3 eCO₂ Futures  
• Rising atmospheric CO₂ likely raises mycorrhizal demand for nutrients; AM hosts could benefit more than ECM hosts, but foliar nutrient dilution must be countered.  
### 5.4 Biome Differences  
• Tropical systems: greater positive MI for fast-growing pioneer trees and C₄ grasses.  
• Temperate grasslands/golf greens: commercial products often underperform relative to native soil inoculum.  
  
---  
## 6. Controlled vs Field Performance  
### 6.1 Sterile/Greenhouse Trials  
• Consistent positive biomass responses (up to 4–5×) because background inoculum = 0 and nutrient competition absent.  
### 6.2 Non-sterile Field Trials  
• Outcomes mixed to negligible unless soils are biologically depauperate or fertility limiting. Practical implication: pre-screen field soil for existing colonisation % before investing in MI.

## 7. Mechanistic Insights  
1. **P acquisition**: Both AM & ECM expand soil exploration zone; ECM also mobilize organic P via phosphatases.  
2. **Carbon cost**: AM ~4–20 % of host photosynthate; under eCO₂, extra carbohydrate supply can relax trade-off.  
3. **Stress alleviation**: Mycelial nets improve drought resistance and pathogen tolerance, though biomass gains may be indirect.  
4. **Host specificity**: Receptor-ligand signalling dictates compatibility; hence single-strain “precision inoculants” look promising.  
  
---  
## 8. Deployment Recommendations (Preliminary)  
1. **Diagnose**: Quantify baseline root colonisation (%) and soil P (Olsen or Bray). Target MI when colonisation <10 % and P <10–15 mg kg⁻¹.  
2. **Select**: Prefer single, host-matched strains with barcoded identity; avoid unverified consortia.  
3. **Formulate**: Opt for granular or encapsulated spores allowing ≥100 viable propagules per seedling.  
4. **Apply**: Band-placement near seed/roots; consider higher-than-label rates (5–10×) if field heterogeneity high.  
5. **Monitor**: Re-sample colonisation at mid-season; measure biomass proxies (NDVI, LAI). Adjust fertilization to prevent P oversupply.  
6. **Regulate**: Advocate for spore-count and contaminant standards in procurement contracts.  
  
---  
## 9. Future Research & Emerging Technologies  
• **Designer AM symbionts**: CRISPR-assisted mutagenesis to enhance P transporter expression (speculative, regulatory hurdles flagged).  
• **RNA-guided host priming**: Seed coatings with miRNA mimics that amplify mycorrhizal signalling.  
• **In-field qPCR sensors** for real-time colonisation diagnostics.  
• **Microbiome co-inoculation**: pairing AMF with phosphate-solubilising bacteria to synergize P release.  
• **Bioreactor mass-culture of obligate AMF**: liquid‐state fermentation scaling to metric-ton quantities at viable cost—pilot plants in EU 2024 (speculative).

## 10. Decision Framework (to be refined once scoping answers provided)  
| Criterion | High probability of biomass gain | Low/Negligible gain | Actions |  
|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|---------|  
| Soil P | <10 mg kg⁻¹ | >20 mg kg⁻¹ | Adjust P fertilization; consider MI only if low |  
| Indigenous colonisation | <10 % | >30 % | Proceed with MI; else skip |  
| Host match | Native/selected strain | Generic consortium | Invest in strain screening |  
| Inoculum viability | Certified viable | Unverified | Demand lab certificate |  
| Environment | Organic/low-input, eCO₂, drought-prone | Conventional high-input | Re-allocate budget |

## 11. Conclusions  
1. In controlled systems with negligible native inoculum, **mycorrhizal inoculation reliably increases plant biomass (grand mean ≈ 35–40 %)**.  
2. Real-world field efficacy is highly conditional—greatest where soils are P-limited, biologically depauperate, or recently disturbed.  
3. Product quality is a critical bottleneck: 70–85 % of commercial inoculants fail basic viability tests; host-matched single-species inocula outperform multi-species mixes.  
4. Fertilizer regimes, elevated CO₂, and biome context modulate outcomes, sometimes counteracting MI benefits.  
5. Implementation should follow a **diagnose-select-validate** paradigm with rigorous QC to capture potential yield or ecosystem benefits.
