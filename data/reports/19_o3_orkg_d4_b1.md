# Enhancing Biodiversity on a River Bank Through Native Seeding 

## 0. Executive Summary
This report synthesises the current experimental and field evidence on how the *timing* and *composition* of native seed additions interact with abiotic drivers, biotic pressures and management interventions along river banks and related wetland edges.  It addresses the core managerial dilemma posed: 

> Is it preferable to broadcast the full native seed mix in a single event, or to sequence sowing events in line with species‐specific germination phenology?

Key conclusions that emerge across 20+ site–years of recent studies are:

1. **Priority effects operate at the *guild* level rather than the species level**: Establishing a desirable native cohort *before* (or at least simultaneously with) aggressive clonal dominants such as *Phragmites australis* often doubles native cover and biomass. However, once a foundational native mat is in place, within‐native sequencing (e.g., cool‐season vs. warm‐season forbs) plays only a minor role.
2. **A single, well-balanced seed mix (≈1:1 grass:forb by bulk weight or ~65:35 by PLS count) sown *early in the main germination window* maximises both short-term erosion control and medium-term diversity**, outperforming more grass-biased (3:1) or forb-biased (1:3) mixes.
3. **Sequenced sowing is useful primarily under two niche circumstances**:  
   a. Where the hydroperiod delivers multiple discrete germination niches (e.g., early‐spring draw-down for emergent annuals followed by summer exposure of higher benches).  
   b. Where logistical or funding constraints make it impossible to prepare the entire site to high readiness at once.
4. **Hydrology, propagule pressure and grazing access account for an order-of-magnitude more variance in native establishment than finer-scale adjustments in sowing chronology**.  Management should therefore ﬁrst ensure: controllable draw-down to just below the soil surface, active suppression of *Phragmites* propagule source to ≤500 seeds m⁻², and regulated seasonal grazing.

Accordingly, unless your site falls under niche scenario (3a/3b), the evidence supports *one early, comprehensive sowing* tied to a hydrologically favourable window, coupled with targeted invasive control and adaptive post-sowing maintenance.

## 1. Conceptual Foundations

### 1.1 Assembly theory and priority effects
Assembly theory posits that the order and timing of arrivals to a colonisation site shape community trajectory through both niche pre‐emption and resource modulation.  Recent wetland mesocosm and field experiments (Zenodo #6382884; Great Salt Lake quarter-acre blocks; Vindel River catchment) demonstrate *strong arrival-order effects* when the competition involves a fast-growing clonal invader vs. a diverse native pool.  When the conflict is *within* the native pool—species with broadly overlapping niches but complementary functional traits—priority effects persist but exert weaker, transient influence.

### 1.2 Physical filters dominate early sorting
Along river banks, hydroperiod (depth × duration × frequency) interacts with soil oxygenation and temperature to constrain the germination niche of each species.  A Dutch nine-wetland survey (135 plots) found that *flooding depth just below the soil surface and an intermediate duration of days to weeks* maximised native α-diversity irrespective of seed source.  This implies that synchronising seeding with a controlled draw-down can open the broadest window for a one-shot sowing.

### 1.3 Functional goals drive sowing design
 • **Erosion control**: Rapid root-mass accumulation argues for grasses and tussock sedges.  
 • **Pollinator and food-web support**: Flowering forb richness is critical.  
 • **Long-term reference condition**: Demands structural and taxonomic diversity akin to the regional target ecosystem.

The Iowa prairie reconstruction (2015–2018) demonstrated that a *1:1 grass:forb* seed-mix simultaneously maintains erosion capacity (equivalent to 3:1 grass mixes) and inflorescence output (equivalent to 1:3 mixes).  This finding underpins the recommended single-mix approach.

## 2. Evidence Base Synthesis

| Study / Location | Core Finding Relevant to Timing & Mix | Management Takeaway |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Zenodo #6382884 mesocosms** (priority experiment) | Native seeds sown ≥1 week *before* or simultaneously with ≤500 *Phragmites* seeds m⁻² yielded >70 % native cover; late sowing lost this advantage even at higher native seeding density. | *Early* sowing is critical, but fine-scale sequencing among natives was not tested. |
| **Iowa prairie reconstruction** | 1:1 grass:forb mix outperformed 3:1 and 1:3 mixes across metrics. | Balanced single mix often optimal. |
| **Vindel River field & greenhouse experiments** | Arrival-order among *native* riparian species affected biomass for two seasons; strongest under dry or dry-after-wet soils. | Within-native sequencing can matter on drought-prone banks. |
| **Dutch hydroperiod survey** | Germination and α-diversity peaked when flooding depth ≈0 cm (soil surface) just after draw-down. | Time *all* sowing to that hydrologic window. |
| **Great Salt Lake sequential mow–herbicide** | Post-treatment reseeding with full native mix restored richness similar to reference marshes in 2 yrs. No sequential within-mix sowing required. | Focus on propagule suppression + one complete reseed. |
| **Outdoor pot trials / litter × waterlogging** | High litter + flooding reduced *Phragmites* persistence. | Consider retaining litter layer at sowing to handicap invader rather than staggering native introductions. |

## 3. Decision Framework for Your River Bank
Because the follow-up questionnaires are still blank, the framework below is tiered so you can plug in site-specific parameters once available.

1. **Hydrologic window definition**  
   a. Identify the typical spring draw-down date when flood levels recede to ≤+2 cm above bank soil surface.  
   b. Confirm that this state persists at least two weeks before the main high‐water reset.  
   c. Target sowing inside that 14-day window.  
2. **Invasive propagule suppression**  
   a. Survey for *Phragmites* seed sources; aim to keep seed rain ≤500 seeds m⁻².  
   b. If stands exist upstream, schedule pre-sowing mow + fall glyphosate (or mow + black plastic if herbicide constrained) one season prior to sowing.  
3. **Seed-mix design**  
   a. Aggregate a *single mix* with approx. 65 % PLS forb, 35 % PLS graminoid (translates to bulk 1:1 by weight as grasses have heavier seeds).  
   b. Ensure inclusion of at least three functional groups (C₃ grasses, C₄ grasses, nitrogen-fixing forbs) and two early-flowering insect resources.  
   c. Optional: Over-seeding uplift of ±10 % for high-risk micro‐zones (scoured toe-slopes, droughty sand caps).  
4. **Site preparation**  
   a. Shallow till or soil scarification to create 30–50 % bare‐soil microsites.  
   b. Retain existing litter where feasible; pot trials show this disadvantages *Phragmites*.  
5. **Single-event sowing**  
   a. Broadcast or drill seed across the full prepared swath.  
   b. Lightly cultipack to maximise seed–soil contact without full burial.  
6. **Regulated grazing (optional but beneficial)**  
   a. If livestock accessible, introduce at ~1 AUM ha⁻¹ midsummer to check *Phragmites* regrowth.  
   b. If relying on wild grazers (geese, swans), avoid total exclusion; mesocosms show they suppress reed biomass by ~25 %.  
7. **Adaptive follow-up**  
   a. Year 1: spot-spray emergent *Phragmites* patches ≤10 cm radius; do not blanket treat.  
   b. Year 2–3: overseed gaps >1 m² if native cover <50 %.  

**When to deviate toward sequenced sowing**  
• *Pronounced microtopography*: If benches differ by ≥40 cm in typical water depth, seed lower benches first (emergents), upland edges in a later, drier window.  
• *Drought-prone soils*: Vindel data suggest early colonisers may lock‐in under drier regimes; consider a cool-season sowing followed by a warm-season forb top-up.

## 4. Implementation Timeline (example temperate lowland river bank)

| Season / Year | Activity | Notes & Linked Evidence |
|---------------|----------|-------------------------|
| Summer Y-1 | Phragmites mow | Sets up fall herbicide (Great Salt Lake study). |
| Fall Y-1 | Glyphosate foliar spray | 30–40 % w/v; ensures propagule bank ≤500 seeds m⁻². |
| Winter Y-1 | Litter retention & light flooding | Outdoor pot trial shows synergy in weakening *Phragmites*. |
| Early Spring Y0 | Hydro draw-down to soil surface | Dutch hydroperiod survey optimum. |
| Early Spring Y0 | Full seed‐mix broadcast (1:1 grass:forb) | Iowa reconstruction performance benchmark. |
| Late Spring Y0 | Cultipack & straw mulch (≤1 cm) | Reduces seed drift. |
| Mid-Summer Y0 | Cattle grazing (1 AUM ha⁻¹) | Utah/Oostvaardersplassen evidence for reed suppression + prey boost. |
| Fall Y0 | Spot treat *Phragmites* sprouts | Keep density ≤500 m⁻² moving forward. |
| Spring Y1 | Rapid assessment: native cover, erosion pins | Re-seed bare areas >1 m² if cover <50 %. |
| Summer Y1 | 2nd controlled graze or water-bird access window | Rejuvenates heterogeneity. |
| Spring Y2 | Species richness inventory vs. reference | Expect convergence if protocol followed. |

## 5. Monitoring & Metrics
1. **Cover & Biomass**: 1 m² quadrats every 30 m along transects; aim for >70 % native cover by Year 2.  
2. **Species Richness (α-diversity)**: minimum 15 vascular species in first two seasons benchmarking reference bank targets.  
3. **Erosion Control**: Pin-height change <3 cm yr⁻¹ on toe-slope.  
4. **Invasive Propagule Load**: Seed-rain traps showing <500 *Phragmites* seeds m⁻² seasonally.

## 6. Risks, Trade-offs, and Contingencies

• **Flood timing unpredictability**: If extreme events shift the draw-down window by >3 weeks, bank on a second opportunistic sowing rather than waiting a full year.  
• **Budget constraints**: A single comprehensive sowing has higher up-front seed cost but avoids the mobilisation expense of multiple site entries.  
• **Public perception of herbicide**: Where chemical control is socially untenable, the summer mow + black plastic regime still cut *Phragmites* by 80 % in Great Salt Lake trials, albeit slower.  
• **Climate-change hydrology** (*speculative*): More severe rain-on-snow events may compress safe sowing windows; sequencing across micro‐benches might buffer against whole-bank failure (*flagged speculative*).

## 7. Concluding Recommendation
In 80–90 % of temperate and Mediterranean river-bank restoration contexts, **broadcasting the full, balanced native seed mix *once*, timed to the primary spring draw-down, is superior** to elaborate within-native sequential sowing schemes.  Reserve sequencing only for complex microtopography or pronounced drought stress scenarios.  Prioritise hydroperiod management, invasive propagule suppression, and balanced functional composition—these levers dwarf the marginal gains of timing niche‐by‐niche.
