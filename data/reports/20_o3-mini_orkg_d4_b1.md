# Final Report on the Effects of Green Roofs on Urban Insect Biodiversity

This report synthesizes extensive research findings on how green roof design features influence urban insect biodiversity. Drawing from empirical field experiments, comparative analyses, simulation studies, and intentional design interventions, this report provides an in‐depth review of substrate modifications, vegetation structure, microclimatic effects, and connectivity, all of which underpin arthropod community composition and functioning in urban settings.

## 1. Introduction

Urbanization typically leads to habitat fragmentation and the loss of biodiversity. Green roofs—vegetated roof systems installed atop buildings—offer a promising strategy to mitigate these effects by introducing secondary habitats into urban downtowns. The focus of current research has been to understand how roof design (e.g., substrate type and depth, vegetation composition, and added structural heterogeneity) influences urban insect populations. This report critically examines various studies from cities such as Zurich, Portland, Sydney, London, Basel, Geneva, and Boston, and elucidates how different parameters can either limit or promote various arthropod functional groups, such as pollinators, decomposers, predators, and other specialists.

## 2. Detailed Analyses and Core Findings

### 2.1. Substrate Composition and Moisture Dynamics

A major emphasis in the research has been on the effect of substrate modifications. Several experimental studies have underscored that:

- **Substrate Type Effects:** Comparisons between organic‐mineral mixtures and purely mineral substrates have revealed critical differences in water retention. For instance, Dymondia margaretae, a species used in some studies, shows notably higher water retention capacity. This phenomenon underlines how substrate composition can mediate microhabitat moisture, thus affecting insect arthropods differently depending on their hydration needs.

- **Hydrological Performance and Insect Habitat:** Research shows that substrate properties modulate hydrological functions such as stormwater retention and evapotranspiration. Runoff coefficients ranging from 0.59 to 0.71 have been documented depending on substrate types, with antecedent dry weather conditions influencing moisture availability across green roofs. The dynamics of moisture retention have downstream ecological implications, particularly by altering microclimatic conditions that are critical for insect activity and lifecycle processes.

- **Depth and Thermal Regulation:** Simulation studies further illustrate that while thicker substrates (e.g., >10–12 cm) can reduce temperatures by up to 14.6°C through latent heat cooling, the benefits plateau beyond a certain depth. This law of diminishing returns is crucial when designing substrates aimed at maximizing insect-friendly microhabitats.

### 2.2. Vegetation Structure and Habitat Complexity

A recurrent theme across studies is the role of vegetation in shaping arthropod communities:

- **Species Richness and Plant Composition:** Local vegetation attributes—such as overall plant species richness, percent cover, and the relative abundance of forbs, grasses, and annuals (as opposed to monocultures of Sedum)—are positively correlated with higher arthropod diversity. In cities like Zurich and regions with Mediterranean or subtropical climates, studies have conclusively shown that increased vegetation complexity leads to enhanced niche differentiation across arthropod communities.

- **Structural Heterogeneity:** The intentional inclusion of diverse plant species and structural elements (such as logs, pebbles, or pebble piles) creates distinct microhabitats. Experimental modifications (e.g., substrate redistribution) can alter microsite temperature and moisture regimes, potentially favoring specialist species over generalists. This design complexity not only aids in recruitment but can also support a more balanced trophic structure among urban insects, thereby increasing functional diversity.

- **Corridors and Connectivity:** Moreover, green roofs can serve as biodiversity corridors by connecting isolated urban green spaces. The design adaptations that promote connectivity also facilitate the movement and gene flow of insects, particularly those with limited dispersal abilities. This underlying mechanism is critical from an urban ecological perspective and is relevant to future designs aiming to improve overall urban connectivity.

### 2.3. Microclimatic Influences and Functional Group Responses

In addition to substrate and vegetation factors, microclimatic conditions have emerged as a central theme in modulating arthropod diversity:

- **Temperature and Moisture Gradients:** Microclimatic assessments indicate that substrate composition and plant cover significantly modulate local temperature and moisture gradients. Several studies have reported that, while ground-level sites typically exhibit higher overall species richness, the specialized microhabitats created on green roofs may support higher functional diversity among niche groups—especially among specialist pollinators such as Apidae, hoverflies, and parasitoid wasps.

- **Trait Assemblages Among Urban Insects:** By focusing on both overall diversity metrics and specific functional groups, numerous studies have found that targeted green roof designs can shift the balance between specialist and generalist traits. For example, roofs with distinct habitats can lead to disproportionately high representation of functional groups that are sensitive to microhabitat variability.

- **Environmental Mechanisms:** Beyond direct observations, simulation models indicate that design interventions which modulate latent cooling and water retention are directly related to shifts in arthropod community composition. These mechanistic links echo through the urban ecosystem, underscoring that even subtle microclimatic variations may influence the relative success of different arthropod groups.

## 3. Synthesis of Causal Mechanisms and Practical Implications

### 3.1. Integrated Design Strategy

The evidence suggests that a holistic design-oriented approach is paramount to maximize the ecological benefits of green roofs. Integrated strategies should consider the following elements:

- **Substrate Selection and Management:** Optimize moisture retention and thermal regulation through the use of organic‐mineral mixed substrates. Adjust substrate depth carefully to balance water retention and cooling benefits while avoiding diminishing returns in latent heat effects.

- **Vegetation Diversity and Structural Additions:** Enhance plant species richness and structural complexity. Design guidelines should encourage the incorporation of a wide spectrum of plant types (including forbs, grasses, and occasional annual plantings) that promote various microhabitats. The intentional addition of logs, pebble piles, or other structural elements can further modify microsite conditions to favor specialist arthropods.

- **Connectivity and Urban Integration:** Develop design protocols that foster connectivity with other urban green spaces. In doing so, green roofs do not function as isolated islands but as integral components of urban ecological networks, promoting dispersal and genetic diversity.

### 3.2. Causality Versus Correlation

It is also important to recognize that while observational correlations between green roof modifications and increased insect biodiversity are robust, attempts to delineate explicit causal mechanisms remain ongoing. Most research points toward well-supported hypotheses regarding

- The role of substrate-modulated microclimatic conditions on insect hydration and habitat suitability.
- The influence of vegetation diversity on resource availability and shelter provision, which directly affects insect colonization and survival.
- The capacity of intentional design complexity in fostering both overall and functional diversity by creating niche microhabitats.

Future experimental designs should incorporate controlled manipulations (e.g., substrate redistribution experiments) to further isolate these causal links and quantify their relative contributions.

### 3.3. Contrarian and Emerging Perspectives

In addition to conventional design wisdom, emerging research suggests several innovative avenues:

- **Smart Substrate Materials:** The development of adaptive substrates that can alter their moisture retention properties in response to environmental conditions may dynamically optimize microhabitats for insect communities.

- **Integrative Ecological Modelling:** Using integrative simulation models that combine hydrological, thermal, and ecological components could forecast how nuanced design changes will affect specific target functional groups. This predictive capacity would be especially valuable in designing green roofs tailored to support vulnerable insect populations.

- **Behavioral Ecology Approaches:** Investigating the behavioral responses and dispersal mechanisms of urban insects in response to green roof designs could inform adaptive management strategies, ensuring that design parameters evolve in line with ecological outcomes.

## 4. Discussion and Future Directions

The collective body of research indicates that green roofs offer a viable and scalable intervention to enhance urban insect biodiversity. However, the successful translation of these findings into urban policy and design requires close collaboration among ecologists, urban planners, architects, and policy-makers. Key considerations for future work include:

- **Standardization of Metrics:** There is a need to standardize methods for assessing both overall species richness and functional diversity. This standardization would allow for comparative analyses across studies and urban contexts.

- **Longitudinal Studies:** Continued long-term monitoring is essential to capture temporal shifts in arthropod communities as green roof ecosystems mature and undergo successional changes.

- **Scaling Up and Policy Integration:** Given the variability in urban settings (e.g., differences in local climate, building architecture, and existing green space connectivity), scalable guidelines that incorporate regional specifics are required. Moreover, the incorporation of green roofs into broader urban planning strategies could enhance biodiversity while also addressing urban heat island effects and stormwater management challenges.

- **Interdisciplinary Research:** A strong case exists for combining expertise in material science, botany, and entomology to develop new technologies—such as smart substrates—and to monitor their ecological impacts in real time.

## 5. Conclusion

Green roofs, when purposefully designed, represent a multifaceted solution for enhancing urban insect biodiversity. The interplay between substrate properties, vegetation complexity, microclimatic dynamics, and connectivity is critical to fostering diverse arthropod communities in urban environments. The convergence of observational studies, experimental modifications, and simulation models provides compelling evidence of the ecological benefits linked to tailored green roof designs. Further research that incorporates innovative materials and long-term monitoring will be crucial for optimizing these systems as integral components of sustainable urban ecosystems.
