# Global Biodiversity at an Inflection Point – Key Challenges, Systemic Blockers & Emerging Solutions 

*Prepared 5 June 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

Global biodiversity is in free-fall: the **WWF Living Planet Index (LPI 2024)** reports a **73 % mean decline in monitored vertebrate populations since 1970**, with freshwater systems plunging 85 %. The **IPBES Global Assessment** warns that **~1 million species face extinction** in coming decades. Five proximate drivers—land/sea-use change, direct exploitation, climate change, pollution, invasive species—interact with economic and governance mega-drivers such as perverse subsidies, weak fiscal alignment, trade tele-couplings, and insufficient financing. Meanwhile, momentum is growing around nature-positive finance, green budgeting, and biodiversity credit markets, yet these remain orders of magnitude below need. This report synthesises the latest evidence (including IPBES-11, Kunming–Montreal GBF, UNEP 2023 subsidy figures, EU/French budget pilots, and WEF/McKinsey biodiversity-credit work) to map challenges, quantify gaps, and outline actionable solutions.

Key take-aways:

1. **We are overshooting Earth’s ecological carrying capacity**: unpriced externalities from food, energy and fisheries already reach **US$10-25 trn yr⁻¹**.
2. **Public money is still nature-negative**: **US$1.7 trn yr⁻¹** in harmful subsidies (agri-chemicals, fossil fuels, fisheries, forestry) dwarfs positive spend.
3. **Policy alignment is lagging**: only 16 % of land and 8 % of ocean enjoy some protection; fewer than a dozen jurisdictions have begun full green-budget tagging.
4. **Finance gap**: GBF Goal D pegs the biodiversity-finance shortfall at **US$700 bn yr⁻¹**; Parties must mobilise **US$200 bn yr⁻¹** and repurpose **≥ US$500 bn yr⁻¹** in incentives by 2025.
5. **Delay is costly**: IPBES insists a 10-year wait doubles restoration costs and adds **≥ US$0.5 trn yr⁻¹** in climate damages.

Advanced tools—green budget tagging, subsidy “swap” programmes, high-integrity biodiversity credits, and nature-based solutions—could close the gap and unlock **US$10 trn** in new value plus **395 million jobs** by 2030.

## 1  State of Biodiversity: Status & Trends

### 1.1 Global Indicators

| Indicator | Latest Value | Trend (since 1970) |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------|
| WWF Living Planet Index (global) | –73 % | ↓ accelerating |
| Freshwater subset | –85 % | Catastrophic |
| Terrestrial subset | –69 % | Severe |
| Marine subset | –56 % | High decline |
| Red-listed species threatened | ~1 million | Rising |

Regional collapse is most acute in **Latin America & Caribbean (–95 %)** and **Africa (–76 %)**.

### 1.2 Economic Dependence on Nature

IPBES-11 Nexus Assessment calculates that **> 50 % of global GDP (≈ US$58 trn yr⁻¹)** is moderately to highly dependent on nature, exposing the macro-economy to rising ecological risk.

## 2  Proximate Drivers of Biodiversity Loss

### 2.1 Land- and Sea-Use Change (Dominant Driver)

• Agriculture expansion, deforestation, rangeland conversion, coastal reclamation.
• Tele-coupled commodity chains (soy, palm, beef, seafood) externalise impacts to producer regions.

### 2.2 Direct Exploitation of Organisms

• Overfishing (illegal, unreported and unregulated catches) backed by **US$35-54 bn yr⁻¹** in capacity-enhancing subsidies.
• Illegal wildlife trade still worth **US$7-23 bn yr⁻¹**.

### 2.3 Climate Change

• 1.2 °C warming already shifting ranges and phenology; IPBES projects climate to overtake direct exploitation by 2050 under >2 °C scenarios.
• Adds **≈ US$0.5 trn yr⁻¹** in extra costs if action delayed 10 years.

### 2.4 Pollution

• Agrochemical runoff drives eutrophication; plastic pollution found in all ocean basins.
• Emerging contaminants (PFAS, pharmaceuticals, nanoplastics) under-regulated.

### 2.5 Invasive Alien Species

• Now implicated in 60 % of recorded plant & animal extinctions.
• Annual economic damage estimated at **US$423 bn** (IPBES IAS Assessment 2024).

## 3  Systemic Economic & Governance Drivers

### 3.1 Perverse Subsidies & Fiscal Mis-alignment

• **UNEP 2023**: **US$1.7 trn yr⁻¹** nature-negative public support.
  – Fossil-fuel subsidies surged to **US$1.16 trn in 2022**.
  – Agriculture, fisheries & forestry add ≥ **US$540 bn yr⁻¹**.
• *Swap potential*: redirecting just 30 % could finance GBF Targets 18-19.

### 3.2 Budget Tagging & Classification Gaps

Preferred schemes:
• **I4CE 5-colour scale** (dark-green → brown)
• **EU Taxonomy**

No jurisdiction has yet piloted systematic tagging of **brown/unfavourable** line items—an **unresolved gap** likely to take 5 years to close.

Case studies:
• **Essonne (France)**: 100 % of 470+ budget lines screened; “unclassified” spend cut from 40 % (2023) to 5 % (2025).
• **Normandy**: €2.13 bn FY-2025 budget screened via EU Taxonomy.
• **Next Generation Budgets Module 2 (Mar 2025)** trained jurisdictions incl. Baden-Württemberg, Hawai‘i, Catalonia.

### 3.3 Protected-Area Coverage & Effectiveness

• Global coverage: 16 % land, 8 % ocean—far from GBF “30×30”.
• Many PAs are paper parks: <20 % have adequate management funding.

### 3.4 Financing Gap

• **GBF Goal D**: **US$700 bn yr⁻¹** gap.
• By 2025 parties must: mobilise **US$200 bn yr⁻¹** (Target 19) and identify/reform **≥ US$500 bn yr⁻¹** in harmful incentives (Target 18).

### 3.5 Governance & Equity Dimensions

• Indigenous peoples manage ~20 % of Earth’s land and 80 % of its biodiversity; yet tenure rights remain weak in many jurisdictions.
• Equity, benefit-sharing, and FPIC procedures still inconsistently applied.

## 4  Emerging Finance & Market Instruments

### 4.1 Subsidy Reform Tool-kits

• **BIOFIN 2024 “Nature of Subsidies” guide**
• **WTO 2022 Fisheries Subsidies Agreement** now under national ratification—early pilots coupling reform with budget reallocations.

### 4.2 Green Budget Tagging

• Rapid-scale entry point for governments; enables ex-ante alignment with GBF and EU climate-biodiversity disclosure mandates.
• Integration with digital public-finance systems (SAP S/4HANA, Treasury MIS) under exploration.

### 4.3 Voluntary Biodiversity-Credit Markets

• WEF/McKinsey (2023) demand projection: **US$0.76–2 bn** by 2030 → **US$6–69 bn** by 2050 under high-integrity scenario.
• Five corporate use-cases emerging: ecosystem-service security, green product bundling, carbon co-benefits, GBF contributions, residual impact compensation.
• Integrity prerequisites: robust reference baselines, MRV tech (eDNA, LiDAR, remote sensing), and harmonised claims guidance.

### 4.4 Nature-Based Solutions (NbS)

• Could deliver **37 % of cost-effective climate mitigation to 2030** and generate cross-sector co-benefits (flood control, health, jobs).
• Investment need: **US$200-300 bn yr⁻¹**; current flows < US$154 bn yr⁻¹.

## 6  Strategic Outlook 2025-2030

### 6.1 Business-as-Usual

• Biodiversity loss continues; cumulative GDP risk ≥ **US$2.7 trn by 2030**.
• Climate adaptation costs escalate; restoration bills double.

### 6.2 Timely Integrated Action (IPBES Transformative-Change Scenario)

• Unlock **US$10 trn** in new business opportunities and **395 million jobs** by 2030.
• Achieve net-positive biodiversity trajectories by 2035.

## 7  Recommendations for Expert Stakeholders

### 7.1 Governments

1. **Mandate full-spectrum green budget tagging** using I4CE 5-colour scale; incorporate brown-tagging by 2026.
2. **Phase out ≥ 30 % of harmful subsidies by 2027**, reallocating to NbS and Indigenous stewardship.
3. **Scale Ecological Fiscal Transfers** to sub-nationals; integrate performance metrics (e.g. Extinction Solutions Index).
4. **Align NDCs and National Biodiversity Strategies** through joint climate-nature budgeting.

### 7.2 Financial Institutions & Corporates

1. Adopt **TNFD-aligned disclosure** with double-materiality lens.
2. Pilot **biodiversity credit procurement** linked to verified NbS; co-bundle with carbon for price discovery.
3. Deploy **AI-driven biodiversity risk analytics** (eRNA, hyperspectral satellite) for portfolio screening.

### 7.3 Researchers & NGOs

1. Develop **open-source baselines** for biodiversity-credit registries (e.g., eDNA meta-barcoding libraries).
2. Advance **tele-coupling models** to trace hidden biodiversity impacts in trade flows.
3. Quantify **genomic adaptation costs** to inform assisted-evolution debates.

### 7.4 Indigenous Peoples & Local Communities (IPLCs)

1. Negotiate **sovereign‐to‐sovereign benefit-sharing agreements** for ecosystem services.
2. Integrate **biocultural indicators** into national monitoring frameworks.

## 8  Speculative Horizons (Flagged as Forward-Looking)

• **Planetary-scale Natural Capital Ledger** on blockchain enabling smart-contract subsidy swaps.
• **Gene-drive biocontrol** for invasive species (requires rigorous ethical oversight).
• **Digital Twin of the Biosphere** coupling real-time eDNA with Earth-system models for predictive policy stress-tests.

## 9  Concluding Remarks

The biodiversity crisis is no longer a purely ecological concern; it is a systemic economic and governance failure costing trillions annually. Yet the levers for change—subsidy reform, green budgeting, high-integrity credit markets, Indigenous stewardship, and science-based NbS—are now proven and ready to scale. The next five years will determine whether the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework becomes a turning-point or another missed opportunity. Integrated, fiscally aligned action can still bend the curve—unlocking massive socio-economic dividends while safeguarding the web of life.
