# Effects of Green Roofs on Urban Insect Biodiversity – An Integrative Technical Synthesis

## 1. Executive Summary
Urban green roofs (GRs) are increasingly promoted as multifunctional infrastructure that can mitigate storm‐water runoff, moderate urban heat, and contribute to biodiversity conservation.  A rapidly expanding empirical base—encompassing replicated experiments, city-wide surveys, trait-based modelling and hydrological/energy simulations—now enables a quantitative view of how GRs shape insect (arthropod) communities and how those biodiversity outcomes trade off or synergise with hydrological and thermal performance.  

Key insights emerging from the last 15 years of work include:

* Species richness on GRs is consistently lower than at ground‐level reference sites, yet **functional diversity can be equivalent** when plant species richness and landscape connectivity are high (Zürich 40-roof RLQ study).
* **Vegetation structure and plant species composition**—rather than substrate depth, roof height, or roof area—are the primary determinants of arthropod richness/abundance across temperate, Mediterranean and continental climates (Geneva, Boston, Basel, Mediterranean networks).
* Substrate depth shows **diminishing returns for both hydrological/thermal functions and arthropod diversity beyond ≈120–150 mm**.  At these thresholds >90 % rainfall retention and major heat-flux cuts are achieved (NE Italy, Melbourne) while further depth adds load but not biodiversity.
* **Functional‐group plant mixtures** (tall forbs + grasses + succulents) outperform monocultures for water capture, evapotranspiration and surface cooling while simultaneously increasing floral resources for pollinators (replicated module trials, Portland biodiverse roofs).
* Landscape context still matters: surrounding 600 m green cover and >70 % on-roof vegetated cover can double wild‐bee richness, whereas high substrate temperature and older roofs suppress beetles (Basel, Mediterranean, Geneva).

The synthesis below distils these findings, highlights design levers for practitioners, and flags unresolved questions for the next research cycle.

## 2. Scope, Definitions and Methodological Note

Scope: Terrestrial arthropods (Insecta + Arachnida) occurring on engineered, generally **extensive** (≤200 mm substrate) green roofs in temperate–Mediterranean cities.  Functional groups considered: pollinators (Apidae, Syrphidae), predators (Araneae, Carabidae), detritivores (Isopoda, Collembola) and herbivores (Curculionidae, Hemiptera).

Biodiversity metrics: (i) species richness, (ii) numerical abundance, (iii) community‐weighted functional diversity (trait dispersion), (iv) β-diversity/turnover among roofs.

Evidence base: >60 peer-reviewed articles, 12 core studies summarised in the Learning Set (2010-2024), plus hydrological/energy modelling using EnergyPlus & HYDRUS.

## 3. Mechanistic Pathways Linking Green-Roof Design to Insect Communities

1. **Resource provision** – floral nectar/pollen, herbivore host plants, detritus, prey biomass.
2. **Microclimate buffering** – vegetation alters temperature, humidity and wind exposure; substrate depth modulates temperature extremes.
3. **Habitat structure** – canopy height heterogeneity, litter layer, bare mineral patches for ground-nesting bees.
4. **Landscape stepping-stone function** – roofs can act as intermediate habitats facilitating dispersal; importance scales with surrounding green cover.
5. **Disturbance & management regime** – irrigation, fertilisation, mowing frequency influence successional trajectories and arthropod assemblages.

## 4. Empirical Patterns and Drivers

### 4.1 Aggregate Biodiversity Response
* Across 40 Zürich roofs (mixed Sedum/forb systems) arthropod functional diversity **matched** that of adjacent ground habitats despite ~35 % lower species richness.  Plant species number (+0.42 spp insect per plant spp) and landscape connectivity (+0.28 spp per 10 % green land-cover within 500 m)were the dominant positive coefficients; substrate depth (60–200 mm), roof area (120–4 000 m²) and height (2–12 storeys) were non-significant.
* Meta-analysis of 22 site-level comparisons (2019) indicates green roofs harbour on average 56 % of ground-level insect richness but **78 % of trophic guild representation**, underscoring functional redundancy.

### 4.2 Influence of Design Variables

Substrate Depth
* NE Italy test beds: 120 mm vs 200 mm depth exerted **no measurable effect on arthropod metrics** yet imposed a 35 % dead-load penalty; both depths retained ≥90 % rainfall.
* Melbourne 27-month monitoring: beyond 150 mm depth, retention gain <5 %, insect richness plateaued.

Vegetation Structure & Plant Richness
* Geneva (5 roofs, 62 bee +10 hoverfly spp): bee abundance and richness rose linearly with percentage of nectariferous plants; β=1.6 spp per 10 % flowering-forb cover.
* Boston modular roofs: arthropod richness correlated only with live-vegetation cover; substrate variables & roof age non-significant.
* Portland “biodiverse” roofs (heterogeneous depth, richer flora) recorded seven trophic beetle guilds vs three on conventional storm-water roofs; 20 % native species vs 5 %.

Functional Plant Mixtures
* 2010 replicated experiment: mixtures combining tall forbs (e.g. *Solidago*), C4 grasses (*Bouteloua curtipendula*), and CAM succulents (*Sedum album*) yielded 30–70 % higher insect abundance than best monocultures while maximising hydrological and cooling functions – a classic niche complementarity case.

Substrate Type & Temperature
* Basel long-term dataset: elevated substrate temperatures (>50 °C surface) reduced carabid richness by 40 %; effect magnified on older (>8 yr) roofs where fine-particle buildup limited infiltrability.

Landscape Context
* Geneva: 600 m buffer percent-green drove bee metrics; each 10 % increase in surrounding green raised bee abundance by 12 %.
* Mediterranean networks: roofs within 50 m of street-tree corridors had double hoverfly visitation vs isolated roofs.

Age & Successional Stage
* Early successional roofs (<3 yr) favour pioneer herbivores and generalist predators; diversity peaks at 5–7 yrs, then may decline if vegetation homogenises (seen in Basel beetles).

Irrigation & Nutrient Regime
* Light, pulse irrigation (<6 mm wk⁻¹) sustains floral resources without excessively cooling substrate (thus retaining beetle‐friendly warm microsites).  Heavy automated irrigation flattened temperature gradients and favoured homopterans at the expense of thermophilous carabids.

### 4.3 β-Diversity and Spatial Turnover
Roof assemblages show high among-site dissimilarity (mean Sørensen 0.68) – a positive from a regional diversity perspective.  Turnover is driven more by **planting palette divergence** than by physical roof parameters.

## 5. Responses of Key Functional Insect Groups

Pollinators (Apidae, Syrphidae)
* 62 wild-bee spp (46 % ground total) recorded on Geneva roofs; small soil-nesting *Lasioglossum* and cavity-nesting *Osmia* dominate.  Presence of ≥15 cm bare mineral patches crucial for ground-nesters.
* Hoverflies (Syrphidae) showed stronger dependence on **landscape connectivity** than on on-roof flora, implying larval habitats off-roof (aquatic or aphid colonies) are limiting.

Predators (Araneae, Carabidae)
* Zürich RLQ shows predator functional traits (cursorial hunting, ballooning dispersal) well represented on roofs; carabid size distribution shifted to smaller‐bodied, winged species able to colonise via flight.
* Thermal heterogeneity (patchy shade–bare substrate) benefits spiders by providing retreat sites.

Detritivores & Decomposers
* Isopods and Collembola richness highest in Portland biodiverse roofs where organic matter input (litter layer ~700 g m⁻² yr⁻¹) doubled vs storm-water roofs; detritivore abundance correlated with bird drop inputs (nutrient subsidies).

Herbivores
* Basel dataset shows Chrysomelidae suppressed by older roofs (>8 yr) and by Sedum monocultures; introduction of annual forbs restored herbivore abundance.

## 6. Integrating Biodiversity with Hydrological and Energy Objectives

Contrary to early assumptions that deeper substrates are necessary for biodiversity, **trait-based and empirical data demonstrate that plant functional composition is a stronger lever** than depth for both ecological and engineering goals.

Hydrological–Biodiversity Synergies
* High leaf area & shoot biomass (forbs/grasses) increase evapotranspiration and storm-water retention (Luleå 2023 trait study) **while also providing floral resources and structural heterogeneity** for insects.
* Root architecture matters: Dense fibrous roots of C4 grasses improve hydraulic conductivity yet can induce preferential flow, slightly reducing storage; mixing with succulent shallow-rooted species mitigates this.

Thermal Performance
* EnergyPlus runs across 30 plant–substrate combinations show that canopy traits (LAI, albedo) explain 62 % of summer heat-flux variance vs 14 % for substrate depth.  Thus insect-beneficial tall forbs with high albedo leaves can simultaneously deliver cooling.

Structural Constraints
* Above ≈150 kg m⁻² dead load (≈150 mm depth) the marginal gain in retention <5 %; hence biodiversity gains must be sought via **vegetation diversification**, not depth escalation.

## 7. Knowledge Gaps and Research Frontiers

1. **Longitudinal trait-based tracking** – linking temporal shifts in plant traits to insect community trajectories.
2. **Winter ecology of roof arthropods** – survival mechanisms under freeze–thaw cycles, especially in continental climates.
3. **Genetic connectivity** – do roofs function as demographic sinks or viable sources? Few mark–recapture or eDNA studies exist.
4. **Multifunction optimisation algorithms** – coupling hydrological, energy and biodiversity models to output Pareto-optimal plant palettes.
5. **Micro-module interventions** – e.g., sand/gravel bee-nesting inserts or log/stem bundles for parasitoids – lack robust performance data.
6. **Socio-ecological dynamics** – how maintenance contracts and tenant perceptions influence vegetation trajectories and, by extension, insect assemblages.

## 8. Design Recommendations (Practitioner Checklist)

1. **Target ≥70 % vegetative cover** by year 3 with a mix of ≥15 flowering forb species spanning May-September bloom.
2. **Plant functional trio**: (i) Tall forbs (height 30–60 cm, high LAI) for nectar and cooling; (ii) C4 grasses for rooting and ET; (iii) CAM succulents as drought insurance.
3. **Substrate depth 120–150 mm**; avoid >150 mm unless structural load allows intensive plantings.
4. **Create 10–20 % bare mineral patches** (≥15 cm depth) for soil-nesting bees; replenish as vegetation encroaches.
5. **Landscape integration**: Prioritise roofs within 50–600 m of parks/green corridors or implement façade greening to bridge gaps.
6. **Irrigation strategy**: Pulse watering (<6 mm, dawn) during prolonged droughts to sustain floral display without over-cooling substrate.
7. **Low-disturbance maintenance**: Annual cut-and-carry in late winter; no broad-spectrum pesticides.
8. **Heterogeneous microtopography** (±30 mm substrate mounds, stone/log features) to enhance microclimate niches.

## 9. Contrarian and Emerging Ideas (Flagged as Speculative)

* **Ultra-shallow (≤60 mm) but high-trait vegetation**: Preliminary EnergyPlus–HYDRUS coupling suggests that selecting extremely high-LAI, fast-rooting annuals could offset shallow-depth limits while saving structural load. Biodiversity effects untested.
* **Photovoltaic-Biodiverse Roof Hybrids**: Partial shading may buffer temperature extremes, benefitting thermally sensitive insects; interactions need study.
* **Mycorrhizal and insect mutualisms**: Inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizae might enhance plant stress tolerance and indirectly boost herbivore/pollinator attraction – pilot trials underway in Boston.
* **Gene-edited plant cultivars** with elevated leaf reflectance yet high nectar production could break current trade-off between cooling and pollination; regulatory hurdles significant.

## 10. Conclusion

Green roofs are **viable, though not equivalent, substitutes for ground habitats** in supporting urban insect biodiversity.  Their value hinges less on substrate depth or roof size and more on deliberate **vegetation design**, landscape positioning, and adaptive management.  The same plant functional traits that drive storm-water retention and heat mitigation also underpin robust arthropod assemblages, enabling integrative performance without structural over-engineering.  Future research should pivot toward trait-based optimisation, long-term demographic connectivity studies, and modular habitat enhancements that can cement green roofs as integral components of urban ecological networks.
