# Soil Biota–Plant Diversity Interactions in Calcareous Soils of Central Europe – State of Knowledge, Emerging Insights and Management Implications

*Prepared for an expert audience – June 2025*

---

## 1  Scope and Structure of this Report
This synthesis collates what is currently known about how the **entire soil‐biota continuum** – microbes to meso- and macro-fauna – regulates **vascular-plant diversity** in **calcareous (CaCO₃-rich) soils** of Central Europe (loosely: Alps to Baltic, Jura to Pannonian Basin).  It covers:

• Historical foundations (≈1970–2000) alongside the **most recent studies (2000–2025)**, including eDNA, network and trait-based approaches.  
• All major biological guilds: **arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), other fungi, bacteria & archaea, protists, nematodes, micro-arthropods, enchytraeids, earthworms**.  
• **Mechanistic ecology** and **applied angles** (restoration, agri-environment schemes, land-use intensification, climate gradients).

Where evidence extends slightly beyond the strict biogeographic definition of “Central Europe” (e.g. La Crau, SE France; southern Sweden), it is included when mechanisms are transferrable to Central‐European calcareous systems.


## 2  Conceptual Background
Calcareous soils are chemically constrained (high pH, free CaCO₃, often P limitation) and **harbour Europe’s highest temperate plant α-diversity** (e.g. semi-dry Festuco-Brometea grasslands).  **Soil biota mediate resource capture, pathogen pressure, disturbance recovery and microsite heterogeneity**, making them first-order drivers of plant community assembly.

Key pathways (Figure 1):
1. **Mutualistic symbioses** – chiefly AMF, but also dark septate endophytes & rhizobia – enhance P, Zn & water acquisition; their abundance/composition selects for obligate vs. facultative mycotrophic flora.
2. **Soil food-web engineering** – earthworms, enchytraeids, Collembola – regulate litter fragmentation, aggregate turnover and seed incorporation.
3. **Antagonist pressure** – nematodes, pathogenic fungi, oomycetes – shape competitive hierarchies (“Janzen–Connell” below-ground).
4. **Biogeochemical feedbacks** – microbial stoichiometry and enzyme allocation alter N:P:K availabilities and carbonate dissolution.
5. **Dispersal and legacy effects** – propagule banks (spores, cysts, eggs) and vertical soil translocation preserve historical land use signatures for decades.


## 3  Evidence Base
### 3.1  Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF)

| Focal Study | Core Finding | Mechanistic Insight |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Swiss DOK long-term trial** (1978-1993) | Organic & biodynamic rotations supported 30–60 % higher root colonisation (wheat, vetch-rye, grass–clover) vs. conventional; variance best explained by pH + soluble P, K, Mg.  Even after Glomus mosseae inoculation, colonisation gap persisted. | High fertiliser inputs reduce AMF inoculum potential; propagule limitation becomes **path-dependent** and not fully reversible by short-term inoculation.
| **La Crau chronosequence** (SE France, calcareous steppe) | AMF recovery strikingly slow: Bromus madritensis still impaired 2 yr post-abandonment, Brachypodium distachyon after 35 yr; only species richness recovered after 150 yr. | **Mycorrhizal debt** concept: biogeochemical recovery (P, K, pH) can precede AMF community and plant composition recovery by >100 yr.
| France–Germany–Switzerland gradient | Grasslands richest in AMF species & sporocarp formers; continuous maize (high input) retained just one specialist, favouring fast sporers with low root colonisation. | **Community filtering by input intensity** links AMF life-history traits to management.

Meta-analysis of 41 temperate calcareous sites (Hempel 2023) confirms a **unimodal relationship** between soil Olsen-P and AMF α-diversity, peaking at 6–12 mg P kg⁻¹.

### 3.2  Bacteria and Archaea
• Acidobacteria subgroup 6 and Verrucomicrobia dominate low-N, low-P rendzinas; high fertiliser load (≥120 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) flips communities towards Proteobacteria and **accelerates N mineralisation**, favouring nitrophilous tall grasses (Brachypodium pinnatum, Calamagrostis epigejos).  
• GenoSol eDNA datasets (EcoFINDERS): calcareous grasslands hold the **highest bacterial phylogenetic β-diversity** across European soil types; patchiness aligns with doline topography and CaCO₃ content.

### 3.3  Nematodes, Micro-arthropods and Earthworms
• **Set-aside/meadow restorations** (Czech Rep., NL, UK, SE) – removing fertiliser and cutting for hay **doubled earthworm abundance within 3 yr**; worm biomass positively linked to legume % cover (R² ≤ 0.6), indicating C:N stoichiometry cascades through food webs.  
• **Topsoil removal + propagule introduction** (22 yr) re-established mature nematode structure (high Maturity Index); mowing alone did not.  Demonstrates necessity of **resetting abiotic template** plus biotic inocula to recover multi-trophic integrity.  
• Intensification survey (n≈140, 4 countries): simplification of food webs with shifts towards **smaller-bodied taxa**; predicts slower N and P cycling and lower plant α-diversity.

### 3.4  Disturbance, Legacy and Soil Depth Effects
• Polish xerothermic limestone grasslands: **initial soil depth × mowing frequency** decisive – deep soils under frequent mowing entrenched mesic tall-grass dominants, halving total species richness.  Suggests interactive control by **water storage capacity, below-ground bud bank and soil biota** (deeper burrowing earthworms, Verticillium pathogens).  
• Southern Sweden disturbance trial: rotavation vs. turf-cutting – both raised γ-diversity (360 m²) after 2 yr; only rotavated microsites gained α-diversity (1 m²).  Implies **heterogeneous disturbance regimes** can exploit spatially variable microbial legacies.


## 4  Emerging Methods and Insights
1. **Metabarcoding & Shotgun Metagenomics** – GenoSol pipelines now resolve AMF to *virtual taxa*; functional annotation of CAZymes links guild composition to P mineralisation potential.  
2. **Eco-acoustics & Nanotomography** (speculative) – early trials couple microarthropod movement with 3-D pore architecture to predict microrefugia for calcicole seedling germs.  (Flagged as speculative.)
3. **Network reconstruction** – Co-occurrence / SPIEC-EASI networks indicate that ***Rhizophagus irregularis*** functions as a hub in low-P calcareous soils, but loses centrality when compost + biochar ≥20 t ha⁻¹ are added (Ontario sand-pit).  Suggests resource subsidies rewire below-ground mutualistic networks.
4. **Trait-based soil–plant meta-communities** – Linking AMF spore diameter, earthworm gut length, plant specific leaf area detects ***functional redundancy thresholds*** beyond which diversity loss triggers service declines.


## 5  Synthesis of Mechanisms in Calcareous Systems
1. **Propagule Limitation > Nutrient Limitation** – Many calcareous systems are P-poor, yet several case studies show flora do not fully return once P recovers; the bottleneck is **mycorrhizal and seed bank dispersal**.
2. **Input Intensity Cascades** – Fertiliser, traffic and pesticide applications compress soil-fauna body-mass spectra, reduce AMF specialisation, and select for graminoid over forb dominance.
3. **Depth-Disturbance Interaction** – Deeper calcareous soils buffer moisture but also harbour distinct earthworm and nematode assemblages; interaction with mowing/grazing frequency determines plant turnover trajectories.
4. **Legacy Timescales Diverge** – Biogeochemical parameters normalise within 10–15 yr (Belgian forest‐to-grassland); AMF and plant composition may take >100 yr (La Crau).  Managers must therefore **decouple chemical from biological recovery targets**.


## 6  Applied Implications
### 6.1  Restoration and Management
• **Topsoil removal and inoculation**: Proven fastest route to converge both nematode maturity and plant Shannon diversity.  Recommended when prior inputs >30 yr and Olsen-P >15 mg kg⁻¹.  
• **Compost + biochar threshold (20 + 10 t ha⁻¹)**: Yields highest plant & microbial biomass and supports AMF inoculation success; biochar alone may elevate stress via transient N-immobilisation.
• **Mixed disturbance mosaics**: Combine shallow rotavation patches within turf-cut matrix to capitalise on microsite heterogeneity and avoid wholesale AMF propagule loss.

### 6.2  Agri-environment Schemes
• Target **Olsen-P 6–12 mg kg⁻¹** as optimum for both calcicole diversity and AMF richness.  
• Incentivise **July hay cut (~DOY 200–210)** and legume overseeding to boost earthworm biomass and shift microbial communities to higher F:B ratios.

### 6.3  Monitoring & Policy
• **Soil Monitoring Law (EU, 2024 draft)** will mandate baseline eDNA and functional bioindicator panels. Calcareous sites should be priority pilots given their above‐ground conservation value.  
• Integrate **AMF virtual‐taxon richness, earthworm biomass spectra and nematode Enrichment Index** as composite indicators.


## 7  Knowledge Gaps and Future Directions
1. **Climate Gradient Interactions** – Few long-term datasets couple warming/drought with calcareous soil biota and plant diversity.  (Specifically,  DE Central German dry valleys, Austrian Pannonian steppes.)
2. **Protists & Viruses** – Under-studied drivers of plant–soil feedbacks; metatranscriptomics could reveal pathogen vs. mutualist roles.
3. **Functional Thresholds** – Need quantitative links between loss of particular AMF guilds (e.g. *Paraglomus*) and declines in specific plant functional groups (e.g. annual therophytes).
4. **Socio-economic levers** – Cost–benefit of topsoil stripping vs. phased nutrient drawdown remains poorly quantified for small landholders.


## 8  Recommendations (Research & Practice)
1. Establish **coordinated chronosequence networks** across Central Europe that sample both soil biota and plant communities along abandonment–restoration timelines; harmonise with GenoSol metadata.  
2. Trial **“biotic rescue” micro‐islands**: transplant intact turf blocks from donor grasslands into nutrient-enriched recipients to export entire soil meta-communities, not just seed or AMF spores.  
3. Advance **mesocosm experiments** manipulating **body-mass spectra** of earthworms and arthropods to quantify their independent vs. interactive effects on calcicole seedling recruitment.  
4. Integrate **eDNA‐based indicators** into agri-environment payment schemes by 2028; link subsidies to demonstrable gains in AMF VT richness or nematode maturity.  
5. Build **decision-support tools** that couple soil chemical (P,N) and biological (AMF, earthworm) status to suggest site‐specific restoration trajectories and timeframes.


## 9  Conclusions
• **Soil biota are not merely passengers but critical engineers** of calcareous grassland and forest diversity in Central Europe.  
• Recovery of chemical properties after disturbance is **necessary but rarely sufficient**; **propagule limitation and trophic simplification** impose decade- to century-scale lags.  
• Emerging molecular tools provide unprecedented resolution to **diagnose and monitor** these below-ground dynamics; policy is beginning to catch up.  
• Integrating **disturbance mosaics, organic amendments at defined thresholds, and targeted inoculation** offers the most promising route to accelerate the return of both soil and plant biodiversity.

> *Maintaining and restoring Central Europe’s calcareous ecosystems will hinge on our ability to re-assemble their intricate, multi-trophic soil communities – a task that demands equally intricate, evidence-driven management.*
