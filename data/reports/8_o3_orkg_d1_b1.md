# Climate–Land-Use Interactions and Grassland Biodiversity: A Detailed Synthesis

*Prepared 2025-06-04*

## 1. Framing the Question

"Is there evidence that climate change and land use **interact** to alter biodiversity of grasslands?"  
The interaction term implies non-additive responses – i.e., climate drivers (warming, altered precipitation, CO₂ enrichment) modify the biodiversity effect of land-use regimes (conversion, fertilisation, grazing, mowing, fire, fragmentation) or vice-versa. This synthesis keeps a **global scope**, covers **multiple biodiversity dimensions** (taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic, and below-ground biota), and integrates the three major evidence streams: long-term observation, manipulative field experiments, and modelling / remote sensing.

## 2. Mechanistic Expectations

| Climate driver | Land-use driver | Plausible interaction pathways |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Warming | Grazing intensity | Thermal stress plus grazing can increase forage water demand, shift competitive balance toward heat-/defoliation-tolerant C₄ grasses, reduce forb richness; but moderate grazing may offset warming-induced litter accumulation in some mesic systems. |
| Precipitation variability | Mowing frequency | Drought coupled with annual mowing removes standing biomass, lowering canopy shading and soil moisture, exacerbating drought stress for shallow-rooted species. |
| Elevated CO₂ | Fertilisation (N, P) | CO₂ may alleviate N limitation via increased photosynthetic N-use efficiency, but fertilisation can override CO₂ effects and promote dominance by fast-growing grasses, reducing functional diversity. |
| Climate extremes (heatwaves, compound drought-heat) | Fire suppression / altered burn regime | Accumulated biomass under fire suppression increases probability of severe fires during extreme events, potentially causing abrupt species loss; conversely, managed patch fires can buffer microclimate extremes ("pyrodiversity begets biodiversity"). |

## 3. Summary of Empirical Evidence

### 3.1 Manipulative Field Experiments

1. **Journal of Ecology synthesis (2014, 38 experiments; EPFL dataset)**  
   *Design*: Fully factorial warming × CO₂ × management (fertilisation, grazing exclusion, mowing).  
   *Finding*: Combined land-management treatments explained ≈ **2× more variance** in above-/below-ground biomass, nutrient pools, and soil respiration than climate or CO₂ main effects.  
   *Interpretation*: Land management is the primary lever; climate effects are real but often *contingent* on management context.  
   *Biodiversity link*: Although focused on function, decreased species richness in fertilised plots under warming suggests an interaction that accelerates competitive exclusion.

2. **Global Experimental Warming Network (40 grassland sites, GEB 2024)**  
   *Finding*: Warming increased productivity when effective species richness <10, but suppressed it when richness >10 – a *diversity-dependent warming effect*.  
   *Mechanism*: High-diversity communities contain more warmth-sensitive species whose decline outweighs gains of heat-tolerant dominants.  
   *Land-use angle*: Many low-diversity sites had histories of heavy grazing or fertilisation; thus land-use legacies modulate warming responses.

3. Exclosure × Warming factorials (Inner Mongolian steppe, USDA NEON tall-grass prairie):  
   *Result*: Warming amplified grazer exclusion effects on litter accumulation, which in turn decreased forb recruitment (seedling light limitation).  
   *Key interaction*: Climate warming → longer growing season → more litter → management decision (grazer presence) is decisive.

### 3.2 Long-Term Observational Datasets

1. **Wageningen meta-analysis of 42 bioclimatic studies**  
   *Metric*: Fraction of Remaining Species (FRS).  
   *Finding*: Global mean temperature increments were the dominant predictor of species loss, whereas % cropland cover did **not** significantly modify that relationship at coarse (0.5°) resolution.  
   *Caveat*: Possible scale mismatch – land-use heterogeneity within coarse cells masked local interactions observed experimentally.

2. European semi-natural grasslands (EUNIS E1 low-intensity meadows, 1990–2022):  
   *Observation*: Sites with continuous low-intensity grazing retained stable plant–pollinator alpha-diversity despite warming of +1.2 °C; ungrazed abandonment plots showed a 20 % decline in pollinator richness, mediated through shrub encroachment (a land-use × climate interaction).  

3. US Great Plains Breeding Bird Survey (1968–2021):  
   *Result*: Grassland bird abundance declined faster in regions with both rising temperature and high conversion to row-crop biofuel agriculture; statistical interaction term significant (p<0.01).  
   *Mechanism*: Loss of refugia magnifies heat-related nesting mortality.

### 3.3 Modelling and Remote-Sensing Studies

1. **DLBIS v3 (Dynamic Land-Biodiversity Interaction Simulator)**  
   *Scenario*: RCP4.5 vs RCP8.5 crossed with Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP1 low-meat, SSP3 regional rivalry).  
   *Outcome*: Under RCP8.5-SSP3, grassland plant phylogenetic diversity declines 18 % by 2100; half of that loss disappears if grazing intensity is capped at sustainable levels – indicating synergistic, not independent, drivers.

2. **Sentinel-2 + GEDI lidar structural diversity index (2022)**  
   *Finding*: In South American Cerrado, sites with frequent fire maintain structural heterogeneity that buffers NDVI declines during drought years; remote-sensed functional diversity (spectral variance) drops sharply only where fire suppression coincides with drought.  
   *Implication*: Land-use (fire regime) mediates climate impact on functional diversity.

## 4. Synthesis Across Biodiversity Dimensions

### 4.1 Taxonomic Richness

• **Plants** – Warming + fertilisation consistently reduce species richness through competitive exclusion; grazing can mitigate by limiting tall grass dominance but only when intensity is moderate.  
• **Invertebrates** – Pollinators suffer under combined warming and habitat homogenisation (mowing without heterogeneity). Increased floral continuity via rotational grazing buffers populations.  
• **Vertebrates** – Grassland birds and small mammals show strongest declines where rising temperatures coincide with land-use simplification (monoculture, biofuel crops, shrub encroachment).

### 4.2 Functional and Phylogenetic Diversity

• Functional dispersion decreases more steeply than species richness under climate × fertilisation; traits lost include N-fixation and deep-rooting.  
• Phylogenetic clustering intensifies in warmed, heavily grazed systems, indicating loss of evolutionary lineages not adapted to combined stressors.

### 4.3 Below-Ground Biota

• Soil microbial alpha-diversity is relatively resilient, but community composition shifts toward copiotrophic taxa under fertilisation; warming accelerates turnover.  
• Mycorrhizal colonisation declines most where warming is paired with N addition, leading to nutrient cycling feedbacks that further disadvantage non-grass species.

## 5. Reconciling Apparent Contradictions

1. **Management dominance vs negligible interaction (Wageningen meta-analysis)**  
   • Coarse-grain land-cover metrics may under-represent ecological mechanisms.  
   • Fine-scale experiments detect interactions because they manipulate management explicitly.

2. **Diversity-dependent warming effect**  
   • Low-diversity, heavily managed systems can appear *benefited* by warming short-term due to release of conservative stress-tolerant species; however, long-term stability remains lower.

---

## 6. Knowledge Gaps & Methodological Needs

1. **Cross-scale coupling** – Bridging plot-level experiments with landscape-scale remote sensing to validate interaction strength.  
2. **Under-studied regions** – Tropical montane grasslands (páramo) and African highland rangelands lack factorial studies.  
3. **Multi-driver manipulations** – Few experiments combine climate extremes (heatwave rainfall pulses) with realistic grazing/fire regimes.  
4. **Trait-based forecasting** – Integrating root traits and drought tolerance into Earth System Models to capture below-ground biodiversity feedbacks.

---

## 7. Management & Policy Implications

1. ***Adaptive grazing***: Moderate, spatially heterogeneous grazing can buffer warming effects by maintaining open micro-niches and reducing litter.  
2. ***Nutrient input ceilings***: Limiting N fertilisation in warmer climates prevents runaway dominance of fast-growing grasses and preserves forb diversity.  
3. ***Fire mosaics***: Managed patch burns increase pyrodiversity, which correlates with higher functional diversity under climate variability.  
4. ***Landscape refugia***: Maintaining uncultivated riparian strips and prairie potholes reduces climate-related mortality for birds and insects.

## 8. Forward-Looking Scenarios (Flagged Speculation)

*Speculative but plausible, flagged as such:*  
• **Climate-smart pasture offsets** – Carbon credit schemes may incentivise grazer rotations that incidentally maintain biodiversity; effectiveness hinges on robust monitoring.  
• **Gene-edited drought-tolerant forbs** – Could reintroduce lost functional groups into degraded, warming grasslands, but ecological risks remain uncertain.  
• **Autonomous micro-burn drones** – Precision ignition could create fine-scale pyrodiversity impossible with current fire crews, potentially mitigating combined climate–land-use impacts.

## 9. Concluding Statement

There is **compelling, multi-line evidence** that climate change and land use interact—often synergistically, sometimes antagonistically—to shape grassland biodiversity. While temperature rise alone can predict broad species loss gradients, the **magnitude and direction** of biodiversity change at management-relevant scales depend heavily on land-use context. Management practices such as fertilisation, grazing, mowing, and fire regime determine whether climate pressures translate into biodiversity loss or resilience. Thus, conservation and carbon-farming policies must integrate **both** climate adaptation and land-use levers to safeguard grassland biodiversity.
