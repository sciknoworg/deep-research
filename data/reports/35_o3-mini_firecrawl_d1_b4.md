# A Comprehensive Analysis of the Biodiversity–Ecosystem Function Relationship in Non-Grassland Ecosystems

This report synthesizes findings from diverse research strands, integrating empirical evidence, conceptual frameworks, and interdisciplinary approaches to elucidate the mechanisms driving the biodiversity–ecosystem function (BEF) relationship in ecosystems beyond grasslands. Although much early work focused on grasslands, insights now increasingly encompass forests, aquatic systems, deserts, and wetlands. In this document we detail the multiple drivers and dynamic interactions that regulate ecosystem functioning, with particular emphasis on biotic interactions, abiotic drivers, complex adaptive systems, and cross-boundary linkages.

## 1. Introduction

Understanding how biodiversity impacts ecosystem functions is a central issue in ecological research and applied conservation. While several controlled experiments and observational studies originally used grassland systems as a model, recent studies reveal that the mechanisms linking biodiversity to ecosystem productivity, nutrient cycling, and stability hold across a range of ecosystems. In ecosystems such as forests, aquatic, and other non-grassland environments, distinct biotic interactions and abiotic constraints—notably climate, nutrient availability, and disturbance regimes—play primary roles in shaping community dynamics.

The core question addressed here is: _Which mechanisms drive the BEF relationship in non‐grassland ecosystems?_ The answer lies in a confluence of processes that include, but are not limited to, species assembly (whether via natural, non‐random turnover or experimental random assembly), competitive interactions, facilitative processes, and the modulation by abiotic conditions. Notably, while early criticisms of random biodiversity loss experiments noted discrepancies relative to natural species turnover, current comparative analyses suggest that these experiments capture crucial underlying mechanisms. Herein, we integrate learnings from simulation studies, long‐term experiments, conceptual frameworks such as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS), and cross-boundary analyses to provide a detailed picture of BEF mechanisms beyond grasslands.

## 2. Biotic Mechanisms in Non-Grassland Ecosystems

### A. Dominant Species and Trait-Based Effects

A recurring theme in biodiversity research is the disproportionate influence of dominant species and trait-based effects on ecosystem processes. Research in forest systems, for example, has demonstrated that species contributions are often mediated by particular functional traits—ranging from shade tolerance to nutrient uptake efficiency—that dictate how communities respond to environmental changes. In forest mixtures such as aspen–spruce assemblages (modeled using systems like GYPSY), simulations reveal that competitive dynamics are significantly influenced by stand age and species composition. These studies estimate that mixed forest stands may produce net biodiversity effects averaging around 14.3 m³/ha, reflecting a balance between positive interspecific interactions and competitive dominance.

Furthermore, the integration of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic metrics has become essential for a holistic understanding of ecosystem responses. Not only do diversity metrics capture the sheer number of species present, but they also account for the range of traits that mediate compatibility and complementary resource use, ultimately influencing ecosystem productivity and stability.

### B. Interspecific Complementarity, Facilitation, and Competitive Partitioning

In non‐grassland ecosystems, competitive exclusion is often balanced by facilitative interactions. Additive partitioning methods (e.g., those popularized by Loreau & Hector, 2001) separate net biodiversity impacts into complementarity and selection effects. However, recent work questions whether such methods adequately differentiate between various biotic interplay types. A competitive partitioning model has been introduced to address this, using competitive growth responses derived from partial-density monocultures versus full-density yields. This method distinguishes competitive, facilitative (positive), and negative species interactions, providing a more nuanced understanding of how species interactions drive ecosystem productivity across different contexts.

### C. Biotic Interactions Across Trophic Levels

Beyond plant–plant interactions, an integrative approach considering trophic network structures has highlighted the importance of predators, soil microbes, and decomposers. In multiple ecosystems, enhanced biodiversity not only contributes directly to primary production but also indirectly promotes stability through mechanisms such as top‐down predator control and efficient nutrient recycling. This trophic dynamism can be particularly pronounced in forest and aquatic systems, where food webs are complex and the interplay among organisms spans multiple scales.

## 3. Abiotic Influences and Cross-Ecosystem Interactions

### A. Abiotic Drivers: Climate, Nutrient Cycling, and Environmental Heterogeneity

Abiotic factors are fundamental in shaping the BEF relationship. In non‐grassland systems, light availability, water regimes, soil properties, and temperature gradients create environmental filters that significantly affect species performance and interactions. For example, forests are subject to variations in light penetration due to canopy structure, while aquatic systems are governed by factors such as water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and oxygen levels. The interplay of these abiotic factors with biotic diversity can modify resource‐use efficiency and ecosystem resilience. This leads to observable patterns such as increased carbon sequestration and enhanced nutrient cycling, particularly in systems where biodiversity promotes niche complementarity and stabilizes ecosystem processes over the long term.

### B. Cross-Boundary Ecosystem Dynamics

A newly developed conceptual framework emphasizes three major pathways that link terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems:

1. **Direct Resource Transfer**: The movement of resources (e.g., leaf litter, insects, and nutrients) directly impacts adjacent ecosystems, altering both donor and recipient ecosystem functions.
2. **Indirect Effects via Biodiversity Influence**: Diversity within a donor system can influence the species composition in a neighboring ecosystem, often through dispersal or connectivity corridors.
3. **Functional Changes in Donor Systems**: Shifts in donor ecosystem functioning—such as changes in productivity or nutrient cycling—may propagate effects to connected systems, particularly when considered over larger spatial scales or across trophic levels.

These insights underscore that biodiversity effects cannot be confined to single, isolated ecosystems but must be considered in a broader landscape context. They are particularly critical for understanding the connectivity between forested regions and aquatic systems, where biotic and abiotic drivers operate synergistically.

## 4. Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) and Long-Term Experimentation

### A. Ecosystems as Complex Adaptive Systems

Adopting the lens of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) provides a powerful framework to rationalize the multifaceted interactions in ecosystems. From this perspective, ecosystem functioning emerges as a macroscopic result of multiple, dynamic interactions among biotic components (plants, microbes, consumers) and abiotic drivers (climate, nutrient availability, disturbance). Key to this understanding is the recognition of feedback loops, environmental autocorrelation, and the influence of dispersal and spatial scaling. In non‐grassland ecosystems such as forests and wetlands, emergent properties like resilience and multifunctionality are best understood through the CAS framework.

### B. Long-Term Experimental Evidence

Long-term experiments such as the Jena Experiment in grasslands, Cedar Creek, and BIODEPTH offer crucial insights into how biodiversity effects evolve over time—a finding also supported in non-grassland contexts via long-term studies in forest plots and aquatic mesocosms.

1. **Temporal Strengthening of Biodiversity Benefits**: For instance, in controlled experiments monitoring carbon pools and biomass production, heightened species richness resulted in substantial increases in aboveground (+51%) and belowground biomass (+30%). These benefits accrue as ecological processes like niche complementarity and plant–soil feedbacks take hold, underscoring the value of long-term data in forecasting ecosystem trajectories.

2. **Evolving Interaction Dynamics**: Ecosystems typically display a shift over time from initial competitive interactions (that may dampen growth) towards stable states where facilitative interactions and effective resource partitioning dominate. This trend highlights the need to incorporate time as a critical dimension in the BEF framework, particularly in non‐grassland systems where long-term legacies of species interactions form a cornerstone of ecosystem dynamics.

## 5. Interdisciplinary Insights and Future Perspectives

### A. Integrating Agricultural and Ecological Approaches

Interdisciplinary work blending ecology, agricultural science, and agroecology has revealed that the mechanisms underlying BEF relationships are robust across diverse systems. In agricultural landscapes and natural forests alike, greater biodiversity not only amplifies productivity but also bolsters resilience against disturbances such as drought. Mechanisms such as increased resource-use efficiency and top-down regulation by predators have been documented, emphasizing that the principles discovered in experimental settings (e.g., nutrient cycling, soil biota interactions) are broadly applicable across ecosystem types.

### B. Climate Change and Global Implications

In the current era of rapid climate change, non‐grassland ecosystems face additional stressors. Climate-driven alterations in species phenology, range shifts, and disrupted trophic interactions all affect the underlying BEF dynamics. For example, polar and aquatic systems are currently experiencing significant trophic cascades partly due to altered temperature regimes and shifting predator–prey relationships. The resilience imparted by high biodiversity may thus serve as a buffer against such disturbances, a hypothesis that warrants further empirical scrutiny in forest and desert ecosystems as well.

### C. Mechanistic Innovations and Future Research Directions

While the current body of research provides comprehensive insights, several areas require further exploration:

1. **Development of Integrated Metrics**: Future work should prioritize the integration of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity metrics to better predict ecosystem responses under diverse environmental conditions.

2. **Refinement of Competitive Partitioning Models**: Expanding on competitive partitioning frameworks in non-grassland systems may reveal nuanced interactions that traditional partitioning methods obscure. This includes dissecting competitive, facilitative, and antagonistic relationships within complex food webs.

3. **Exploration of Cross-Ecosystem Linkages**: More detailed studies on ‘donor-recipient’ dynamics between ecosystems can elucidate mechanisms of cross-boundary nutrient and energy flow, further highlighting the interconnectedness of terrestrial and aquatic systems.

4. **Leveraging New Technologies**: Remote sensing, high-resolution spatial analysis, and advanced simulation models (akin to GYPSY in forest systems) could offer unprecedented detail on how species interactions and environmental gradients interact over time and space.

5. **Transdisciplinary Collaboration**: Increasing collaboration among ecologists, climate scientists, soil scientists, and data modelers will help synthesize multi-scalar data and refine existing ecological models, which is critical for predicting ecosystem responses under future environmental scenarios.

## 6. Conclusion

The biodiversity–ecosystem function relationship in non‐grassland ecosystems emerges from the interplay between biotic interactions and abiotic environmental factors. Forests, aquatic systems, and other ecosystems exhibit intricate networks where dominant species, functional trait diversity, nutrient cycling, and cross-boundary resource transfers collectively yield the emergent ecosystem properties observed at larger scales. The application of Complex Adaptive Systems theory, combined with long-term experimental research, has provided a basis for understanding these dynamics in detail.

In summary, a comprehensive approach that incorporates multiple diversity metrics and mechanistic insights from both field and experimental studies is essential for advancing our understanding of BEF relationships. Future research, leveraging new technologies and interdisciplinary collaboration, will continue to elucidate the pathway-specific processes that regulate ecosystem productivity and resilience worldwide, thereby informing effective conservation and management strategies in a changing global climate.
