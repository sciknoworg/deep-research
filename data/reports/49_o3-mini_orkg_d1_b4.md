## Abstract

This report synthesizes multiple strands of research on restoration methodologies in semi‐natural grasslands and related ecosystems, specifically focusing on the conditions where mowing may be more efficient than grazing in restoring plant diversity. Drawing from field experiments, meta-analyses, and long-term observational studies across diverse geographical contexts (ranging from southern Sweden to Botswana and Tasmania), we explore the impacts of mowing frequency, seasonal timing, technical regimes, and the underlying ecological mechanisms that drive plant community responses. We detail the factors that modulate diversity responses such as competitive interactions, soil disturbance, nutrient cycling, and species-specific responses, ultimately offering a comprehensive framework for managers interested in harnessing mechanical management tools for biodiversity conservation.

## Introduction

Restoring plant diversity in managed grasslands involves balancing disturbance with species’ ecological dynamics. Both mowing and grazing are widely used management tools; however, they often differ in their ecological impacts. Mowing can be carefully controlled regarding timing, frequency, and intensity, lessening the uncontrolled effects often seen with grazing. Grazing, in contrast, introduces not only defoliation but also physical soil disturbances and nutrient inputs (e.g., via manure), which can affect competitive interactions among plant species. In this report, we examine when and why mowing may outperform grazing in the context of restoring plant diversity, particularly in ecosystems such as species-rich semi‐natural grasslands, lowland tussock communities, and productive grasslands. We draw from extensive research, integrating findings on mowing regimes, grazing intensity, technical comparisons of equipment, and regional case studies.

## Overview of Ecosystems and Management Contexts

### 1. Ecosystem and Plant Community Considerations

The applicability of mowing vs. grazing varies with ecosystem type and its inherent productivity. The following are key ecosystem contexts:

- **Semi-Natural Grasslands:** In European settings, particularly in southern Sweden, data indicate that mowing regimes (especially annual mowing) increase indicator species associated with good management, thereby helping to maintain species richness and balance nutrient inputs. Grazing, especially at low intensities, may elevate nitrogen levels, possibly promoting nitrophilous species that can outcompete others.

- **Productive Grasslands:** In productive systems, increased mowing frequency has been shown to yield positive biodiversity effects. Frequent mowing in such ecosystems can disrupt competitive exclusion, thus promoting a more diverse plant assemblage.

- **Lowland Tussock Grasslands and Specific Regions (e.g., Pontville, Tasmania):** These settings have shown that extreme mowing frequencies can enhance the cover of native and rare species, indicating that mowing under the right conditions may be more beneficial than grazing.

- **Other Global Case Studies:** Comparative studies in Botswana and southwest Montana underscore the importance of timing and frequency in grazing regimes, suggesting that these contextual variables can shift the balance between mowing and grazing efficiency in restoring diversity.

### 2. Management Regimes: Timing, Frequency, and Intensity

A key variable across multiple studies is the frequency of mowing. For instance:

- **Annual vs. Multi-year Mowing:** Studies in Sweden have demonstrated that annual mowing generally maintains higher species richness compared to mowing at intervals such as every third year. Remarkably, even extended impact trails spanning 38 years have validated the long-term benefits of frequent mowing for diversity outcomes.

- **Grazing Timing and Frequency:** Field experiments reveal that the timing of grazing (e.g., early- vs. late-season) significantly influences the biomass and proportion of plant functional groups like forbs and graminoids. In some cases, early-season grazing might reduce biomass to levels that favor certain species, yet repeated defoliation can lead to an exponential decline in sensitive species like Brachiaria nigropedata.

- **Seasonal Contexts:** Seasonal timing plays a critical role in both regimes. Mowing performed in the optimal phenological window can ensure seed set and minimize competitive interference, whereas grazing during certain times might not afford the recovery periods needed for sensitive species.

## Mechanistic Insights: Underlying Ecological Processes

Understanding why mowing may sometimes be preferable requires a close look at the ecological mechanisms underpinning restoration outcomes. Several factors are central:

### 1. Seed Dispersal and Recruitment

- **Mowing:** By cutting plants uniformly, especially on an annual schedule, mowing may promote seed dispersal patterns that are conducive to the recruitment of a broader spectrum of species. The relatively homogeneous disturbance minimizes tree visitation by opportunistic, nitrophilous species that might otherwise dominate disturbed patches.

- **Grazing:** Grazing animals are selective feeders. Their defoliation patterns, coupled with patchy nutrient deposition, can create microsites that favor opportunistic species over late successional species. This spatial heterogeneity might sometimes hinder the establishment of a diversified seed bank.

### 2. Soil Disturbance and Nutrient Cycling

- **Soil Compaction and Disturbance:** Mowing is largely a non-compactive disturbance when compared to some forms of grazing. The mechanical action of cutting does not significantly disturb the soil structure. Conversely, the trampling associated with grazing can compact soils, altering water infiltration and microbial dynamics, which in turn may favor a less diverse plant community.

- **Nutrient Inputs:** Grazing typically introduces additional nitrogen into the system (via manure deposition), leading to conditions that favor rapid-growing, nitrophilous species. Long-term studies in Swedish grasslands have shown that low-intensity grazing is associated with an increased presence of such indicator species for excess nitrogen. Mowing limits this nitrogen enrichment, thereby supporting a balance that enables a broader species base.

### 3. Competitive Interactions and Species Composition

- **Competition for Light and Resources:** Mowing’s uniform removal of above-ground biomass can temporarily reduce competitive hierarchies in species-rich grasslands—allowing less competitive species to regenerate and establish. In contrast, grazing can be biased toward certain palatable species, intensifying competitive exclusion of less grazing-tolerant species.

- **Disturbance-Driven Succession:** Evidence from meta-analyses across European grasslands suggests that while both mowing and grazing are forms of disturbance, the relatively predictable and uniform disturbance imposed by mowing fosters a better environment for the persistence of diverse species in the long run.

## Comparative Analysis and Case Studies

### 1. Long-Term Field Experiments and Meta-Analyses

Drawing from long-term Swedish field experiments and meta-analyses encompassing over 35 studies, the following observations emerge:

- **Indicator Species Occurrence:** Annual mowing correlates with higher odds of detecting indicator species characteristic of well-managed, species-rich grasslands. Although grazing can show moderate positive effects on biodiversity in some cases, these benefits are often context-dependent and less predictable.

- **Grazing vs. Mowing in Semi-Natural Grasslands:** In semi-natural grasslands, grazing is demonstrated to afford slight advantages in particular contexts, yet its effectiveness depends on the intensity and timing of the grazing events. Mowing often provides a more reliable restoration technique when the objective is to avoid nutrient over-enrichment and to mitigate potential soil compaction effects.

### 2. Equipment and Technical Comparisons

Studies comparing mechanical mowing techniques, such as the hand-pushed sickle bar mower versus grass trimmers, have generally found negligible differences in their effects on vegetation composition over long-term assessments (e.g., a 12-year trial in southeastern Sweden). This suggests that the choice of equipment—when deployed appropriately—may be less critical than the frequency and timing of mowing.

### 3. Integration of Grazing and Mowing

Some studies, notably in lowland tussock grasslands of Tasmania, indicate that an integrated approach combining mowing and grazing can, in specific settings, optimize native species cover. In these scenarios, mowing may be used to reset competitive dynamics followed by controlled grazing to manage biomass and maintain open structures. However, for sites where nutrient cycling and soil disturbance are a primary concern, mowing as a standalone strategy often proves to be more efficient in restoring and maintaining plant diversity.

## Discussion

### When is Mowing More Efficient?

The key takeaways suggest that mowing becomes comparatively more efficient in restoring plant diversity under the following conditions:

1. **High Productivity Ecosystems:** In highly productive grasslands, the risk of competitive exclusion is higher. Frequent mowing (annual or more frequent, depending on site specifics) reduces dominance by aggressive species, thereby boosting diversity.

2. **Avoidance of Nutrient Over-Enrichment:** In contexts where grazing results in excess nitrogen through manure deposition, mowing preserves a nutrient balance that benefits a broader array of species. For instance, long-term experiments in Sweden illustrate that low-intensity grazing can inadvertently favor nitrophilous species, whereas annual mowing sustains a diverse indicator species profile.

3. **Soil Integrity and Reduced Compaction:** Mowing minimizes soil disturbance and compaction that often accompany grazing. Preserving soil structure is critically important in maintaining water infiltration and microbial activity—factors that contribute to long-term plant diversity.

4. **Uniform Disturbance Regimes:** When a uniform approach to disturbance is desired—for example, to ensure equitable seed dispersal and minimize local pockets of competitive dominance—mowing offers a predictable mechanism, unlike the variability inherent in animal behavior during grazing.

5. **Ecosystem-Specific Considerations:** In ecosystems where the ecological balance is sensitive to physical disturbances (e.g., fragile semi‐natural grasslands), mowing can be modulated to ensure minimal impact on soil microbial communities and maintain subtle cues for seed germination and establishment.

### Underlying Ecological Mechanisms as a Rationale

Beyond simple observed outcomes, the mechanistic rationale centers on the predictability and control associated with mowing. The uniform clipping mechanism avoids the heterogeneity of disturbance naturally introduced by grazing animals, allowing managers to target specific phenological phases, thereby promoting the recruitment of a diverse seed bank and limiting conditions conducive to dominance by a few species.

### Challenges and Considerations

Despite these advantages, it is critical to recognize several challenges and trade-offs:

- **Species-Specific Responses:** Some plant species might require the patchy disturbance that grazing provides. Hence, the choice of regime must account for the particular species composition and management objectives of a site.

- **Resource Constraints and Operational Costs:** Although mowing can be resource-efficient in some setups (especially when fewer passes are needed), the frequency of mowing operations must be balanced against cost, fuel use, and labor, particularly in extensive landscapes.

- **Integration Possibilities:** In certain scenarios, an integrated approach that leverages the benefits of both mowing and grazing may be optimal. For example, mowing might be employed during critical growth periods followed by controlled, low-intensity grazing to maintain open-canopy conditions. Such adaptive management strategies require detailed site assessments and monitoring protocols.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

### Synthesis

Comprehensive review of the literature indicates that mowing can be more efficient than grazing in restoring plant diversity under certain well-defined conditions. Specifically, in ecosystems where high productivity, nutrient enrichment, and soil structure concerns dominate the conservation agenda, mowing—particularly under frequent, controlled regimes—offers significant benefits. Long-term studies, both in Sweden and internationally, back the argument that annual or more frequent mowing leads to enhanced species richness and improved indicators of good management compared to low-intensity grazing.

### Future Research Avenues

Moving forward, research should focus on refining the mechanistic understanding of how mowing frequency and timing interact with site-specific ecological variables. Areas worthy of further investigation include:

- **Comparative Dynamics in Mixed Regimes:** More experiments integrating both mowing and grazing to identify optimal combinations that harness the strengths of each management tool.
- **Technological Innovations:** Evaluating newer mechanical mowing technologies and precision cutting techniques that minimize collateral damage to the habitat, and potentially coupling these practices with remote sensing for enhanced monitoring.
- **Ecosystem Modeling:** Developing predictive models that integrate seasonal variations, soil health, and competitive interactions to guide adaptive management practices.

### Final Recommendations for Practitioners

1. **Site-Specific Management:** Assess local conditions comprehensively before selecting mowing as a restoration tool. Consider soil health, existing nutrient levels, and species composition.
2. **Regular Monitoring:** Implement robust monitoring procedures to track ecological changes over time. Utilize indicator species as benchmarks for management effectiveness.
3. **Hybrid Approaches:** Evaluate the potential benefits of integrated management regimes that combine mowing and grazing, particularly in ecosystems with complex competitive dynamics.
4. **Consider Scale and Cost:** Account for operational constraints in large-scale implementations. While mowing may be technical-equivalent across equipment types, the scale of operations might influence overall costs and efficiency.

In summary, for experts aiming to maximize plant diversity restoration, mowing—when optimally timed and executed—presents a promising strategy, particularly in contexts where soil integrity, nutrient balance, and uniform disturbance are critical. This detailed synthesis of research should provide a robust starting point for future interventions tailored to the specific requirements of diverse ecosystems.
