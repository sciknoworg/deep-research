# Designing a Field-Realistic Concentration Range for Pesticide–Bee Experiments

## 1. Framing the Experimental Question
The apparently simple question – *“What is a realistic pesticide range for an experiment on bee impacts?”* – conceals several interacting dimensions that must be resolved before concentrations can be fixed:

1. **Active ingredient / formulation** (systemic neonicotinoid, foliar pyrethroid, in‐hive acaricide, etc.)
2. **Exposure pathway** (ingestion via nectar/pollen, topical/contact, vapor, in-hive matrix)
3. **Temporal profile**: acute (hours–days) vs. chronic (10 d, 21 d, full season) and whether bees are allowed to recover in clean forage.
4. **Biological level** of response (individual mortality, sub-lethal physiology, colony demographics, overwintering success).
5. **Co-stressors** that modify dose–response curves (pathogens, varroa, landscape forage, solvents used in dosing).

Because the follow-up questions in the original prompt remain unanswered, the guidance below assumes an experiment that must cover *both acute and chronic oral exposure* for **adult worker honey bees (Apis mellifera)** yet remain expandable to other taxa or life stages. All numerical ranges can be rescaled for topical assays by converting to ng bee⁻¹.

## 2. Synthesising the Empirical Landscape
Nine discrete research learnings provide the quantitative scaffolding for realistic dosing. They are summarised here and then mapped to recommended concentration tiers.

| # | Learning (abr.) | Key Quantitative Signal |
|---|-----------------|-------------------------|
| L1 | Uruguay oxalic‐acid varroacide | Field dose = 132.8 µg bee⁻¹; NOEL = 400 µg bee⁻¹; LD50 = 548.95 µg bee⁻¹. |
| L2 | Cross-species industry dossiers | B. terrestris LD50 ≥ A. mellifera LD50 in most cases. |
| L3 | EU pollen surveys | Up to 7 residues / sample; chlorpyrifos & imidacloprid dominate; HQ often > 1 000. |
| L4 | Thiamethoxam variability | A. mellifera topical/oral LD50 ≈ 51.2 ng bee⁻¹; Africanised diet LC50 ≈ 4.28 ng µL⁻¹. |
| L5 | OECD chronic 10 d ring-test | Control mortality ≤15 % workable; solvent controls can fail. |
| L6 | Thiamethoxam × Nosema synergy | Sub-lethal range (≤10 % LD50) produces amplified mortality + immune effects. |
| L7 | Landscape multi-stress | High-input landscapes drive additive pathogen + pesticide loads. |
| L8 | Sub-lethal biomarker suite | 5.12 ng bee⁻¹ (=10 % LC50) shortens life by 41 %, RFID homing disruption. |
| L9 | Matrix-specific residues | Wax HQ > 5 000; pollen spikes > bulk hive; wax a long-term sink.

The convergence point is clear: *field-realistic* generally spans from low-ng bee⁻¹ (ingested) to tens-of-µg bee⁻¹ (in-hive treatments) depending on pathway.

## 3. Deriving a Realistic Range – A Step-wise Protocol
### 3.1 Compile Regulatory & Survey Benchmarks
1. Retrieve all EU/US/EFSA/OECD residue datasets for the focal molecule.
2. Express residues both as (a) ppb in nectar/pollen, and (b) ng bee⁻¹ assuming 30–40 mg nectar intake or ~10 mg pollen per forager in a foraging bout.
3. Extract lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC), no-observed-effect level (NOEL) and LD50 from peer-reviewed lab studies.

### 3.2 Set Concentration Tiers
Using thiamethoxam as a worked example (because the learnings contain the richest numeric detail), oral tiers would be:

Tier | Rationale | Concentration (ng a.i. bee⁻¹ day⁻¹)
-----|-----------|---------------------------------
T0   | Control (clean syrup) | 0
T1   | Background residue (median EU pollen) | 0.5 – 1
T2   | 10 × background; matches HQ ≈ 100 | 5 – 10 (≈10 % LD50 → L6, L8)
T3   | LOEC zone (sub-lethal biomarkers) | 20 – 25
T4   | LD10–LD20 screening | 30 – 40
T5   | LD50 confirmation (OECD 213/214) | 50 – 55 (per L4 = 51.16)

For oxalic acid (contact, in-hive):

Tier | Concentration (µg bee⁻¹)
----|-----------------------------
T0  | 0 (vehicle control)
T1  | Registered Uruguay dose | 130–135
T2  | 2× field rate | 260–270
T3  | NOEL | 400
T4  | LD20 – LD40 | 475 – 525

### 3.3 Duration Blocks
• Acute: 48 h for contact; 96 h for oral.
• Chronic: 10 d (align with OECD draft guideline; L5). Optionally extend to 21 d to capture whole adult life.

### 3.4 Replication & Solvent Controls
• Minimum 3 replicate cages/colonies per tier.
• Explicit solvent control if formulation requires acetone, remembering from L5 that 40 % of labs breached mortality limits in solvent-only groups.

### 3.5 Incorporate Co-stressors
Two factorial options greatly strengthen ecological relevance:
1. **Pathogen × Pesticide** (L6): ± Nosema ceranae spores at 10⁵ spores bee⁻¹.
2. **Landscape Forage Quality** (L7, L9): Place colonies in high-input vs. low-input landscapes during dosing washout.

## 4. Special Considerations by Exposure Type
### 4.1 Oral (syrup or pollen paste)
• Convert ppb → ng bee⁻¹: ng bee⁻¹ = (ppb × mg consumed) / 1 000.
• Spike freshly made syrup daily; avoid stock solution storage >24 h for unstable AIs.
• RFID or harmonic radar tracking of foragers (L8) can reveal navigation deficits.

### 4.2 Contact / Topical
• Apply 1 µL acetone droplet on dorsal thorax; let solvent evaporate 30 s.
• Adhere to the same ng bee⁻¹ tiers but note dermal LD50 is often higher than oral for neonicotinoids, lower for pyrethroids.

### 4.3 In-hive Matrices (wax, OA strips)
• Impregnate wax strips at 1×, 2×, 3× field rate (L1) and monitor cumulative strip loss to estimate realized dose.
• Sample wax/pollen weekly (L9) to validate lingering residues.

## 5. Sub-Lethal End-Points & “Early-Warning” Biomarkers
Because bees show pronounced functional decline before outright death, embed the following assays:

Endpoint | Method | Link to Learning
---------|--------|----------------
Hypopharyngeal gland area | Dissect & image day 7 | L8
Detox enzyme panel (GST, CAT, CaE1-3) | 96-well colourimetric | L8
JH III titres | LC-MS | L8
AMP gene expression (abaecin, defensin-1/-2) | RT-qPCR day 9 & 15 | L6
RNA-seq DEG screen | Illumina 2×150 bp | L8
Colony pathogen load (DWV-A/B, ABPV) | RT-qPCR | L7

## 6. Dealing with Species Variability
Learning 2 demonstrates that honey-bee acute endpoints are typically conservative for bumblebees. If expanding the design:
1. Use the same concentration tiers as for A. mellifera.
2. Confirm with a pilot LD50 to verify no unexpectedly lower tolerance.

## 7. Risk Characterisation Metrics
1. **Hazard Quotient (HQ or PHQ)** = Exposure (µg bee⁻¹ day⁻¹) / LD50.
   • Field datasets (L3) often showed HQ > 1 000; set T2–T3 to replicate HQ 10–100.
2. **Toxic Unit summation** for residues mixtures (up to 7 in L3).
3. **Interaction Factor (IF)** for pesticide × pathogen = (Observed mortality) / (Additive model expectation). Values >1 signal synergy (L6).

## 8. Potential Experimental Pitfalls & Mitigations
Pitfall | Mitigation
--------|------------
Solvent toxicity invalidates control (L5). | Pre-test solvent tolerances; use water-soluble formulations when possible.
Daily variation in pollen residues obscures “realism” (L9). | Pool multiple pollen collections or stagger dosing to mirror field spikes.
Genotype-specific LD50 spread (L4). | Include known source colonies; report queen lineage.
Co-infestation by varroa confounds pesticide effect (L7). | Apply balanced varroa treatments before trial start; monitor mite-drop weekly.

## 9. Example Experimental Matrix (adult oral chronic, thiamethoxam)
| Factor A: Pesticide Tier | A0 | A1 | A2 | A3 | A4 |
|--------------------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| ng bee⁻¹ d⁻¹ | 0 | 1 | 10 | 25 | 50 |
| Factor B: Nosema | B- | B- | B- | B- | B- |
| | B+ | B+ | B+ | B+ | B+ |
Total treatment groups = 5 × 2 = 10; with 3 replicates each → 30 cages.

## 10. Recommendations Beyond the Original Brief
1. **Omics + Phenotype Coupling**: Integrate untargeted metabolomics on haemolymph to detect early energy budget disruption.
2. **Behavioral Auto-tracking**: Use video or LiDAR to quantify trophallaxis rates and micro-movements often missed by RFID.
3. **Microbiome Profiling**: 16S rRNA sequencing to test whether pesticide tiers shift gut microbiome, potentially mediating immunocompetence.
4. **Subspecies Panel**: Include Africanised A. mellifera given L4’s differential sensitivity.
5. **Modelling Component**: Parameterise a DEB (Dynamic Energy Budget) model with measured intake/detox rates to project colony-scale outcomes.

## 11. Key Take-Away Concentration Ranges
• **Systemic insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam)**: 0.5 – 50 ng bee⁻¹ day⁻¹ spans “background” up to LD50.
• **Foliar organophosphates (chlorpyrifos)**: 5 – 500 ng bee⁻¹ contact; oral often limited by palatability.
• **In-hive acaricides (oxalic acid)**: 130 – 500 µg bee⁻¹ per treatment event.

These ranges meet three criteria: (i) encompass known field residues (L3, L9), (ii) bracket sub-lethal and lethal thresholds (L1, L4, L8), and (iii) allow exploration of synergistic interactions (L6, L7).

## 12. Concluding Synthesis
A *“realistic”* pesticide range cannot be a single number; it is a stratified continuum anchored by real-world residues, regulatory toxicology anchors, and biological thresholds. By triangulating multi-national residue surveys with experimentally determined NOEL/LD50 values and embedding co-stressors, the tiers proposed above deliver ecological authenticity while retaining statistical power. The nine learnings collated here collectively argue for:

1. **Lower-tier assays (OECD 213/214) remain foundational** but must be expanded to <10 % LD50 sub-lethal arenas.
2. **Synergies are the rule, not the exception**; integrated designs are indispensable.
3. **Landscape context changes everything**; experimental bees must be “lived” in real landscapes or provided pollen that mirrors those spikes.

Executing the protocol will generate a high-resolution dose-response surface from molecular biomarkers to colony outcomes, enabling both mechanistic insight and regulatory relevance.
