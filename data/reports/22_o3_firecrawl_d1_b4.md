## 1. Executive Summary

1. **Current Evidence Base** – Across 17 nutrition-related volunteer studies and broader volunteer management literature, no study has **causally** linked serving snacks to subsequent volunteer retention; the question is an un-addressed evidence gap.  
2. **Indirect Evidence** – Amenities spending (which usually bundles refreshments) shows very favorable cost–benefit ratios (Handy & Srinivasan 2004, VIVA ≈ 6.8 : 1) and practitioners already treat refreshments as *mission-critical program costs* rather than overhead.  
3. **Theoretical Mechanisms** – Snacks plausibly operate through (a) **immediate hedonic reward** (boosting affective commitment), (b) **social facilitation** (shared food → stronger group identity), (c) **reduced out-of-pocket cost** (“no brown-bagging”), and (d) **reciprocity signaling** (organisation cares → volunteer reciprocates).  
4. **Moderators & Confounds** – Social composition of the shift, presence/familiarity of experienced volunteers, task uncertainty, and concurrent non-food nudges (feedback, gamification) can amplify or mask any snack effect.  
5. **Recommended Next Step** – A two-arm, shift-level randomised controlled trial (RCT, 6–9 months) with blocked randomisation on weekday/weekend, shift size, and presence of ≥ 1 experienced volunteer. Primary outcome: *return within 30 days*; secondary: *12-month cumulative hours*.  
6. **Budget Guidance** – Allocate a dedicated line item ("Volunteer Support & Reimbursement: Snacks") at ~US$0.85–1.25 per volunteer-shift; even if retention rises by a modest 5 pp, the net present value of retained labour hours dwarfs snack cost by ≥3:1.

## 2. Context & Outstanding Scoping Questions

Before launching a study, three blanks from the scoping interview must be resolved:

| Information Gap | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|---------------|
| A. **Volunteer Context** (one-day, weekly, disaster, etc.) | Baseline retention expectations differ dramatically (episodic ≈ 20 % annual return vs ongoing ≈ 55–70 %). Sample-size and measurement horizon hinge on this. |
| B. **Causal vs. Observational** | Governs design choice (RCT vs difference-in-differences using historical sign-in logs). |
| C. **Snack Definition & Constraints** | Determines treatment fidelity, cost, logistics, and IRB/food-safety approvals. |

I proceed assuming an *ongoing, weekly* program (e.g., food-bank warehouse) with willingness to run a controlled trial and a per-shift snack budget ≤ $1.25/volunteer.

## 3. Literature & Evidence Map

### 3.1 Direct Evidence on Snacks → Retention  
• **Latif et al., 2021 systematic review (17 studies)** – No retention data reported.  
• **SNaX after-school trial, 2014** – Tracked child nutrition outcomes, not volunteer retention.  
**Conclusion:** *Direct causal evidence is non-existent.*

### 3.2 Adjacent Findings Informing Snack Hypothesis

1. **Amenities Cost–Benefit** – Hospital volunteer program (Handy & Srinivasan 2004) found each $1 in volunteer management (incl. refreshments) produced $6.84 in replacement labour value.  
2. **Experienced-Volunteer Spillover** – Tipnis et al. 2025 (n ≈ 49k) recorded a 52 % boost in next-month retention when at least one experienced volunteer served on the shift. Suggests any snack effect must be analysed net of social-skill spillovers.  
3. **Behavioural Nudges** – Mertins & Walter 2025 showed zero-cost feedback and voting nudges ↑ output 36–45 %; Evidence Action added gamified scoreboards & social recognition to lift retention from 66 → 82 %. Implication: food might be less cost-effective than purely behavioural levers.  
4. **Corporate Program Data** – Dollars-for-Doers & VTO programs link material support (cash, paid time) to 20–52 % lower turnover, signalling that modest tangible perks can matter, albeit in employment not volunteer settings.  
5. **Budget Norms** – Sector benchmarking treats snacks as program spend (<35 % overhead rule), so no reputational risk in allocating funds there.

### 3.3 Social-Dynamics Moderators

Tipnis’ *familiarity-retention trade-off*: experienced volunteers are only beneficial if they **aren’t** a tight clique. This cautions us to stratify randomisation by shift-level familiarity (proxy: number of prior co-shifts).

---

## 4. Theoretical Pathways of Influence

1. **Affective Commitment (Self-Determination Theory)** – Snacks contribute to *relatedness* and *comfort*, fostering intrinsic motivation.  
2. **Cost Offset / Economic Rational Actor** – Volunteers avoid spending/substituting a meal; reduces *psychic* and literal cost, improving cost-benefit calculus of returning.  
3. **Social Identity & Reciprocity** – Shared food rituals build group cohesion; receiving care prompts reciprocation.  
4. **Attention & Cueing Effects** – Visible snack station acts as a *salient reward cue*, reinforcing memory of positive shift experience.

A causal diagram (simplified):
```
Snacks  ─► Positive Affect ─┐
           Social Bond   ─┼─► Intention to Return ─► Observed Retention
Cost Offset──────────────┘
(Moderators: experienced volunteer presence, task uncertainty, prior familiarity, alternative perks)
```

## 5. Recommended Research Designs

### 5.1 Gold-Standard: Cluster-RCT at Shift Level

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Unit of Randomisation**: shift (not individual) | Avoid treatment contamination (everyone on shift sees snacks). |
| **Arms** | (1) Control – business-as-usual; (2) Treatment – snack provision. Optional Arm 3: snack + social nudge combo. |
| **Blocking Variables** | Day-of-week, shift size, presence of ≥ 1 experienced volunteer, seasonality (Q4 spike in charitable instincts). |
| **Sample Size** | For 80 % power to detect 5 percentage-point ↑ (e.g., 50 → 55 % 30-day return) with ICC≈0.05, need ~250 shifts/arm (≈2500 volunteer-shifts). |
| **Duration** | 3-month run-in + 6-month measurement horizon. |
| **Data** | Digital sign-in logs, snack cost ledger, demographic roster. |
| **Analysis** | Mixed-effects logistic regression: return_30d ~ snack + experienced + familiarity + interactions + fixed effects (block, month). |

### 5.2 Backup: Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
If true randomisation logistically impossible, stagger snack introduction across sites and employ DiD with site*month fixed effects. Caveat: parallel-trends assumption.

## 6. Intervention Specification

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Snack Type** | Single-serve items: fruit (bananas, apples), granola bars, 355 ml bottled water. Gluten-free and nut-free options to mitigate allergens. |
| **Cost Target** | US$0.85–1.25 per volunteer per shift (bulk warehouse pricing; includes compostable napkins). |
| **Logistics** | Delivered weekly via grocery wholesaler; volunteer lead sets up 15 min pre-shift. |
| **Fidelity Checks** | Random photo audits; count leftover items. |
| **Food Safety** | Only shelf-stable, individually wrapped; avoids health-dept permit hurdles. |
| **Visibility** | Snack station placed at sign-in desk to maximise salience. |

#### Optional Enhancements

1. **Personalisation** – name-tagged snack bags (identity cue).  
2. **Choice Architecture** – small sign: “Take a snack, fuel our impact!” (prompt reciprocity).  
3. **Social Media Loop** – Volunteers encouraged to post snack selfies with program hashtag (low-cost marketing externality).

## 7. Cost-Benefit Model

Assumptions (editable):

• Baseline return rate within 30 days = 50 %.  
• Hour value of volunteer labour = US$28.54 (Independent Sector 2024).  
• Average shift length = 3 h.  
• Average volunteer participates in 4 shifts over following year if they *do* return.  

Scenario: snack increases return probability by Δ = 5 pp.

### 7.1 Per-Volunteer Economics

• Expected hours gained = Δ × 4 shifts × 3 h = 0.6 h.  
• Value of hours = 0.6 h × $28.54 ≈ $17.12.  
• Snack cost per initial shift = $1.00.  
**Net Benefit** ≈ $16.12  ➔ **Benefit-Cost ≈ 17:1**.

Even with Δ = 1 pp effect, ratio still >3:1.

## 8. Measurement & Data Strategy

1. **Primary KPI** – Binary: volunteer returns **within 30 days** of focal shift.  
2. **Secondary** – (i) Total hours in 12 months, (ii) Self-reported satisfaction (1-7 Likert), (iii) Net Promoter Score as recruitment proxy.  
3. **Moderators** – presence of experienced volunteer, same-shift familiarity index (pairwise Jaccard based on past co-shifts), demographic variables, seasonal dummies.  
4. **Cost Tracking** – actual vs budget; donated in-kind snacks costed at fair-market value (per best-practice budgeting).  
5. **Data Governance** – PII minimised; unique volunteer IDs hashed; snack photos excluded from database.

## 9. Anticipated Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Crowding-out Intrinsic Motivation** | Low | Moderate | Keep snack modest in value; frame as *appreciation* not payment. |
| **Allergen Incidents** | Low | High | Provide ingredient list on site; default to nut-free. |
| **Cost Over-run** | Medium | Low | Monthly budget vs actual review; 15 % contingency reserve as per best-practice budgeting. |
| **Unequal Uptake** | Medium | Medium | Monitor photo audits; adjust placement/supply. |

## 10. Complementary or Alternative Low-Cost Levers (No Snacks Required)

1. **Performance Feedback** – Anonymous scoreboard (↑ productivity 36 %).  
2. **Voting on Cause Allocation** – Autonomy nudge (↑ output 45 %).  
3. **Gamified Leaderboards** – Evidence Action model (↑ retention 16 pp).  
4. **Social Recognition** – Digital badges; WhatsApp peer groups.  
5. **Shift Composition Engineering** – Reassign experienced volunteers to shifts lacking them (+14 % projected retention, Tipnis model).  

*These levers can run in factorial combination with snacks to test interaction effects.*

---

## 11. Ethical & Equity Considerations

• **Fairness** – Ensure control group is not deprived of basic needs; provision of plain water universally can be baseline.  
• **Diversity Sensitivity** – Offer culturally inclusive snack choices if volunteer base is diverse.  
• **Transparency** – Inform volunteers that refreshments program is being evaluated; waiver of consent may be possible with IRB, but opt-out channel advised.

---

## 12. Limitations

1. **External Validity** – Results from food-bank setting may not generalise to emergency response contexts (where snacks are embedded by default).  
2. **Hawthorne Effects** – Volunteers may alter behaviour simply due to being observed; including a ‘placebo’ arm (non-food gift) could parse this.  
3. **Short Horizon** – 30-day retention may not capture longer-term stickiness; hence track 12-month hours.  
4. **Interaction with Other Perks** – Corporate partnerships (VTO, dollars-for-doers) might swamp snack effect; stratify analyses accordingly.

## 13. Timeline & Next Actions

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 0–2  | Resolve scoping blanks (context, data availability, snack spec). |
| 3–4  | Draft IRB & food-safety paperwork; finalise budget (add 10–15 % contingency). |
| 5    | Procurement contracts; randomisation scheme coded. |
| 6–7  | Staff/volunteer orientation; pilot snack station; test data pipeline. |
| 8–20 | Main RCT roll-out (12 weeks). Interim check at week 14. |
| 26   | Close-out survey & retention extraction. |
| 30   | Analysis & board presentation. |

## 14. Strategic Implications & Speculative Outlook *(flagged)*

• **If snacks show even a *modest* uplift (≥3 pp)**, scaling to all shifts becomes a near-certain positive-ROI move under any reasonable labour valuation.  
• **Contrarian Scenario** – Snacks fail but social-identity nudges work; pivot funds to low-cost behavioural levers, highlighting an emerging trend that *intangibles beat tangibles* for volunteer motivation.  
• **Long-view (Speculative)** – AI-assisted shift scheduling could algorithmically optimise mix of experienced volunteers and snack placement to maximise retention at individual level by 2027.

---

## 15. Recommendations

1. **Run the RCT** – The evidence gap is glaring; you have the operational scale (≥5000 volunteer-shifts per year) to answer it definitively.  
2. **Bundle Data Collection with Social-Dynamics Metrics** – Leverage the existing sign-in system to compute familiarity indices; this yields broader insights than snacks alone.  
3. **Maintain Budget Discipline** – Track snacks under a dedicated program line; aim for <2 % of total program spend, congruent with sector norms.  
4. **Plan for Scale** – Negotiate bulk snack pricing with wholesalers now; price lock benefits even if RCT positive.  
5. **Publish Results Openly** – Fill the literature void; potential SSIR or *Nonprofit & Voluntary Sector Quarterly* article.
