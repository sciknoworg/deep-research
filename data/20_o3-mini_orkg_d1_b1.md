# Final Report: Effects of Green Roofs on Urban Insect Biodiversity

## Introduction

Urbanization profoundly alters biodiversity, fragmenting habitats and diminishing local species richness. Green roofs have emerged as a promising intervention, offering not only energy savings and stormwater management, but also potential ecological benefits by serving as urban refuges for various insect taxa. This report synthesizes multi-site research outcomes, spanning studies conducted in Geneva, the Portland metropolitan area, and Zurich, to provide an in-depth assessment of green roofs' effects on urban insect biodiversity. In addressing both overall biodiversity metrics and functional guild dynamics, we explore how roof design, plant composition, and surrounding landscape context collectively influence insect communities, focusing on general metrics as well as specific taxa such as pollinators, beetles, and diverse arthropod groups.

## Overview of Research Objectives and Methodologies

The overarching inquiry behind these studies was to determine the efficacy and limitations of green roofs as urban habitats, with a two-pronged emphasis:

1. **Taxonomic and Functional Diversity**: Examining overall insect biodiversity metrics, with particular attention to functional guilds such as pollinators (wild bees, hoverflies), predators, detritivores, and specifically, beetle communities.
2. **Contextual and Temporal Impacts**: While the studies vary in temporal scale, a combination of short-term ecological impacts (e.g., immediate colonization and resource utilization) and longer-term succession patterns (e.g., continuous community reassembly) were considered, with particular emphasis on the latter in Zurich where connectivity and plant richness drove diversity.

Across sites, the primary methodologies employed included direct sampling techniques (e.g., emergence trap studies in Geneva), comparative surveys of green roof versus ground-level sites (Zurich), and detailed analyses of green roof design parameters (Portland). The comparative approach allowed researchers to parse out how variations in green roof design—spanning substrate heterogeneity, plant cover and species richness, height profiles, and the percentage of attractive flora—affect insect communities differently across urban contexts.

## Detailed Learnings from Site-Specific Studies

### 1. Geneva: Urban Pollinator Habitat Functionality

**Key Findings:**

- **Pollinator Diversity:** Studies conducted in Geneva in 2017 demonstrated that green roofs, when optimized with a high percentage of attractive plant species and proximate additional green spaces, can serve as effective supplemental habitats for urban pollinators. Specifically, emergence trap studies recorded an impressive diversity, with 62 wild bee species and 10 hoverfly species documented.
- **Resource vs. Nesting Quality:** Although the green roofs provided abundant food resources, they were less effective as nesting habitats. This suggests that while these roofs are valuable in sustaining pollinator populations by enhancing forage opportunities, complementary measures might be required to ensure the availability of suitable nesting substrates.
- **Landscape Connectivity:** The research underscored the critical role of surrounding green areas. Increased connectivity with adjacent vegetated areas enhanced the colonization and persistence of wild bee communities on the rooftops.

**Implications:**

These findings indicate that for urban pollinator management, green roof projects should integrate not only plant species selection aimed at nectar and pollen provision, but also design strategies that enhance connectivity with other green urban spaces and, if possible, include features conducive to nesting such as varied substrate textures or dedicated nesting zones.

### 2. Portland: Beetle Community Dynamics and Roof Design Parameters

**Key Findings:**

- **Influence of Design Features:** In the Portland metropolitan area, studies elucidated the crucial role of green roof design in shaping beetle community structures. Biodiverse roofs—with heterogeneous substrate composition, greater plant species richness, higher percent plant cover, and increased plant height—exhibited an enhanced capacity to support beetle diversity. Data revealed that these biodiverse roofs harbored roughly 20% native beetle species and an average of seven trophic groups.
- **Stormwater vs. Biodiverse Roofs:** Comparatively, stormwater-oriented roofs, often designed for hydrological performance rather than ecological function, were associated with only about 5% native species presence and averaged three trophic groups, indicating a more limited ecological function.

**Implications:**

The comparative analysis in Portland emphasizes that a deliberate consideration of design features can markedly enhance the ecological utility of green roofs. Specifically, biodiverse design elements promote the establishment of native beetle populations, contributing to urban ecosystem stability and potentially aiding in pest regulation through natural predation. Urban planners should consider integrating multi-tiered roof designs that incorporate both stormwater and biodiverse management objectives to achieve dual benefits.

### 3. Zurich: Comparative Studies on Arthropod Community Structure

**Key Findings:**

- **Species Richness vs. Functional Diversity:** A comprehensive study in Zurich, which compared 40 green roofs with 40 ground-level sites, found that while overall species richness of arthropods was higher at ground-level sites, the functional diversity—evaluated amongst varied taxa including Apidae (bees), Curculionidae (weevils), Araneae (spiders), and Carabidae (ground beetles)—did not significantly differ between green roofs and ground habitats. This suggests that despite a numerical deficit in species, green roofs are functionally compensating by harboring ecologically complementary guilds.
- **Driving Factors:** Enhanced connectivity between green roofs and greater plant species richness emerged as central drivers of arthropod diversity. Notably, factors such as substrate depth, roof height, and overall area, while relevant for other performance metrics (e.g., thermal or hydrological), were less critical in determining arthropod functional diversity.

**Implications:**

The Zurich study underscores the importance of landscape-level planning in urban biodiversity strategies. By promoting connectivity—either through clustered green roofs or through integration with ground-level green spaces—and by ensuring diverse plant communities, urban design can facilitate the assembly of functionally robust insect communities. This finding is particularly salient for cities aiming for ecosystem services that transcend mere species counts, emphasizing the resilience and interactivity of urban ecological networks.

## Synthesis and Generalized Conclusions

### A. Design Parameters and Habitat Quality

Across the three studies, a unifying theme is that the ecological impact of green roofs is strongly contingent upon the design choices made at the planning phase. Several critical design parameters have emerged:

- **Plant Species Richness:** Ensuring a high diversity of plants not only attracts a broader array of insect species but also creates diverse microhabitats that can facilitate niche partitioning among insects.
- **Substrate and Structural Variation:** Heterogeneous substrates, which support differential moisture retention and microclimatic conditions, are imperative for supporting diverse insect communities, particularly for species sensitive to abiotic conditions.
- **Connectivity with Ground-Level Green Spaces:** The surrounding habitat matrix influences colonization rates. Green roofs that are interconnected with other urban green spaces can sustain higher biodiversity by acting as part of a broader ecological network.

### B. Functional Ecosystem Services

The studies highlight that while raw species counts might be lower on green roofs compared to ground-level habitats, the functional roles of the insects present are preserved. In practice, this means that green roofs can maintain ecological processes such as pollination, predation, and detritivory, which are essential for urban ecosystem functioning. Increasing functional diversity might even represent a more sustainable goal than boosting simple species richness, as it assures that key ecological processes continue to operate even in fragmented urban settings.

### C. Urban Biodiversity and Novel Approaches

While the current body of research provides a robust understanding of green roofs' ecological potential, several emerging avenues could further enhance their effectiveness:

- **Incorporation of Artificial Nesting Structures:** Given that some green roofs primarily provide foraging rather than nesting resources (as seen in Geneva), the deliberate installation of nesting aids (e.g., bee hotels, bare soil patches) could further augment pollinator sustainability.
- **Dynamic Roof Management:** Ongoing management practices such as periodic replanting, controlled disturbances, and adaptive watering regimes could simulate natural succession processes, thereby promoting long-term biodiversity and community stability.
- **Integration of Technological Tools:** The application of remote sensing, ecological modeling, and IoT-based monitoring could enable real-time assessments of green roof performance and early detection of shifts in insect community composition. This proactive approach might allow urban ecologists to tailor management interventions dynamically.
- **Cross-Modal Urban Green Infrastructure:** Future research might also explore the synergistic effects of integrating green roofs with other urban greening practices (e.g., vertical gardens, urban wetlands) to create hyper-connected ecosystems that multiply biodiversity benefits.

## Potential Limitations and Future Research Directions

Even though these studies collectively enhance our understanding of urban insect biodiversity on green roofs, some limitations warrant further investigation:

- **Temporal Scales:** Longitudinal studies are needed to fully understand the successional dynamics over decades, as most studies have concentrated on short- to mid-term outcomes.
- **Taxon-Specific Responses:** While broad groupings (pollinators, beetles, arthropods) have been informative, species-specific studies could unravel nuances in habitat preferences, especially for rare or specialist species.
- **Climate Variability:** As urban centers face increasing climate variability, research should assess how different climatic conditions interact with roof design to influence insect community dynamics over time.

Future research should integrate these dimensions to more holistically evaluate the sustainable management of urban biodiversity within the context of rapid urbanization and climate change.

## Conclusion

The convergent evidence from Geneva, Portland, and Zurich supports the conclusion that green roofs can be instrumental in enhancing urban insect biodiversity. They function as critical nodes within urban ecological networks, offering valuable ecosystem services beyond simple habitat provision. Key factors such as plant species richness, structural heterogeneity, and connectivity with surrounding green spaces are central to maximizing these benefits. Additionally, while quantitative differences exist (e.g., ground-level sites showing greater species richness), the functional equivalence between green roofs and traditional green spaces suggests that carefully designed and managed green roofs can contribute significantly to urban ecosystem resilience.

Urban planners and ecologists should therefore consider these findings in future green infrastructure projects, with a view to employing adaptive management and multi-functional design principles. As cities continue to grow, the strategic deployment and management of green roofs will be crucial in maintaining urban biodiversity and sustaining the essential ecological processes that underpin healthy urban environments.
