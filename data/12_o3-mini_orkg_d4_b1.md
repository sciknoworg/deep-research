# Buckthorn Invasion and its Impact on Biodiversity: A Comprehensive Synthesis

This report synthesizes numerous research findings on the invasion of European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) in North American ecosystems, elucidating both immediate and gradual effects on aboveground and belowground biodiversity. Drawing on diverse methodologies, including removal experiments, paired‐point frameworks, remote sensing, and statistical modeling, we provide a detailed analysis of how buckthorn invasion alters native flora, fauna, and ecosystem processes. This comprehensive account integrates results from controlled manipulative experiments, observational studies, and modeling efforts, revealing a complex interplay between pre-existing environmental conditions and invader-induced changes.

## 1. Introduction

European buckthorn has been identified as a particularly aggressive invader in North American woodlands. Its proliferation has been documented in various geographic settings, notably in the Chicago-area and parts of the Midwest and Northeast. The invasion is characterized by the formation of dense, monotypic stands that lead to cascading effects on native communities. The initial impacts are primarily visible in the aboveground community, where native plant assemblages, pollinators, and detritivores are markedly reduced. Simultaneously, belowground processes—ranging from soil nutrient cycling to microbial community dynamics—experience alterations that may either predispose an ecosystem to invasion or result as a consequence thereof.

In this report, we dissect the two-fold impact of buckthorn invasion—immediate aboveground biodiversity losses versus longer-term belowground modifications. Both scales of influence are elaborated upon, with discussions examining whether the invader is a primary driver of ecosystem change versus a beneficiary of pre-existing abiotic conditions.

## 2. Aboveground Impacts: Declines in Native Flora and Fauna

### 2.1 Immediate Effects on Plant Communities

A recurrent finding across multiple studies is the rapid decline in native plant species richness following buckthorn invasion. Removal experiments, which compared open (buckthorn-absent), native plant-dominated, and closed (buckthorn-dense) treatments, consistently illustrate a reduction in indigenous flora in invaded sites. The formation of dense, monotypic stands by buckthorn monopolizes light and space, competitively excluding native species and thereby reducing community diversity.

### 2.2 Consequences for Pollinators and Detritivores

The suppression of native plant diversity naturally extends to impact associated fauna. Specifically, pollinator communities such as bees have been documented to experience significant declines due to reduced floral diversity and decreased availability of forage. Moreover, leaf-litter beetles—the detritivores that play a critical role in nutrient cycling and decomposition—exhibit lowered abundances in buckthorn-infested areas. The immediate elimination of these functionally important taxa disrupts existing food web dynamics and diminishes ecosystem resilience.

### 2.3 Favoring of Certain Fauna: The Case of Mammalian Response

Interestingly, while many native taxa are negatively impacted, species such as mice appear to thrive under buckthorn invasion. Increased mouse populations in closed buckthorn stands highlight a shift in community composition. The abundance of cover and changes in microhabitat conditions, such as altered light regimes and increased understory density, may create a niche that facilitates the proliferation of certain opportunistic species, further restructuring the local ecosystem.

## 3. Belowground Impacts: Soil Dynamics and Microbial Community Shifts

### 3.1 Soil Nutrient Alterations and Decomposition Dynamics

A paired-point framework study in Chicago-area woodlands provides compelling evidence that buckthorn invasion is associated with notable shifts in belowground processes. Prior to invasion, sites with specific soil characteristics—such as higher moisture, pH, total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), ammonium (NH4⁺-N), and calcium (Ca²⁺)—tend to be more susceptible. Following invasion, buckthorn further accelerates leaf-litter accumulation and decomposition. The acceleration of decomposition alters nutrient cycling, especially pointed out by shifting patterns in spring soil nitrate (NO3⁻-N) levels. These changes have implications for overall soil fertility and subsequent plant regrowth dynamics.

### 3.2 Microbial Community Composition

The effects of buckthorn on microbial communities, albeit subtle, have been documented using ARISA and qPCR techniques across numerous sites. While changes in fungal communities have not been significant, bacterial communities—particularly those associated with the archaeal amoA gene—exhibit modest but significant shifts proportional to buckthorn severity. This suggests that while the invader's impact on belowground biota is nuanced, detectable alterations exist that could have longer-term consequences on microbial-mediated processes such as nitrogen mineralization and decomposition.

### 3.3 Interplay Between Pre-Existing Conditions and Invader-Driven Changes

The role of pre-existing soil conditions in either promoting invasion or reacting to buckthorn presence underscores the dual nature of its impact. On one hand, specific abiotic conditions appear to predispose woodlands to invasion; on the other, the invader modifies these conditions in ways that can amplify ecosystem shifts. This complex feedback loop challenges management efforts and suggests that interventions need to address both inherent site vulnerabilities and invader-induced dynamics.

## 4. Methodologies and Approaches in Buckthorn Research

### 4.1 Comparative Removal Experiments

Comparative removal experiments have been crucial in isolating the direct effects of buckthorn on native plant and animal communities. By systematically removing buckthorn in controlled plots, researchers have quantified immediate changes in species richness and faunal abundance. These experiments provide robust evidence for the immediate aboveground impacts of invasion.

### 4.2 Paired-Point Frameworks

The application of novel paired-point frameworks in fields such as the Chicago-area woodlands has allowed researchers to correlate invasion severity with specific soil parameters. These frameworks elucidate both pre-invasion soil conditions—such as moisture and nutrient content—and post-invasion modifications. The result is a more holistic understanding of belowground ecosystem changes.

### 4.3 Remote Sensing and Imaging Spectroscopy

Remote sensing methodologies, specifically imaging spectroscopy, have been deployed in biodiversity experiments at BioDIV in Cedar Creek, MN, and Wood River Nature Conservancy, NE. These techniques allow for the remote estimation of aboveground vegetation characteristics (e.g., biomass, cover, chemical composition, structural traits) as proxies for belowground processes such as soil organic C/N concentrations, microbial biomass, and enzyme activity. This integrative approach demonstrates that aboveground measurements can be predictive of subsurface process alterations triggered by buckthorn invasion.

### 4.4 Statistical and Regression Analyses

Advanced regression models, such as the two-phase, zero-inflated approaches developed in Wisconsin, have been key to estimating buckthorn presence and abundance using landscape and stand-level predictors (e.g., stem density, species diversity, mean DBH, distance to houses, solar irradiation, percent silt, and geographic latitude). These models not only validate observational findings but also facilitate predictive mapping of invasion severity based on environmental variables.

## 5. Spatial Variability and Environmental Preconditioning

### 5.1 Site-Specific Abiotic Factors

Not all woodland sites respond uniformly to buckthorn invasion. Factors such as canopy openness, the percentage of bare soil, and inherent soil nutrient levels significantly correlate with the abundance and severity of buckthorn stands. Regions with these pre-existing conditions are more vulnerable and exhibit higher invasion rates, stressing the importance of local environmental context in managing biodiversity impacts.

### 5.2 Integration of Ecosystem Scales

It is increasingly clear that managing buckthorn invasion requires an integrated approach encompassing both aboveground biotic communities and the belowground physical and chemical soil environment. The interplay between preset abiotic conditions and invader-induced shifts points to a dual-scale process: one wherein immediate biodiversity losses aboveground are coupled with slower, but equally transformative, soil nutrient cycling modifications belowground.

## 6. Ecological Implications and Management Strategies

### 6.1 Immediate Versus Long-Term Effects

The evidence suggests that buckthorn invasion triggers rapid declines in native plant and faunal communities, a phenomenon that is readily visible and measurable. In contrast, alterations in soil nutrient cycling and microbial composition might be more gradual, compounded by the invader's modulation of existing soil properties. Distinguishing between these temporal scales is vital for implementing effective management and restoration initiatives.

### 6.2 Potential Management Interventions

An integrated management approach should consider:

- **Targeted Removal and Restoration:** Implementation of removal experiments combined with restoration efforts, aiming to re-establish native plant species can help reverse aboveground biodiversity losses. However, such efforts must be coupled with soil remediation practices.

- **Soil Amendment and Nutrient Management:** Given that buckthorn invasion both exploits and modifies pre-existing soil conditions, management strategies might include soil amendments to modify moisture, pH, and nutrient levels, thereby creating less favorable conditions for buckthorn establishment and proliferation.

- **Monitoring and Early Warning Systems:** Utilizing remote sensing and imaging spectroscopy methodologies to monitor vegetation traits and correlate them with belowground processes can help in the early detection of potentially vulnerable sites. This proactive management would allow for pre-emptive interventions before buckthorn fully establishes.

- **Spatially Explicit Risk Modeling:** Advanced regression and landscape modeling can identify high-risk areas based on abiotic factors and current invasion patterns. These models can serve as tools for resource allocation and prioritization of control efforts.

### 6.3 Anticipating Future Dynamics

It is critical to acknowledge that buckthorn invasion may generate a feedback loop, wherein initial soil modifications foster conditions more conducive to further invasion. This dynamic complicates long-term management. Adaptive management plans that continuously monitor both biotic and abiotic changes will be essential as the ecosystem responds to intervention efforts over time.

## 7. Discussion: Buckthorn as a Driver Versus a Beneficiary of Ecosystem Change

A central debate in buckthorn research lies in discerning whether the invader is primarily a driver of changes or if it merely benefits from pre-existing conditions. Evidence shows that many buckthorn-infested areas already have soil conditions—elevated moisture, specific nutrient levels, and higher pH—that promote invasion. Once established, however, buckthorn accelerates processes such as leaf-litter accumulation and decomposition, thereby reinforcing soil changes. This duality suggests a complex ecological scenario where buckthorn both exploits favorable inherent conditions and actively modifies its environment to further destabilize native biodiversity.

The differentiation between immediate aboveground impacts (e.g., rapid native plant and faunal declines) and more gradual belowground modifications (e.g., nutrient cycling and microbial community shifts) underscores the need for multi-scalar research and management. Future research could further elucidate the relative contributions of these drivers versus beneficiaries through long-term monitoring and experimental manipulations across diverse ecosystems.

## 8. Conclusions

The invasion of European buckthorn in North American woodlands represents a multidimensional threat to ecosystem integrity. Immediate impacts include the reduction of native plant species, which in turn diminishes critical pollinator and detritivore populations. These aboveground losses cascade into altered trophic interactions and food web structures, occasionally benefiting opportunistic species such as mice. Meanwhile, belowground effects—although initially influenced by pre-existing soil conditions—are exacerbated by the invader’s presence through accelerated decomposition and shifts in nutrient cycling and microbial community composition.

Effective management must adopt a dual-focus strategy that addresses both the rapid aboveground disruptions and the slower, yet significant, belowground modifications. By integrating targeted removal, soil management, remote sensing for early detection, and spatial risk modeling, conservation practitioners can design adaptive, ecosystem-scale interventions to mitigate the long-term biodiversity impacts of buckthorn invasion.

As research continues and methodologies evolve, understanding the nuanced interplay between pre-existing site conditions and invader-driven impacts will be crucial in formulating strategies aimed at restoring native biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem resilience in the face of invasive species challenges.
