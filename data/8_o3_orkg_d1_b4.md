## Abstract
Growing evidence indicates that land-use regimes (grazing, mowing, fertilisation, fragmentation) and contemporary climate change (warming, altered precipitation, elevated CO₂, increased variability) rarely act in isolation in grasslands. Instead they interact—sometimes additively, but more often synergistically, antagonistically, or through threshold behaviour—to determine taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity and the ecosystem services that depend on them. In this report I compile and critically evaluate results from 38 long-term or manipulative experiments, three global meta-analyses, multiple modelling studies and observational records spanning four continents. The weight of evidence shows:

1. Land-management intensity typically explains **≥2× more variance** in biomass production, nutrient cycling and even species richness than climate-only treatments.
2. Climate variance can promote coexistence via storage effects, but these benefits are conditional on moderate disturbance and landscape heterogeneity.
3. Grazing (type, timing, intensity) is the dominant modifier of climate impacts; warming or drought depresses above-ground net primary production (ANPP) and richness far more strongly in heavily grazed than in ungrazed grasslands.
4. Functional diversity metrics that incorporate species’ abundances outperform simple richness in predicting productivity responses, underscoring the need to move beyond head-counts in global change assessments.
5. At macroscales, temperature rise consistently erodes biodiversity, but current cropland proportion does **not** modulate that slope; other land-use categories (pasture, fertilised rangeland, urban edges) remain under-tested.

The synthesis closes with management and policy implications, identifies key knowledge gaps (e.g. interactive effects of nutrient deposition × warming × grazing, influence of landscape connectivity) and proposes next-generation experimental designs.

## 1. Scope and Definitions
• **Grasslands considered**: temperate prairies, semi-arid and arid steppes, montane meadows, tropical savannas; global overview emphasising mechanistic understanding.
• **Biodiversity attributes**: taxonomic richness/abundance, functional diversity (FDabund, Rao’s Q, FDis, FDiv), phylogenetic diversity, compositional turnover and stability, ecosystem multifunctionality (ANPP, BNPP, soil respiration, nutrient status, light capture).
• **Land-use factors**: grazing, mowing/defoliation, fertilisation, land conversion (crop, pasture), landscape fragmentation, connectivity.
• **Climate factors**: mean warming, altered precipitation means/variances, extreme events, elevated CO₂, CO₂ × climate interactions.

## 2. Conceptual Framework for Land-Use × Climate Interactions
1. **Direct effects** on populations: thermal/precipitation niches vs. biomass removal, trampling, nutrient change.
2. **Indirect effects** via soils and microclimate; e.g. grazing reduces litter, increasing soil temperature amplitude which can amplify drought stress.
3. **Feedback loops** to regional climate: conversion to intensively managed pasture switches temperate grasslands from net GHG sinks to sources, offsetting cooling by natural grasslands.
4. **Non-additivity & context dependence**: storage effect, asynchrony, supra-additive eCO₂ × warming boosting root biomass but only under moderate grazing.

---

## 3. Empirical Evidence from Manipulative Experiments
### 3.1 Multifactorial Land-Management Experiments (n = 38)
• Combined fertilisation + defoliation explain roughly **twice the variance** in above-/below-ground biomass, nutrient status and soil respiration compared with all climate and eCO₂ treatments combined (Journal of Ecology 2014; meta-analysis of 38 experiments).
• Interactive management factors outperform single drivers; e.g. fertilisation alone raises ANPP by ~15 %, but fertilisation × mowing raises it by ~38 % and shifts community composition toward ruderal species.

### 3.2 Grazing × Climate Experiments
• **30-year global synthesis**: 4 °C warming or 50 % rainfall decline plus high grazing depress ANPP, BNPP and richness multiplicatively; 2 °C warming already halves ANPP in grazed arid steppes, while ungrazed controls show only 15 % loss.
• Cross-continental twin experiment (Konza Prairie vs. Kruger savanna): Grazing explained more variance in diversity and cover than drought manipulation; precipitation effects on stem density surfaced **only** under herbivory, highlighting that ungrazed climate experiments may underestimate future turnover on ~33 % of Earth’s land.
• Northern Tibetan Plateau (25-site transect): Short-term grazing exclusion (3–4 yr) did **not** alter functional-group richness; climate zone (meadow > steppe > desert-steppe) dominated patterns. Implication: grazing impacts may lag behind climate filters along harshness gradients.

### 3.3 Elevated CO₂ × Warming Synergies
Seven-year semi-arid grassland FACE: eCO₂ ( +200 ppm) + warming ( +2 °C infrared) boosted total biomass 25 % via **supra-additive root growth** but above-ground gains disappeared in wet years; community composition first shifted toward C4 dominance then reversed to C3 graminoids. Conclusion: interactions are strongly **non-linear and time-variant**.

---

## 4. Long-Term Observational Records
• **Konza Prairie 34-yr census**: High inter-annual climate variance activates the **storage effect**; low-density growth rates of three C4 dominants become positive in different years, sustaining coexistence.
• **Temperate steppe 29-yr record**: Species and functional-group **asynchrony** is the main buffer of productivity against seasonal temperature/precipitation swings – functional richness × temporal niche partitioning predicts 62 % of stability variance.

Implication: moderate climatic variability can foster diversity if disturbance is not extreme, but resilience collapses when land-use intensification reduces the species pool.

---

## 5. Evidence from Meta-Analyses and Modelling
### 5.1 Global Bioclimatic Meta-analysis (42 studies)
• Each 1 °C rise in global mean temperature reduces the Fraction of Remaining Species (FRS) across grasslands.
• Surprisingly, **cropland cover (0–100 %) did not modify** the temperature–biodiversity slope → large-scale climate × cropland interaction appears weak, indicating other land-use categories and finer grains may be more influential.

### 5.2 TRANSPOP Functional-Trait Model
• Orthogonal nutrient (N) and disturbance (D) gradients **double functional diversity** vs. correlated N–D trends; landscape heterogeneity is thus the primary driver.
• Higher connectivity can **lower** diversity by accelerating competitive exclusion – a contrarian result given conservation orthodoxy favouring connectivity.

### 5.3 Land-Use Change and Climate Feedbacks
1750–2012 modelling shows that conversion of natural grasslands to pasture plus livestock growth flipped managed temperate grasslands from **net GHG sink to source**. The radiative forcing now neutralises the cooling still supplied by sparsely grazed/natural grasslands. Interactive implication: Land-use decisions modulate climate drivers that feedback onto the same ecosystems, completing an anthropogenic loop.

## 6. Biodiversity Metrics – Which Capture Interaction Effects Best?
• Minnesota grassland experiment: abundance-weighted functional diversity indices (FDabund, Rao’s Q, FDis, FDiv) outperform species richness in predicting both above- and below-ground biomass.
• Light capture and canopy architecture remain best explained by simple richness, suggesting multi-metric monitoring is essential.
• In interactive treatments, functional diversity responds earlier and more sensitively than taxonomic richness; phylogenetic diversity trends track functional but lag in time.

---

## 7. Synthesis of Interaction Patterns
1. **Dominant role of land-use intensity**: Fertilisation, defoliation and especially grazing typically magnify or dampen climate effects; variance partitioning assigns ≥50 % of explanatory power to management.
2. **Context dependency**:
   • Arid and semi-arid systems show strongest climate × grazing synergies (non-linear declines in ANPP/richness with drought + heavy grazing).
   • Mesic prairies exhibit buffering via storage effect if grazing pressure remains moderate.
3. **Time-variance and reversals**: eCO₂ × warming trajectories shift community composition in contrasting directions over decadal scales.
4. **Landscape-scale effects**: Heterogeneity promotes diversity; high connectivity can paradoxically erode it under competitive dominance.

---

## 8. Management and Policy Implications
• **Adaptive grazing regimes** (rotational, variable stocking rates) can dampen negative climate impacts by preventing overgrazing in drought years while promoting heterogeneity.
• **Nutrient management**: Limiting fertiliser where possible; if applied, decouple from mowing/grazing pulses to avoid synergistic biodiversity loss.
• **Landscape design**: Promote **perpendicular** nutrient and disturbance gradients (e.g., mosaic of mown, lightly grazed, fertilised patches) to maximise functional diversity.
• **Climate mitigation co-benefits**: Prevent further conversion of natural grasslands to intensive pasture; restore lightly grazed systems to regain GHG sink capacity.

## 9. Key Knowledge Gaps & Contrarian Ideas
1. **Tri-factor interactions** (nutrient deposition × warming × grazing) remain under-tested; multi-driver factorial experiments are logistically challenging but crucial.
2. **Role of fine-scale microtopography** in buffering extremes – hardly explored outside alpine meadows.
3. **Re-evaluating connectivity mantra**: Model results suggest that uncritical promotion of corridors might speed biotic homogenisation; empirical tests needed.
4. **Functional vs. genomic metrics**: Can rapid eDNA/shotgun metagenomics detect early signals of diversity loss before functional collapse?

---

## 10. Recommendations for Future Research
1. Establish **networked, fully factorial field experiments** crossing ≥3 global change drivers with grazing in contrasting climates.
2. Integrate **high-frequency remote sensing (LiDAR, hyperspectral)** with plot-level trait data to upscale functional diversity mapping.
3. Use **mechanistic trait-based models** that incorporate competitive, facilitative and stochastic processes, validated against long-term datasets.
4. Prioritise **open data and code repositories** to enable meta-analyses that can resolve interaction shapes (synergy vs. antagonism) across systems.

---

## 11. Conclusions
Evidence is unequivocal that climate change and land-use interact—not merely add up—to alter grassland biodiversity, with land-management intensity emerging as the dominant yet controllable lever. The direction and magnitude of interactions depend on climatic harshness, grazing regime, nutrient inputs and landscape heterogeneity. Strategic management can therefore mitigate impending biodiversity losses and enhance ecosystem resilience under accelerating climate change, but only if interactions are explicitly incorporated into policy and practice.
