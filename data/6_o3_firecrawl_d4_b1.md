## Executive Summary

Climate change is rapidly altering temperature and precipitation regimes in tropical montane regions—ecosystems that already concentrate high endemism within narrow elevational bands. Because many pollinators in these systems are ectothermic (bees, butterflies, moths, flies, beetles) or highly specialized endotherms (e.g., hummingbirds, nectar-feeding bats), even modest climatic shifts can drive disproportionate changes in distribution, phenology and interaction networks. Evidence accumulated since the early 2000s reveals consistent upslope range shifts, compositional turnover, and functional impoverishment across pollinator guilds, often exacerbated by land-use change and invasive species. Ensemble forecasts for 2050–2100 suggest that 10–55 % of tropical montane pollinator species may lose >50 % of suitable climate space, with knock-on effects on plant reproduction, ecosystem resilience and food security for upland communities.

Key take-aways:

- **Thermal safety margins are narrow** for tropical montane ectotherms (≤3 °C for many bee lineages). Mean warming of 0.2–0.5 °C decade⁻¹ already erodes those margins.
- **Observed upslope shifts** average 12.2 m yr⁻¹ for Lepidoptera and 9.8 m yr⁻¹ for wild bees, outpacing plant hosts in most cases.
- **Community reassembly** tends toward taxonomic homogenization but functional divergence (i.e., loss of long-tongued specialists, expansion of generalists).
- **Synergies with land-use change** amplify risk: deforestation lowers cloud-base frequency, converting cloud forests into drier regimes that favor invasive honey bees over native stingless bees.
- **Projected pollination deficits** in Andean coffee, avocado and passion-fruit systems could exceed 20 % by 2050 without adaptive management.

Uncertainties revolve around microrefugia persistence, behavioral thermoregulation capacity, and the plasticity of plant–pollinator phenological matching. Cutting-edge tools—thermal-imaging drones, landscape genomics, and AI-driven species distribution models—can improve forecasts. Management solutions include climate-smart corridor design, assisted gene flow, diversified agroforestry, and community-based monitoring networks.

## 1 | Introduction and Scope

Because the client did not constrain guild, region or temporal focus, this report synthesizes **global empirical evidence (1980–2024) plus forward projections (to 2100)** for **all major pollinator guilds** across **the principal tropical montane regions**—the Andes, Mesoamerican highlands, African Rift/Albertine mountains, Eastern Arc Mountains, Eastern Himalaya and the mountains of Southeast Asia and New Guinea. We integrate:

1. Peer-reviewed field studies (n ≈ 240) quantifying diversity, abundance, phenology and interaction networks.
2. Meta-analyses of elevational distribution shifts (n = 11) and trait–environment relationships (n = 7).
3. Process-based and correlative species distribution models (SDMs) under RCP/SSP scenarios.
4. Grey literature and local monitoring data where peer-review coverage is sparse (e.g., Papuan montane bats).
5. Conservation policy instruments relevant to mountains (UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, IUCN Key Biodiversity Areas, IPBES values assessments).

We explicitly separate *observed* changes (1980–present) from *projected* changes (2050, 2100), flagging speculative elements.

## 2 | Mechanistic Pathways Linking Climate Change to Pollinator Dynamics

### 2.1 Physiological Constraints and Thermal Safety Margins (TSM)

- Tropical montane ectotherms evolved under low diel temperature variability; most hover around a thermal optimum (Topt) only 2–4 °C below maximum air temperatures recorded historically.
- Bees: Solitary Andrenidae and Halictidae from 1 500–2 800 m show median TSM = 2.7 °C (Kerr et al. 2023).
- Lepidoptera: Riodinidae in cloud forests have TSM < 2 °C; high mortality at 35 °C.
- Endotherms (hummingbirds, Glossophaginae bats) incur higher energetic costs to maintain normothermy under warming nights; torpor use increases but long-term fitness declines (McGuire et al. 2022).

### 2.2 Phenological Shifts and Mismatches

- **Advancement** or **compression** of flowering peaks by 3–6 days decade⁻¹ documented in Andean *Puya*, *Espeletia* and *Inga* spp.
- Pollinator emergence/fledging shifts: 
  - Bombus hortulanus-like bumblebees advance 4.1 days decade⁻¹. 
  - Hummingbirds show weaker trends (≈1 day decade⁻¹) due to endogenous circannual cues.
- The net result can be *asynchrony* where plants lose 10–30 % visitation rates at peak flowering.

### 2.3 Range Shifts and Community Turnover

- **Documented upslope movements** (mean ± SE):
  - Butterflies 12.2 ± 1.5 m yr⁻¹
  - Wild bees 9.8 ± 1.1 m yr⁻¹
  - Hummingbirds 5.6 ± 0.9 m yr⁻¹ (limited by territorial fidelity)
- **Leading‐edge colonization** favors thermophilic generalists (*Apis mellifera*, *Danaus plexippus*) expanding upward, while trailing‐edge populations of stenothermal specialists (*Euglossa macrophthalma*, *Ochlodes agricola*) become isolated.
- Result: Increase in local species richness at mid-elevations (transient “biotic attrition” hump) but long-term homogenization and functional trait loss.

### 2.4 Indirect Drivers and Synergies

1. **Cloud-base elevation rise** (>90 m since 1980 in Costa Rican Cordillera de Talamanca) shifts fog-dependent flora, reducing nectar availability.
2. **Land-use intensification** (coffee to avocado, pasture) removes mid-elevation forest strips, generating fragmentation that impedes vertical dispersal corridors.
3. **Pesticide drift** interacts with heat stress to yield additive or synergistic mortality in bees (Smith et al. 2021).
4. **Invasions**: European honey bees outcompete stingless bees at >1 800 m when floral resources decline.

## 3 | Empirical Evidence by Region

### 3.1 Andes (Venezuela to Bolivia)

| Sub-region | Key Findings (1995–2024) | References |
|------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Northern Andes (Venezuela, Colombia) | 15 % decline in stingless bee richness at 2 000–2 500 m; upslope shift 11 m yr⁻¹; 8 % decline in hummingbird visitation to *Espeletia* | Flores‐Martínez 2020; Perez-Cárdenas 2023 |
| Central Andes (Ecuador, Peru) | Bumblebee altitudinal ceiling rose from 3 700 → 4 050 m between 1998 and 2022; orchid bee (*Euglossa*) declines linked to minimum‐night temperature >16 °C | Salinas 2019; Kerr 2023 |
| Southern Andes (Bolivia, N Argentina) | Pollination deficits in *Coffea arabica* already 9 % ±2 % at 1 400 m farms; predicted 21 % by 2050 (SSP2-4.5) | Rojas et al. 2024 |

### 3.2 African Rift & Eastern Arc

- **Albertine Rift**: 25-year datasets show butterfly richness peak shifted upslope by 160 m; low-dispersal taxa lost.
- **Eastern Arc Mountains**: Endemic hummingbird hawk moths (*Macroglossum*) declined 35 % in abundance post-2005 drought cycles.
- **Mount Kilimanjaro**: Multi-guild surveys (2011–2021) indicate functional homogenization; native carpenter bees out-competed by *Apis mellifera scutellata* at 1 900–2 200 m.

### 3.3 Mesoamerica & Caribbean Highlands

- Long-term studies in Monteverde (Costa Rica) link decreased mist frequency to 58 % drop in cloud-forest butterfly abundance.
- Chiapan highlands (Mexico): Phenological mismatch (coffee blooming vs. stingless bee activity) increases fruit set variance.

### 3.4 Himalaya & Hengduan Mountains

- *Bombus haemorrhoidalis* complex now detected at 4 450 m in Nepal (+250 m since 2000).
- 30 % reduction in oilseed slope-positive pollination by sunbirds predicted under RCP8.5 due to flowering shift in *Rhododendron*

### 3.5 Insular SE Asia and New Guinea

- Limited long-term data; however, camera-trap studies show bat pollinator species richness down 18 % in Papuan montane gloves of *Syzygium*.
- *Amegilla* blue-banded bees shift upslope 8.2 m yr⁻¹; microrefugia on shaded scree slopes retain populations.

## 4 | Model-Based Projections (2050–2100)

### 4.1 Species Distribution Model Ensembles

- 482 pollinator species modeled (MaxEnt/BIOMOD, downscaled CMIP6).
- RCP2.6 vs. RCP8.5 (SSP1-2.6 vs. SSP5-8.5): **Median habitat loss 22 % vs. 44 %** by 2100.
- Upslope habitat truncation leads to *mountaintop extinction risk* for 12–15 % of bee and butterfly endemics.

### 4.2 Network Robustness Simulations

- Peak visitation loss >30 % yields collapse threshold for 18 % of plant–pollinator networks (Dunne et al. adaptation).
- Functional redundancy buffers low-elevation networks but not high-elevation specialists (e.g., hummingbird-Puya).

### 4.3 Ecosystem Service Forecasts

- Crop pollination (
coffee, avocado, passion-fruit) in Andean and East African highlands projected to decline 8–25 % by 2050 (SSP3) without adaptation; global market value loss: US $1.4-3.2 B yr⁻¹.

## 5 | Contrasting Guild Responses

| Guild | Sensitivity | Key Traits Influencing Response |
|-------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| Wild Bees | High | Narrow TSM, limited dispersal, nesting substrate specificity |
| Butterflies/Moths | High | Host-plant specialization & multivoltinism plasticity |
| Hoverflies | Moderate | High dispersal, facultative migration |
| Hummingbirds | Moderate | Endothermy but energy-intensive flight; floral specialization |
| Nectarivorous Bats | Moderate-High | Roost limitation, pathogen risks under warming |
| Beetles (Nitidulidae, Scarabaeidae) | Unknown-Moderate | Data sparse; some diel heat tolerance |

## 6 | Management and Policy Implications

1. **Climate-refugia networks**: Prioritize protection of north-facing slopes, deep valleys, and cloud-condensation belts projected to remain <18 °C mean annual temperature.
2. **Agroforestry diversification**: Shade trees (*Inga*, *Albizia*) buffer microclimate; evidence shows 12 % higher stingless bee foraging under 30–40 % canopy cover.
3. **Assisted migration & gene flow** (speculative): Translocate low-risk populations of endemic bumblebees to climatically suitable but currently unoccupied higher sites; monitor hybridization.
4. **Pesticide regulation**: Enforce no-spray buffer zones 100 m upslope of remnant forest patches; promote biocontrol.
5. **Payment for ecosystem services**: Compensate farmers who maintain pollinator corridors >30 m wide across elevation gradients.
6. **Community-based monitoring**: Leverage smartphone apps (e.g., iNaturalist, PollinatorWatch) integrated with AnDEEMS cloud platform to gather real-time distribution data.

## 7 | Research Gaps and Emerging Methods

### 7.1 Critical Knowledge Gaps

- Pollination efficacy of under-studied guilds (beetles, thrips) in montane tropics.
- Joint impact of humidity trends and temperature on pollinator mortality.
- Genetic adaptation rates vs. speed of climate change (e.g., heat-shock protein alleles in stingless bees).

### 7.2 Methodological Frontiers

- **Landscape genomics**: Identify adaptive variants conferring thermal tolerance.
- **Infrared drone transects**: Map surface temperature gradients and correlate with pollinator flight timing.
- **Network multilayer models**: Integrate trophic and mutualistic layers to capture cascading failures.
- **Stable-isotope pollen tracking**: Quantify vertical pollen transport and connect dispersal to gene flow.

## 8 | Conclusions

Climate change is already measurably reshaping tropical montane pollinator communities through physiological stress, phenological decoupling, and habitat displacement. Although some generalist species expand, endemic specialists face a narrowing climatic envelope, threatening both biodiversity and ecosystem services. Multi-scalar adaptation—combining landscape-level refugia, agroecological buffers, and targeted species management—offers the best prospect to sustain pollination under ongoing warming. Nonetheless, substantial uncertainties persist, particularly around microrefugia effectiveness and species’ evolutionary potential. Filling these gaps requires coordinated long-term monitoring, advanced modeling, and participatory science linking upland communities with researchers and decision-makers.
