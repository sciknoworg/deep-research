# Impacts of Buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica, Frangula alnus) Invasion on Biodiversity – A Synthesis

---

## 1  Executive Summary
Buckthorn (common buckthorn *Rhamnus cathartica* and glossy buckthorn *Frangula alnus*) is now one of the most pervasively disruptive woody invaders of temperate North America and parts of Europe. A synthesis of 24+ primary studies and meta-analyses reveals that buckthorn alters all major biodiversity dimensions: it depresses native plant richness and structural heterogeneity, triggers multi-trophic arthropod declines (–55 % abundance, –21 % taxon richness for woody invaders), promotes small-mammal dominance, accelerates N-cycling, modifies soil physicochemistry and microtopography, and drives community‐level regime shifts that persist without sustained management. Local abiotic disturbance—particularly canopy openness and exposed mineral soil—more strongly predicts buckthorn success than does native species richness, while “enemy release” (5–9× lower herbivory than natives) further amplifies competitive effects.

Key quantified impacts
• Up to 50 % reduction in understory herb species richness; ≥55 % loss of arthropod abundance.
• Blooming thickets reduce bee and detritivore abundance by >50 %, yet elevate *Peromyscus* spp. densities.
• Leaf-litter extract pulses double extractable N in the first fortnight and shift microbial C:N ratios.
• Dense *F. alnus* in prairie fens lowers soil pH, raises organic matter and erodes floristic quality.
• Accelerated nutrient cycling and shade combine with low herbivory to create positive feedbacks that reinforce invasion.

Management implications
Repeated, sustained control is essential; one-off clearing may simply reset stands to low-diversity mammal-dominated states. Fungus-based stump treatments (*Chondrostereum purpureum*) match glyphosate efficacy (p < 0.001) but require adequate canopy closure. Non-chemical “Buckthorn Baggies” kill ≈81 % of stems (size-limited). Integrated strategies that couple mechanical removal with rapid canopy re-closure, native plantings and potential biological controls hold the greatest promise.

## 2  Background

### 2.1 Focal Taxa
• *Rhamnus cathartica* L. (common/European buckthorn) – shade-tolerant deciduous shrub/tree to 6 m, bird-dispersed.
• *Frangula alnus* Mill. (= *Rhamnus frangula* L.; glossy buckthorn) – similar stature, broader wetland tolerance.

### 2.2 Geographic Scope
Most quantitative data derive from temperate forest, wetland and prairie fen ecosystems in the U.S. Midwest (Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin), northeastern states (New Hampshire, New York) and southern Ontario; comparable patterns occur in European riparian and forest edges.

### 2.3 Biodiversity Dimensions Considered
1 Plant taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, structural heterogeneity.
2 Invertebrate and pollinator communities.
3 Vertebrates (small mammals, birds).
4 Soil microbial biomass, community composition and function.
5 Ecosystem processes (light regime, nutrient cycling, microtopography).

## 3  Drivers of Buckthorn Dominance

### 3.1 Disturbance & Abiotic Filters
A 24-site survey of Minnesota oak forests (Learning #1) found canopy openness and percent bare soil were the strongest positive predictors of *R. cathartica* cover. Neither native plant richness nor total understory cover suppressed invasion; only higher resident phylogenetic diversity exerted a measurable brake.

### 3.2 Enemy Release
In northeastern Illinois woodlands (Learning #8) buckthorn foliage suffered only 0.8 % herbivory versus 4.0–6.8 % on co-occurring native trees—consistent with enemy-release theory, advantaging growth and reproduction.

### 3.3 Positive Soil & Light Feedbacks
*F. alnus* leaf extracts doubled extractable inorganic N within 1–2 weeks (Learning #4), stimulating microbial mineralization and likely fertilising subsequent cohorts of buckthorn seedlings. Prairie fen studies (Learning #5) show buckthorn lowers pH and raises organic matter, dampening graminoid cover and creating shaded, nutrient-enriched microsites.

## 4  Biodiversity Impacts Across Levels of Organization

### 4.1 Vascular Plant Communities
– Four New Hampshire Pinus–hardwood sites: Glossy buckthorn basal area alone explained the majority of variance in woody seedling density (p < 0.001) and herb-layer richness (p < 0.01), outperforming light, soil pH and texture (Learnings #6, #12).
– Buffalo, NY 106-ha preserve: herbaceous diversity in closed canopy stands declined linearly with *Rhamnus* seedling counts.
– Closed buckthorn thickets post-one-off clearing lost >50 % of plant richness relative to continuously managed Native plots (Learnings #7, #9).

Mechanisms: Dense shade (earlier leaf-out, late leaf-drop), allelopathic litter, and altered microtopography (hummock loss) jointly constrain recruitment of light-demanding and specialist taxa. The reduction in the Floristic Coefficient of Conservatism in prairie fens underscores selective loss of conservative, habitat-specialist species.

### 4.2 Invertebrate & Pollinator Communities
A 56-study meta-analysis (Learning #2) documented a 29 % mean drop in arthropod abundance under plant invasions, swelling to 55 % for woody invaders like buckthorn. Taxon richness fell 17 % overall, 21 % for woody invaders. Field experiments (Learnings #7, #9) recorded >50 % declines in bee and leaf-litter beetle abundance in unmanaged buckthorn patches.

Trophic effects: Loss of floral resources and structural simplification diminish pollinator nesting/foraging habitat; litter chemistry may deter detritivore decomposer guilds, suppressing detrital food webs.

### 4.3 Vertebrates – Small Mammal Release & Avifauna Consequences
In the Buffalo removal experiment (Learning #7) *Peromyscus* spp. densities were highest in Closed Buckthorn regrowth stands, suggesting dense shrub cover provides refuge from predators. Elevated mouse populations can, in turn, predate ground-nesting birds or consume seeds, further hindering native plant recovery. Bird assemblage data are sparse, but analogous shrub invasions elsewhere reduce ground-nest and shrub-nest specialist birds.

### 4.4 Soil Microbial Communities & Nutrient Dynamics
– Wetland paired plots (Learning #10) showed significantly higher net N-mineralization in buckthorn stands across seasons with no change in total extractable N or TRFLP fungal–bacterial community structure—implying functional shifts without wholesale taxonomic turnover.
– Microbial biomass C:N ratio declines after *F. alnus* litter inputs (Learning #4), consistent with faster N cycling and potential C limitation of microbes.

Net effect: Buckthorn behaves as a nutrient pump, accelerating N availability that disproportionately benefits fast-growing, high‐N leaf phenotypes (including itself) while disadvantaging slower-growing, conservative natives.

### 4.5 Ecosystem-Level Functions
1 Light regime: Buckthorn leafs out earlier and holds leaves longer, compressing the seasonal light window for spring ephemerals.
2 Hydrology & Microtopography: Prairie fen buckthorn stands reduce vegetative hummocks m⁻², homogenizing microrelief critical for specialist sedge and fen flora.
3 Trophic Simplification: Cascading from understory plant loss → arthropod decline → simplified vertebrate webs.

## 5  Context Dependence & Threshold Responses

• Invader impacts scale with abundance: linear declines in richness and seedling density vs. basal area (Learnings #6 & #12). Management must therefore target early suppression before thickets reach threshold densities (>30–40 % cover) beyond which recovery of seed banks and biota is slow.

• Disturbance interacts with invasion: Canopy gaps created by storm, logging or disease amplify buckthorn colonization; conversely, rapid overstory closure after removal significantly boosts native recruitment (Learning #3, canopy interaction p = 0.013).

## 6  Management Implications & Intervention Toolbox

### 6.1 Mechanical & Physical Controls
• Cut-stump followed by “Buckthorn Baggies” (black polypropylene sleeves) killed 80.7 % of stems (Learning #11). Effectiveness declines with diameter; best for <10 cm DBH. Slightly costlier than herbicide, but attractive for chemical-free zones (riparian buffers, organic farms).
• Whole-tree pulling/uprooting feasible for saplings; minimize soil disturbance to avoid seed bank activation.

### 6.2 Chemical Controls
Glyphosate or triclopyr cut-stump/ basal bark remain standard; however, emerging herbicide bans and public opposition necessitate alternatives.

### 6.3 Biological Controls & Novel Tools
• Native saprophytic fungus *Chondrostereum purpureum*: Michigan trial (Learning #3) matched glyphosate in preventing stump sprouting within one season (p < 0.001). Efficacy linked to canopy closure; spores require humidity/ shade—integrate with prompt overstory recovery plantings.
• Speculative: exploration of buckthorn seed predators or specialist rust fungi from Eurasia; strict host specificity testing required.

### 6.4 Silvicultural/ Ecological Interventions
1 Overstory Management: Encourage rapid canopy closure post-removal to shade seedlings; use fast-growing native shade-casting species (e.g., *Acer rubrum*, *Betula alleghaniensis*).
2 Competitive Native Plantings: Seed mid-shade‐tolerant graminoids and forbs to occupy gap microsites, leveraging phylogenetic diversity’s suppressive effect (Learning #1).
3 Soil Amendments: Where excessive N persists, carbon additions (sawdust, high-C mulch) could immobilise N, tipping competitive balance towards conservative natives (speculative; needs trials).
4 Herbivore Pressure: Reintroduce/ encourage deer browsing management; although deer avoid buckthorn foliage, limiting other palatable plants exacerbates invasion. Adaptive deer density targets necessary.

### 6.5 Monitoring & Adaptive Management
• Biodiversity indicators: understory richness, herb–shrub cover ratio, pitfall‐trap beetle counts, soil N-mineralization rates.
• Treatment recurrency: stump resprout surveys at 1, 3 and 5 years; seedbank assays to gauge depletion.
• Remote sensing: LiDAR canopy openness + hyperspectral buckthorn signature mapping for landscape-scale prioritization.

## 7  Knowledge Gaps & Research Opportunities

1 Bird Community Responses – Only indirect evidence via small-mammal release; systematic point counts needed.
2 Allelopathic Compounds – Chemical identity and persistence of Rhamnus secondary metabolites on germination of natives.
3 Long-term Soil Function – Does decades-long buckthorn presence cause irreversible soil acidification/OM accumulation? Chronosequence studies required.
4 Climate Change Interaction – Warming may extend buckthorn phenological advantage; model predictions under varying disturbance regimes.
5 Biocontrol Risk Assessment – Host-specific Eurasian natural enemies (seed weevils, *Puccinia* rusts) under evaluation; stringent non-target trials essential.

## 8  Conclusions
Buckthorn invasion exerts a multi-faceted assault on biodiversity, collapsing understory plant richness, truncating arthropod food webs, re-wiring nutrient cycling and shifting vertebrate community balance. Its dominance is underpinned by disturbance-facilitated establishment, enemy release and soil-mediated positive feedbacks. Effective mitigation therefore requires an integrated approach marrying sustained physical/biological control with ecological restoration that reinstates shade and competitive native assemblages. One-off interventions are demonstrably insufficient—continuous pressure is imperative to prevent rebound and to restore the full complement of ecosystem functions.

While knowledge gaps persist, particularly regarding higher trophic responses and long-term soil legacies, the current evidence base justifies aggressive, landscape-scale management to curb buckthorn spread and to safeguard temperate‐zone biodiversity.
