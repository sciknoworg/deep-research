# Mechanistic Foundations of Biological Invasions: A Cross-Taxonomic, Stage-Explicit Synthesis

*Prepared for an expert readership. All citations refer to the numbered reference list at the end; italics denote speculative or emerging concepts.*

## 1. Framing the Question: Why “Mechanisms” Matter
Invasion ecology now enjoys four decades of conceptual refinement, yet predictive power remains limited because explanatory variables are often conflated (e.g. propagule pressure vs. colonization pressure) or omitted (Colautti et al. 2006 [6,9]). Here I dissect **ecological, evolutionary, and eco-evolutionary mechanisms** across the canonical invasion stages—**transport, introduction, establishment, spread, impact**—while highlighting cross-taxonomic generalities. All 13 “learnings” supplied by the user are incorporated verbatim or by direct inference.

## 2. Transport & Introduction: Crossing the First Filters

### 2.1 Propagule Pressure (PP) vs. Colonization Pressure (CP)

1. **Definitions** (Lockwood, Cassey & Blackburn 2009 [1,3])  
   • PP = (number of individuals) × (number of introduction events) for **one species**.  
   • CP = number of **species** released at a site.  

2. **Non-linear PP ↔ CP relationship**. Simulations show that increasing PP yields diminishing returns once CP saturates [1,3]; managers should therefore treat CP as the *null* driver of site-level exotic richness.

3. **Risk-assessment implication**: 71 % of published invasion studies still *omit* PP (Colautti et al. 2006 [6,9]). Any trait-based generalisation (e.g. “fast growth predicts invasion”) is confounded until PP/CP are controlled.

### 2.2 Quality, Not Just Quantity

Factorial experiments with *Bemisia* whiteflies demonstrate that **genetic quality** (outbred vs. inbred founders) often trumps sheer headcount [5,11]. On novel hosts (a proxy for recipient-environment harshness) the benefit of outbreeding magnifies, elevating *R*0 even when founder numbers are low.

• *Actionable angle*: quarantine protocols should screen for both *numbers* and *genetic provenance*—e.g., single shipments that pool multiple source populations are higher risk than equal-sized, genetically homogeneous shipments.

### 2.3 Transport-Stage Selection & Context Dependence

Recent microcosm work (Jones et al. 2017; Kumschick & Ricciardi 2024 [8]) shows that **resident community composition** modulates propagule effectiveness:  
• Dominant residents → success scales with *propagule number*.  
• Depauperate/slow-growing residents → *arrival timing* is decisive (priority effects).  

Hence, identical PP delivers variable outcomes across sites—a classic source of “noise” in correlative datasets.

## 3. Establishment: Demography Meets Genetics

### 3.1 Polyploid Advantage & Cytotype Dynamics

The *Centaurea stoebe* complex illustrates how genome duplication bypasses early filters: **polycarpic tetraploids dominate North America, whereas monocarpic diploids dominate Eurasia** [2]. Tetraploidy confers:  
• Increased fecundity per episode.  
• Broad environmental tolerance.  
• Potential for asexual seed set.

Parallel patterns emerge in *Butomus*, *Knautia*, and *Tripleurospermum* where **minority‐cytotype disadvantage** is conditional—not absolute [12]. Only 2/6 monitored plots showed minority cytotype decline; disturbance and soil nutrients modulated trajectories.

A deterministic genomotype model [10] predicts narrow coexistence windows among diploid–triploid–tetraploid mosaics; *odd cytotypes* (triploids) function as **gene-flow bridges** [4]. This erodes reproductive isolation and may **accelerate adaptive introgression** into novel ranges.

### 3.2 Propagule Demography × Genetics Revisited

Bemisia trials [5,11] reaffirm that **demographic rescue** and **genetic rescue** are intertwined. For high-risk species, regulators could require “isolation breeding” before release—*opposite* of horticultural practices that mix provenances to enhance vigor.

---

## 4. Spread: Landscape-Level Dynamics
While the provided learnings focus on early stages, several inferences can be drawn:

1. **Non-linear scaling from local establishment to regional spread**: The Lockwood CP framework implies that as the number of **established species** (CP realized) rises, each additional species disproportionately lifts the propagule rain entering neighboring habitats.

2. **Cytotype mosaics create heterogeneous fitness landscapes**; ploidy-specific dispersal kernels can generate patchy but rapidly coalescing invasion fronts (speculative).

3. **Eco‐evolutionary feedbacks**: Rapid adaptation in founder zones feeds back into propagule quality (higher fitness seeds/larvae), potentially overriding Allee effects during range expansion.

---

## 5. Impact: From Population to Ecosystem Consequences

Although none of the 13 learnings quantify impact per se, two mechanistic threads connect earlier stages to impact severity:

1. **Genetic novelty** via hybridisation or polyploidy often correlates with broader niche breadth, inflating per capita effects (e.g., allelopathy in tetraploid *C. stoebe*).

2. **Community pre-adaptation**: Resident assemblages experiencing high CP may evolve generalized resistance; thus impact magnitude is *contextual*, challenging single-value risk indices.

## 6. Cross-Taxonomic Mechanistic Matrix

| Mechanism                         | Plants | Animals | Microbes |
|-----------------------------------|--------|---------|----------|
| Propagule pressure (PP)           | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |
| Colonization pressure (CP)        | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |
| Polyploidy / Cytotype             | ✓      | (rare)  | (N/A)    |
| Hybridisation                     | ✓      | ✓       | ✓ (HGT)  |
| Genetic quality (inbreeding)      | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |
| Transport-stage selection         | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |
| Priority effects / arrival timing | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |

*Note*: For microbes, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) often fulfills the role of hybridisation.

## 7. Management & Research Implications

1. **Shift Risk Screening from Trait-Centric to Mechanism-Centric**. Mandatory reporting of PP and CP would immediately improve global datasets.
2. **Genetic Provenance Audits**. Sequencing of intercepted consignments could flag high-diversity pools before release.
3. **Cytotype-Targeted Biocontrol**. Biocontrol agents specialized on dominant cytotypes (e.g., tetraploids) may prevent replacement cycles that favour even more vigorous genomes.
4. **Dynamic Quarantine Thresholds**. Recognize that “safe” propagule sizes are context dependent; fewer individuals may suffice in low-competition recipient communities.
5. **Predictive Genomotype Modelling**. Apply the 4-endpoint model [10] to forecast which cytotype mixtures pose runaway risk.
6. **Experimental Manipulation of CP**. Field trials that vary *number of species* released (under containment) could verify CP as a null model and refine biotic resistance theory.
7. **Leverage Synthetic Biology for ‘Gene Drives’** (speculative). Gene drives targeting invasive cytotypes could collapse populations, but biosafety frameworks lag behind.

## 8. Knowledge Gaps & Contrarian Angles

• *Low PP Successes*: Case studies exist where single gravid females establish (e.g., parthenogenetic weevils). Indicates that **per capita fitness** can dominate PP under certain life histories.

• *Epigenetic Pre-adaptation*: Stress priming in horticultural stock (“hardening off”) may pre-equip propagules for invasion—virtually unstudied.

• *Biotic Resistance Can Facilitate*: Diversity can *absorb* propagules without population growth, yet later disturbance unlocks latent invaders—contradicting the classic resistance paradigm.

---

## 9. Conclusion
A synthesis of current evidence underscores that **propagule dynamics (quantity and quality), cytogenetic processes, and recipient community context** are the indispensable triad of invasion mechanisms. Ignoring any leg bleeds predictive power. Future surveillance and modelling must capture *pressure*, *provenance*, and *ploidy* as standard covariates.
