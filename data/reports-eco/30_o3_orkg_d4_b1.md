## 1. Introduction and Problem Framing
Soil is not merely the physical anchor of terrestrial plants; it is an intricate habitat hosting billions of microbes, micro-fauna and macro-fauna that together constitute a powerful, if largely invisible, driver of above-ground ecological dynamics. Insects, which account for the majority of terrestrial biodiversity and a substantial fraction of crop losses, are often thought of as above-ground organisms, yet an expanding body of research demonstrates that their abundance, behavior and community organization are strongly modulated by the biotic composition of the soil. These linkages materialize through both direct contacts (e.g., entomopathogenic interactions) and indirect bridges built via changes in plant physiology, volatile signaling, nutrient regimes and natural-enemy assemblages.

This synthesis collates state-of-the-art mechanistic insights, cross-ecosystem comparisons and applied implications, explicitly incorporating 12 recent learning nuggets (2018–2024) provided as background material. The goal is to deliver a technically rigorous, yet integrative, perspective usable by agroecologists, chemical ecologists and pest-management strategists seeking a holistic understanding of soil-driven insect outcomes.

## 2. Conceptual Pathways Linking Soil Biota to Insect Ecology
1. **Direct Pathways**  
   • Soil-dwelling entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria (e.g., *Bacillus thuringiensis*) and nematodes attack insect eggs, larvae or pupae within the soil compartment.  
   • Endophytic colonizers (e.g., *Gilmaniella* spp.) can become systemic, entering insect tissues directly.  
   • Predatory soil arthropods (mites, carabids) affect herbivore populations via direct predation.

2. **Plant-Mediated Indirect Pathways (bottom-up trophic cascades)**  
   • Nutrient provisioning (P, N, Fe, micronutrients) alters plant tissue quality and secondary metabolite pools, thereby influencing herbivore growth and reproduction.  
   • Phytohormone cross-talk (JA, SA, ET, GA, NO, H₂O₂) drives constitutive and inducible defence, affecting host acceptance and performance.  
   • Root-to-shoot chemical signaling rewires the bouquet of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), altering the sensory ecology of both herbivores and their parasitoids/predators.

3. **Enemy-Mediated Indirect Pathways (top-down cascades)**  
   • Soil biota can prime (or suppress) HIPVs that recruit parasitoids and predators, thereby modifying third-trophic-level efficacy.

4. **Eco-evolutionary Feedback Loops**  
   • Insect herbivory shapes rhizosphere microbial community structure, which in turn feeds back on subsequent plant generations—a dynamic plant–soil feedback (PSF) mechanism with long-term implications for insect assemblages.

## 3. Functional Groups of Soil Biota and Their Insect-Relevant Effects
### 3.1. Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF)
AMF form >400 M-year-old mutualisms with ~80 % of land plants, exchanging soil nutrients for photosynthate. Their insect consequences are multifaceted:

1. **Nutrient & Growth Effects**  
   • Enhanced P and N uptake often increases plant biomass, diluting constitutive defences (growth–differentiation balance) but also freeing carbon for inducible pathways.  
   • In soybean, AMF boosted yield **and** N₂O emissions (+39 % field, +63 % pot) by elevating extractable N and denitrifier genes (*nirS/nirK*) (Learning 3). While absolute greenhouse gas flux rose, yield-scaled emissions fell—underscoring nuanced sustainability trade-offs.

2. **Hormone Crosstalk**  
   • High external phosphate suppresses AM symbiosis via gibberellic acid (GA) build-up; tobacco lines with GA catabolism genes (*GAMT*, *GA2-ox*) escape this repression, displaying faster colonization and reduced P sensitivity (Learning 4).  
   • Ethylene (ET) antagonizes phosphate inhibition: constitutive ET mutants or ethephon-treated tomato maintain high AM colonization even at 2–5 mM Pi, whereas ET-insensitive lines suffer sharp suppression (Learning 11).  
   • AM fungal spores themselves exude a hormone cocktail—cytokinin, auxin, GA₄, ethylene precursor—meaning AMF are **sources** rather than mere sinks of phytohormones (Learning 9).  
   • Canopy light quality (high Red:Far-Red) up-regulates JA and strigolactone exudation, accelerating *Rhizophagus* hyphal growth (Learning 2). This ties above-ground spectral cues to below-ground symbiosis and, by extension, to insect defence.

3. **Volatile and Metabolite Rewiring**  
   • *Funneliformis mosseae* colonization in grapevine elevated leaf VOCs by 85 % and specifically increased defence‐linked volatiles such as (E)-2-hexenal, 3-hexenal, benzaldehyde and methyl salicylate, while depleting flavour‐important C₁₃-norisoprenoids (Learning 5).  
   • In *Vicia faba*, AM colonization attracted aphids independent of tissue P. AM plants emitted less naphthalene and, under P shortage, suppressed (S)-linalool, (E)-caryophyllene and (R)-germacrene D—demonstrating defence rerouting uncoupled from nutrition (Learning 6).  
   • AMF effects on third-trophic interactions are assemblage-specific: *Leucanthemum vulgare* showed lower leaf-miner parasitism in natural AMF field conditions, yet targeted inoculations with different AMF species caused parasitism to increase, decrease or remain unchanged (Learning 12).

4. **Guild-Specific Insect Outcomes (meta-analysis)**  
   • Per a 2018 *Frontiers in Plant Science* synthesis (Learning 10): AMF generally boost sap-suckers, have neutral effects on chewers (with + specialists/– generalists), and negatively affect natural enemies—underscoring the need for guild-tailored management.

### 3.2. Endophytic and Rhizosphere Fungi Beyond AMF
• In *Atractylodes lancea*, the endophyte *Gilmaniella* sp. AL12 triggers sesquiterpene-rich volatile oil via a **NO → H₂O₂ → JA** cascade; salicylic acid (SA) is antagonistic (Learning 1). Physiological blockers (cPTIO, DPI, CAT, ibuprofen) delineate the pathway. Such biochemical precision reveals how endophytes can reprogramme herbivore deterrents and medicinal traits simultaneously.

• Non-AMF rhizosphere shifts can be insect-driven: in *Jacobaea vulgaris*, below-ground herbivory decreased *Fusarium oxysporum* and increased *Phoma exigua* abundances, yielding the least-negative plant–soil feedback on subsequent cohorts (Learning 8).

### 3.3. Plant-Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR)
Meta-analysis shows PGPR **consistently suppress** above-ground herbivore performance/abundance across field trials (Learning 10). Mechanisms include ISR (Induced Systemic Resistance) via priming of JA/ET pathways, niche pre-emption at the root surface and resource competition with pathogens.

### 3.4. Nematodes, Root Herbivores and Soil Arthropods
• Root-feeding nematodes can **mirror** some AMF effects: they reduce sap-sucker performance via altered phloem quality, yet rarely influence chewing herbivores (Learning 7).  
• Soil arthropod impacts remain idiosyncratic, reflecting species-specific diets and microhabitats.


## 4. Plant Hormonal and Metabolic Gateways: Mechanistic Integration
Key signalling intersections shaping insect outcomes:

1. **NO / H₂O₂ / JA Node**  
   – Endophyte-mediated volatiles require NO-derived ROS before JA up-regulation (Learning 1).  
   – Herbivore attack often triggers ROS bursts; endophytes may thus pre-prime this pathway.

2. **JA–SA Antagonism**  
   – Endophyte case above shows reciprocal antagonism. Many insects exploit SA bias (typical of biotroph defence) to reduce JA-dependent anti-chewer toxins.

3. **GA and Phosphate Crosstalk**  
   – GA accumulation under high Pi suppresses AMF; manipulating GA turnover genes uncouples nutrient management from symbiosis (Learning 4).

4. **Ethylene as a Phosphate Gatekeeper**  
   – High ET rescues AMF under high Pi (Learning 11). ET also interacts with JA in ISR, influencing herbivore resistance.

5. **Light Quality, JA and Strigolactones**  
   – High R:FR (indicative of low competition) feeds forward to root JA + strigolactone export, favouring AMF and indirectly altering defence allocation (Learning 2).

6. **Fungal Hormone Secretion**  
   – AMF spores release CK, IAA, GA₄, ET precursors (Learning 9), possibly manipulating host development and defence to their advantage—analogous to bacterial effectors.

## 5. Above-Ground Consequences: Herbivore Performance, Attraction and Natural Enemies
1. **Performance Metrics**  
   • Sap-sucking aphids often increase on AM plants (nutrient uplift + altered amino-acid balance).  
   • Chewers may face unchanged or heightened resistance, contingent on JA up-regulation.

2. **Attraction/Repellence**  
   • Volatile bouquets determine host-finding. Reduced naphthalene and linalool in AM *V. faba* correlated with higher aphid attraction (Learning 6).

3. **Natural-Enemy Recruitment**  
   • HIPV shifts can either attract or deter parasitoids. Species-specific AMF inoculations changed parasitism rates in *Leucanthemum*—an under-exploited lever for biological control (Learning 12).

4. **Ecosystem Feedbacks**  
   • Herbivory history alters rhizosphere fungi, looping back to plant fitness and subsequent herbivore damage (Learning 8). Such PSFs can persist across seasons.

## 6. Case Studies Derived from Recent Primary Literature
• **Soybean–AMF–N₂O Trade-off**: AMF boost yield yet raise absolute N₂O. Solutions may include nitrification inhibitors co-applied with AM inoculant or breeding for *nosZ*-positive microbiomes to close the denitrification loop.  
• **Grapevine VOC Rerouting**: Winemakers seeking specific aroma profiles may need AMF portfolio management; simultaneously, elevated benzaldehyde and MeSA could enhance resistance against *Lobesia botrana*.  
• **Tobacco GA Catabolism Lines**: Deploying *GAMT/Ga2-ox* transgenics enables consistent AMF benefits in high-fertilizer regimes—relevant for intensive glasshouse tobacco or tomato where Pi levels are high.  
• **High R:FR Lighting in Greenhouses**: LED rigs tuned to raise R:FR could double as AMF-priming tools, indirectly fortifying crops against thrips or whiteflies via JA metabolic shifts.

## 7. Cross-Ecosystem Patterns and Context Dependence
• **Natural Grasslands**: Diversity of AMF and PGPR drives high variance in insect communities; PSF loops are strong due to perennial root systems.  
• **Row-Crop Agriculture**: Fertilizer and tillage suppress AMF diversity; insect outcomes skew toward nutrient-mediated bottom-up effects rather than defence priming.  
• **Greenhouses**: Light spectra, substrate sterilization and CO₂ enrichment make hormonal crosstalk (R:FR→JA, ET) highly malleable, allowing precise manipulation of soil-biota–insect dynamics.

## 8. Applications: Ecologically Informed Pest Management and Climate-Smart Agriculture
1. **Mycorrhizal Inoculant Design**  
   – Match AMF species/strains to target pest guilds and desired volatile profiles; avoid one-size-fits-all products.  
   – Stack with GA catabolism or ET-releasing treatments to overcome fertilizer suppression.

2. **PGPR Consortia**  
   – Combine PGPR that prime JA-ET pathways with AMF that do not overly favour sap-suckers; synthetic communities can be screened via high-throughput volatome assays.

3. **Light-Quality Manipulation**  
   – Use dynamic R:FR lighting schedules to boost root JA exudation and AMF engagement at critical seedling stages.  

4. **Breeding and Gene Editing**  
   – CRISPR/Cas edits in GA or ET receptors to fine-tune AM symbiosis under variable Pi.  
   – Introduce promoters responsive to fungal hormone signatures (CK, GA₄) that trigger targeted defence cascades.

5. **Decision Support Tools**  
   – Integrate soil biota metrics (AMF colonization %, PGPR diversity indices, nematode guild composition) into IPM dashboards.  

6. **Climate Mitigation Co-Benefits**  
   – Deploy AMF + *nosZ*-rich denitrifier communities to cap N₂O; concurrently, use HIPV-based natural enemy recruitment to reduce insecticide reliance.

## 9. Frontier Hypotheses, Contrarian Ideas and Speculative Avenues
1. **AMF as Quasi-Plants**: Given their hormone secretion abilities (CK, IAA, GA₄, ET), AMF might be considered de facto phytohormone micro-factories, steering host phenotypes beyond mutualistic nutrient exchange (Learning 9).  *(Speculative)*

2. **Volatile Cross-Talk as a Coding Language**: Endophyte-driven redox→JA cascades could encode specific VOC signatures that insects decode; manipulating ROS kinetics may enable on-demand ‘volatile writing’.  *(Speculative)*

3. **Microbiome Editing via Insect Herbivory**: Deliberate early-season root herbivory (low-damage agents) might engineer rhizosphere fungi toward beneficial PSFs, reducing later foliar pest pressure (inspired by Learning 8).  *(Contrarian)

## 10. Knowledge Gaps and Experimental Priorities
1. **Multi-kingdom Interactions**: Most studies isolate AMF or PGPR; factorial designs including fungi, bacteria and nematodes are rare.  
2. **Metabolite Flux Quantification**: Need direct measurement of carbon/nitrogen allocation under simultaneous nutrient and defence demands.  
3. **Long-Term PSF Effects in Annual Crops**: Persistence of insect-mediated rhizosphere shifts across rotations is poorly characterized.  
4. **Volatome–Enemy Coupling**: Dissecting which HIPVs are causal vs correlative in parasitoid recruitment under variable AMF assemblages.  
5. **Climate Extremes**: Heat/drought interactions with soil biota–insect linkages remain under-explored.

## 11. Concluding Remarks
Soil biota influence insects via a tapestry of direct attacks, nutrient provisioning, hormonal hijacking and volatile orchestration. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi emerge as central hubs, yet endophytes, PGPR and nematodes provide equally nuanced, and sometimes opposing, pressures. Understanding—and harnessing—these subterranean drivers can redefine sustainable pest management, reduce chemical inputs and buffer agro-ecosystems against climate variability. Integration of genetic, biochemical and eco-physiological approaches, combined with high-resolution volatome and metagenome analytics, will be pivotal to turning this mechanistic knowledge into field-ready innovations.
