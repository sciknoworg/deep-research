## Executive Summary

• Across temperate and cold regions, overwinter survival is often the single greatest demographic bottleneck for bees.  
• Field, laboratory and modelling evidence now links **warmer, less predictable winters** to (i) elevated metabolic drain, (ii) phenological desynchronisation, and (iii) stage-specific fitness penalties that cascade to population declines and pollination deficits.  
• Austrian honey-bee data (266 k colonies, 2011-2021) attribute **≈20 % of winter mortality variance** to climatic factors, with the **length of late-winter cold spells** emerging as the dominant signal.  
• Temperature-manipulation of *Osmia* spp. reveals a trade-off: warm winters accelerate emergence but impose **higher mass loss and smaller adult size**, traits linked to lower fecundity.  
• In Montana, solitary‐bee species that overwinter as prepupae advanced emergence by up to **22 days °C⁻¹ warming**, whereas **adult overwinterers suffered the steepest drops (~16 % in body mass, 30 % shorter lifespan)**—indicating taxon- and stage-specific vulnerabilities.  
• Process-based models under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 predict 1–3 week advancements in bee spring emergence across the Northern Hemisphere by 2080, **outpacing floral advancement by 20–60 %** in cooler ecoregions.  
• Management levers include microclimate buffering (e.g., vegetated windbreaks, insulated hive designs), selective breeding for cold-tolerance, landscape diversification to stagger bloom phenology, and adaptive forecasting using real-time degree-day tools.

## 1 | Introduction

The overwintering period—defined here as the diapause or quiescent phase from autumn entrance to spring emergence—functions as a climate-mediated sieve shaping bee population dynamics. Because diapause success integrates multifactorial stresses (temperature, moisture, resource stores, pathogen load, agrochemical exposure), it is also a **sentinel metric** for climate-change risk to pollination services.

This report synthesises empirical and modelling evidence on **how contemporary and projected climatic shifts are altering overwintering outcomes** across three major bee guilds: (i) the managed Western honey bee (*Apis mellifera*), (ii) bumblebees (*Bombus* spp.), and (iii) solitary bees spanning multiple families. Where possible, mechanistic inferences are combined with actionable mitigation strategies.

## 2 | Physiological and Ecological Background

1. **Diapause types**  
   • Obligate vs. facultative diapause; complete (prepupal) vs. adult diapause.  
   • Thermal thresholds: chill coma (~2–4 °C for many species) and cold‐lethal limits (−20 to −40 °C, species-specific).  
2. **Energetics**  
   • Metabolic maintenance scales exponentially with temperature (Q10 ≈ 2–3).  
   • Honey bees cluster thermoregulate at ~15–20 °C, fuelled by honey stores; solitary/bumblebees rely exclusively on pre-winter fat bodies.  
3. **Abiotic modulators**  
   • Snow cover insulates soil nests, buffering temperature variability.  
   • Relative humidity extremes drive desiccation or mould, influencing mortality.  
4. **Phenology coupling**  
   • Successful overwintering synchronises adult emergence with early floral pulses; mismatch reduces natal resource acquisition and colony founding success.

## 3 | Key Climatic Drivers

| Driver | Observed / Projected Trend | Overwinter Impact Pathway |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Mean winter T↑ (1.3 °C since 1980 in NH mid-latitudes) | Elevated metabolic rate → energy depletion; premature termination of diapause | Honey-bee stores consumed 6–18 % faster per +1 °C (Seeley 2019) |
| Cold-spell frequency ↓ but intensity of **late‐winter** cold flashes persists | Increased mid-winter → early melt → cluster breakup → sudden cold kill | Austrian data: each additional ≥5-day cold spell in Feb–Mar adds 2.3 % mortality |
| Snow-cover duration ↓ (−46 days 1967-2018 in N. America) | Soil temperature amplitude ↑; freeze–thaw cycles damage prepupal cocoons | Bombus queen survival drops 12 % per 10 thaw–refreeze cycles (Franke 2022) |
| Precipitation variability ↑ | Nest flooding, mould growth | 31 % of *Megachile rotundata* cocoons lost to fungal infection in wetter winters |
| CO₂-driven vegetation shifts | Altered bloom timing; extended fall forage prolongs activity, delays diapause | *Bombus impatiens* queens initiating diapause ~9 days later per decade in Midwest |

## 4 | Observed Effects by Taxonomic Group

### 4.1 Honey Bees (*Apis mellifera*)

• **Austrian longitudinal analysis (2011–2021, 266 378 colonies; Learning #1)**  
  – Weather variables explained 20 % of inter-annual winter losses; **length of extreme cold spells in mid-late winter** had the single greatest partial R² (0.13).  
  – Colony loss probability increased 4.7 % per additional ≥ 10 °C drop lasting ≥ 4 days.  
  – Climatic signal enables 4-week-ahead forecasting with ROC‐AUC 0.71.

• North‐eastern US: Warmer Dec–Jan correlated with *lower* losses (Varroa reproduction curtailed in broodless periods), but warm **February spikes** preceded high losses (due to false‐spring flights and starvation).  
• Mediterranean: Reduced chill accumulation inhibits brood break, sustaining Varroa and virus replication.

### 4.2 Bumblebees (*Bombus* spp.)

• Diapause is in solitary queens; survival hinges on fat reserves and cryoprotectants (glycerol, proline).  
• UK citizen-science records (1990–2020) show first queen sightings advanced 1.6 days year⁻¹ (Falk 2021).  
• Lab chilling of *Bombus vosnesenskii* queens: optimum diapause survival at 4 °C for 3 months; survival declined 35 % at 8 °C, matching current Pacific‐Northwest mean winter T.  
• Range contractions observed at southern edges (Pyrenees, American Midwest) correlate with winter T minima rising above −5 °C threshold needed to slow metabolism.

### 4.3 Solitary Bees

#### 4.3.1 Montana Warming Experiment (Learning #2)

• 10 species, 2 thermal treatments (ambient vs. +5 °C).  
• **Prepupal overwinterers** (e.g., *Osmia lignaria*) advanced emergence 18–22 days; adult size unchanged.  
• **Adult overwinterers** (e.g., *Megachile pugnata*) lost 14–19 % body mass; lifespan shortened 30 %; fecundity fell 27 %.  
• Implication: community composition may shift toward prepupal strategists.

#### 4.3.2 Climate‐Chamber *Osmia cornuta* / *O. bicornis* (Learning #3)

• Regimes: 2 °C, 6 °C, 10 °C.  
• Warmer regimes → emergence 12–26 days earlier, but **overwinter mass loss doubled** (avg 11 mg vs. 5 mg).  
• Across all treatments, **smaller individuals delayed emergence**, suggesting an adaptive filter—yet warm winters still yield lighter bees overall, eroding fitness.

## 5 | Mechanistic Synthesis

1. **Metabolic theory** predicts exponential consumption of lipid or honey stores with temperature; specific Q10 values from respirometry align with observed mass loss.  
2. **Neuro-endocrine axis**: Insulin/FOXO pathway integrates nutritional state and thermal cues; dysregulation at high winter T triggers premature diapause termination.  
3. **Energetic cliff**: For honey bees, store depletion below ~7–9 kg honey triggers cluster temperature collapse; model threshold reached ≈18 days sooner per +2 °C winter warming in continental climates.  
4. **Phenological mismatch modelling**: Coupled bee–plant degree-day models show plants advance 0.6–0.8 d °C⁻¹ vs. 1.0–1.3 d °C⁻¹ for bees, yielding mismatches that peak in late-successional forest biomes.  
5. **Carry-over effects**: Smaller post-emergence body size correlates with (i) forage range (~body mass^0.5), (ii) resistance to pesticides/pathogens, amplifying climate impacts.

## 6 | Downstream Ecological & Socioeconomic Consequences

• Reduced pollinator availability during early bloom (e.g., fruit trees) → documented 5–15 % fruit set losses in Italian almond orchards in warm-winter 2020.  
• Community reassembly: dominance of cavity‐nesting *Osmia* spp. over ground-nesters in areas with diminished snow cover.  
• Economic cost: US overwinter honey-bee losses 30–45 % since 2006; climate factors account for ~8 % of total colony replacement cost (≈US$ 40 M y⁻¹).  
• Ecosystem feedbacks: earlier bee emergence can advance plant phenology via pollination stimulation, potentially locking in mutual advances or causing cascade failures if one partner lags.

## 7 | Mitigation and Adaptation Options

| Scale | Intervention | Evidence & Predicted Efficacy |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Apiary | Insulated hive wraps; ventilation control to stabilise 5–8 °C internal T | Reduces honey consumption 10–21 %; Austrian trials cut mortality 12 % |
| Apiary | Dynamic store supplementation based on degree-day forecast | Algorithms flag 10-day early feed need; pilot reduced 2024 starvation events 30 % |
| Breeding | Select lines with higher critical thermal minima (CTmin) and Varroa-sensitive hygienic behaviour | Double-trait selection yielded 6 % lower winter loss across 5 generations |
| Landscape | Heterogeneous floral resources spanning March–April to buffer mismatch | 1-ha early bloom strips ↑ *Bombus* queen survival 18 % in UK trial |
| Conservation | Preserve north-facing talus slopes and woody debris for cooler overwinter refugia | Bumblebee queen occupancy 4× higher in shaded microsites |
| Policy | Incorporate overwinter risk indices into crop-pollination insurance | Reduces financial exposure, incentivises best management practices |

## 8 | Knowledge Gaps & Priority Research

1. **Pathogen–climate interactions**: Quantify how warmer winters modulate DWV, Nosema proliferation in honey bees; integrate into mechanistic survival models.  
2. **Sub‐lethal pesticide synergy**: Determine whether thermal stress exacerbates pesticide detoxification costs during diapause.  
3. **Tropical highlands**: Virtually no data on overwinter dynamics where seasonality is rainfall-driven; critical for Andean and East African stingless bees.  
4. **Genomic plasticity mapping**: Use ATAC-seq to identify regulatory elements enabling rapid diapause plasticity; targets for selective breeding or gene editing.  
5. **Forecasting tools**: Develop open-source, real-time spatio-temporal risk dashboards combining ERA5 reanalysis and IPM lite models for beekeepers and land managers.

## 9 | Conclusions

Climate change is **already reshaping the overwintering landscape for bees**, with warm winters shortening diapause, draining energy reserves, and intensifying phenological mismatches. The magnitude and direction of effects are **taxon- and life-stage specific**: honey bees suffer when warm spells are punctuated by late cold shocks, whereas solitary bees that overwinter as adults endure chronic energetic stress under sustained warmth. Although bees exhibit some plasticity—e.g., body-condition gating of emergence—the rate of climatic change outpaces compensatory mechanisms for many populations.

Actionable solutions exist, from microclimatic buffering to phenology-aware landscape design, yet **integration of climatic signals into everyday management remains limited**. Bridging this gap requires transdisciplinary collaboration, high-resolution monitoring, and policy frameworks that internalise climate risk to pollination services.
