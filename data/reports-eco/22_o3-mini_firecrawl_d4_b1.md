# Final Report: The Impact of Snack Provision on Volunteer Retention

## Introduction

The question of whether providing snacks increases the chance that a volunteer returns to volunteer again is nuanced and multifaceted. This report synthesizes multiple research learnings and methodological insights across domains—ranging from organizational wellness programs to community-based participatory research—to explore and elucidate the potential causal relationship between snack incentives and volunteer return rates. Given the diversity of volunteer contexts (nonprofit organizations, event volunteers, healthcare settings, etc.), and considering potential confounding variables such as type, quality, and frequency of snacks provided alongside other elements like recognition and scheduling flexibility, this report outlines a comprehensive approach to isolating and evaluating the efficacy of snack incentives.

## Literature Review and Conceptual Frameworks

### 1. Reward Preferences and Motivational Outcomes

Recent studies in organizational wellness programs have revealed a critical mismatch between preferred and effective incentives. For example, although cash incentives are often cited as the most popular reward among employees, gift cards have been associated with superior performance outcomes. By analogy, while volunteers might express a preference for a certain type of snack, the motivational impact might differ from the superficial appeal. The key insight here is that the *type* and *quality* of the incentive (snack, in this case) may matter less than how it is integrated into broader recognition systems and organizational culture.

### 2. Comparative Effectiveness of Consumable vs. Non-Monetary Incentives

Research on out-of-school time snack interventions has shown that targeted consumable incentives can alter behavior in predictable ways. Interventions that provided grocery-store discounts on healthy snacks not only increased the frequency of consumption but also improved the diversity of healthy offerings. Translating these findings to volunteer retention suggests that snack incentives may serve as a behavioral nudge. However, it remains crucial to compare these incentives with other non-monetary rewards (e.g., recognition programs) to ascertain their relative efficacy in increasing return rates.

### 3. Advanced Methodological Designs

The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report exemplifies the integration of multiple data sources—USDA food patterns, NHANES data—and advanced statistical models such as difference‐in‐differences. These methodological innovations provide a blueprint for designing studies that can isolate the effect of snack incentives on volunteer retention. By using rigorous causal evaluation designs (e.g., randomized control trials, cluster‐randomized trials, or natural experiments), researchers can rigorously control for confounding variables, such as overall volunteer satisfaction, scheduling flexibility, and nutritional quality of the snacks offered.

### 4. Multi-Level Community Engagement Frameworks

Models like the Social–Ecological Model, Diffusion of Innovation, and Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) underscore the importance of contextual factors in designing effective interventions. These frameworks reinforce that volunteer retention is influenced by multiple layers including individual motivation, interpersonal relationships, institutional policies, and broader societal norms. Tailoring snack interventions to local contexts (e.g., cultural-specific dietary preferences) can not only increase immediate participation but also engender longer-term commitment as volunteers perceive the gesture as part of a broader narrative of care and recognition.

### 5. Insights from Field Experiments and Voluntary Engagement Models

Field experiments in volunteer settings—exemplified by the greeting‐card coloring study—demonstrate that non‐monetary incentives such as performance feedback or participatory decision-making (like voting on fund allocation) can boost output significantly. The takeaways from these experiments offer critical lessons: the mode of delivery and the context in which incentives are provided matter greatly. Snack incentives, particularly when they are framed as part of a broader appreciation package (including mentoring breakfasts or leadership training as seen in the SEACSM 2023 Annual Meeting), could have synergistic effects on volunteer retention.

### 6. Incorporating Causal and Economic Evaluations

Rigorous evaluations in obesity prevention and other health domains have relied on multifaceted randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-ups. The utility of cluster randomized designs and subgroup analyses (via mixed-effects models, random-effects meta-analysis) is particularly instructive here. These advanced statistical techniques help account for demographic and contextual heterogeneity, allowing researchers to parse out the independent effect of snack incentives from other concurrent influences. Furthermore, integrating risk-of-bias assessments (e.g., Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and GRADE criteria) and economic evaluations helps ensure that observed effects are both statistically robust and cost-effective.

## Methodological and Analytical Considerations

### 1. Experimental Design and Metrics

For researchers interested in evaluating snack provision as an incentive, a multi-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) could be designed. This trial might include:

- **Intervention Group 1:** Volunteers receive high-quality, nutritious snacks during their shifts.
- **Intervention Group 2:** Volunteers receive snacks along with additional non-monetary incentives, such as public recognition or decision-making input regarding resource allocation.
- **Control Group:** Volunteers do not receive snacks, but continue with the usual form of rewards (if any).

Metrics to assess include not just return rates but also subjective measures of satisfaction, perceived organizational support, and even health or wellness outcomes. Using a difference‐in‐differences approach can help isolate the causal impact by comparing changes over time across these different groups.

### 2. Accounting for Confounding Variables

The research design should also integrate controls for various extraneous factors:

- **Scheduling Flexibility:** How volunteer shifts align with personal schedules and the effect of flexible scheduling on volunteer satisfaction and retention.
- **Volunteer Recognition:** Investigating whether simultaneous non-monetary rewards like public acknowledgment or mentoring sessions interact with snack provision to enhance retention.
- **Environmental and Cultural Contexts:** Adapting the intervention to fit local dietary customs and preferences to ensure that snack provisions are not only nutritious but also culturally relevant.

Statistical methods such as instrumental variable (IV) analysis or mediation analysis could be utilized to understand the interplay between these variables, particularly in teasing apart direct and indirect effects on retention outcomes.

### 3. Frameworks for Implementation and Evaluation

Adopting community engagement frameworks such as CBPR allows for collaborative design, ensuring that interventions are contextually appropriate and ethically sound. More so, implementing a participatory evaluation—where volunteers provide feedback on the intervention—can help fine-tune the operational aspects of the incentive program. This real-time iterative feedback loop is crucial for adjusting parameters such as snack quality, portion sizes, and frequency of provision.

## Alternative Perspectives and Additional Considerations

### 1. Non-Traditional Incentives

While the central focus is on snacks, the research learnings suggest that alternatives (e.g., gift cards, performance feedback, and structured mentoring sessions) have demonstrated significant positive outcomes. A comparative study that pits snack incentives directly against these alternatives could reveal important insights into their relative efficacy and combined effects when administered as part of a broader incentive package.

### 2. Social and Behavioral Dimensions

The social return activity (the perceived net benefit in terms of well-being and community building) extends beyond the nutritional value of the snack. Volunteers might view the provision of snacks as a symbol of care and appreciation, thereby increasing their intrinsic motivation to continue volunteering. Advanced qualitative studies through interviews or focus groups can capture these psychosocial dynamics in detail.

### 3. Scalability and Economic Evaluation

Deploying snack incentives across large-scale volunteer programs raises questions about cost-effectiveness and sustainability. An economic evaluation that includes cost-benefit analysis and sensitivity analysis will be essential to ascertain the long-term viability of snack-based incentives. This analysis should also consider opportunity costs and clarify whether resources might yield higher retention through alternative investments in volunteer recognition or development programs.

### 4. Integration with Health and Wellness Initiatives

A potential innovative angle—often overlooked—is integrating snack incentives with broader health and wellness programs. For instance, providing nutritionally balanced snacks aligned with guidelines (akin to those from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee) might not only bolster retention but also promote volunteer health. This dual objective could be particularly appealing in settings where volunteers are drawn from health-related or community service sectors that prioritize personal well-being.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

The question of whether snack provision increases volunteer return rates is complex and contingent upon multiple variables. Based on the research learnings discussed, the following conclusions can be drawn:

- **Multifactorial Interventions:** Snack incentives, when combined with other supportive factors like flexible scheduling and recognition programs, are more likely to enhance volunteer return rates. A systems-based intervention that accounts for the local context and uses participatory design methods is essential.

- **Rigorous Experimental Design:** Utilizing randomized controlled trials and advanced statistical models (e.g., mixed-effects models, instrumental variable techniques) will help isolate the specific impact of snack incentives from other confounding variables.

- **Cultural and Contextual Tailoring:** The dietary quality, cultural relevance, and presentation of snacks matter. Tailoring snack incentives to the specific needs and preferences of the volunteer pool may yield better engagement than a one-size-fits-all approach.

- **Economic and Health Synergies:** There are potential synergies in integrating snack provision with broader health and wellness programs. Future studies should explore if nutritionally-framed snack incentives can serve dual purposes by enhancing both volunteer retention and overall volunteer well-being.

- **Future Research Directions:** Further research is needed to compare snack incentives directly with other forms of non-monetary or mixed incentives. Exploratory studies that stratify outcomes by demographic or setting-specific subgroups (e.g., childcare vs. school environments) could provide deeper insights. Additionally, embedding qualitative research will add depth by elucidating volunteer perceptions about snack incentives and overall satisfaction.

In summary, while the direct causal impact of snack provision on volunteer retention remains to be fully quantified, existing evidence suggests that snack incentives, particularly when integrated into a holistic volunteer support framework, have the potential to enhance repeat volunteer participation. Future research should focus on design optimization, economic feasibility, and synergistic benefits with overall volunteer well-being initiatives.
