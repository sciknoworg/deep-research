# Designing a **Field-Realistic** Pesticide-Exposure Experiment for Bees – Final Technical Report

*(All concentration units are given as µg kg⁻¹ ≡ parts-per-billion, ppb, unless otherwise noted)*

---

## 1  Executive Summary

The central experimental design challenge is to select a **concentration gradient that is simultaneously (i) realistic for the chosen exposure route, (ii) spans the sub-lethal window where the most sensitive behavioural and colony endpoints respond, and (iii) remains analytically quantifiable** with state-of-the-art LC–MS/MS methods.  
Leveraging the full body of residue data and effect thresholds compiled in the literature (12 key findings, 1998-2024), the following pesticide ranges emerge as *defensible and informative* starting points for imidacloprid (the most intensively documented active ingredient):

| Matrix / Exposure Mode | Recommended Test Levels | Rationale |
|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| Sucrose syrup (adult oral) | 0 (control), 1, 5, 20, 50, 100 ppb | 1–5 ppb = *ambient* in seed-treated crops; 20–50 ppb = soil/fertigation residues; 100 ppb = lower bound for adverse colony-scale effects in arid climates |
| Pollen paste (adult + brood oral) | 0, 5, 20, 50, 100 ppb | Brood deficits & overwinter failure emerge ≥20 ppb; cognitive deficits at ~4 ppb/larva; 100 ppb stresses colonies but avoids acute kill |
| Topical/contaminated dust | 0, 0.1, 1, 10 µg bee⁻¹ (≈0, 1 × 10⁴, 1 × 10⁵, 1 × 10⁶ ppb) | Drill dust releases 120–240 µg g⁻¹; contact dosage on marginal flora estimated 0.2–3 µg bee⁻¹; gradient captures sub-acute to knock-down |
| Larval micro-dosing | 0, 0.04, 0.4, 4, 24 ng larva⁻¹ | 0.04 ng already impairs learning; >24 ng collapses brood |

The table assumes **Apis mellifera worker adults/larvae**; if the target is *Bombus* or solitary bees, divide the oral-diet concentrations by ~1.5–2 to obtain equivalent per-body-mass doses.  Analytical LOQs of 1–5 ppb (LC-ESI-MS/MS or LC-APCI-MS/MS) are sufficient to verify treatment compliance and residual kinetics.

## 2  Clarifying the Experimental Scope

Before finalising any dosing scheme, three foundational decisions must be locked in:

1. **Active ingredient / formulation** – Imidacloprid (a nitro-guanidine neonicotinoid) is chosen here because (a) its environmental residue data set is the densest, (b) it remains a global benchmark molecule for systemic insecticides, and (c) contemporary analytical methods can reach sub-ppb LOQs for it and its two key metabolites (5-OH-imidacloprid, olefin-imidacloprid).
2. **Exposure route & matrix** – The biologically plausible matrices for bee exposure are nectar, pollen, water (guttation), soil-derived dust, seed-treatment exhaust, and topical sprays.  Each has a distinct empirical residue distribution.  Most chronic-effect studies now focus on *nectar-equivalent sucrose syrup* and *pollen paste* because they (i) are straightforward to dose homogeneously, (ii) map onto daily ingestion rates, and (iii) can be linked to colony-level endpoints.
3. **Bee species / life stage** – Adult worker honey-bees and larvae are the default regulatory organisms, but bumble-bee queens, solitary bee larvae, or drone brood may be the actual ecological receptor of interest.  Adult A. mellifera are 100–120 mg fresh mass, larvae 150–180 mg at capping; *Bombus impatiens* workers are typically 200–250 mg; *Osmia bicornis* larvae ~30–40 mg.  Dose normalisation must reflect these scaling factors.

## 3  What Constitutes “Field-Realistic”? – Survey of Residue Datasets

### 3.1 Seed Treatment Pathway

1. **Wheat benchmark (Confidor 200 SL)** – 0.015 g a.i. per 25 g seed (≈0.6 g kg⁻¹ coating rate) delivered *non-detect* residues (<LOQ = 5–10 ppb) in harvested grain and straw (Learning 1).
2. **Sunflower & oilseed rape (Gaucho®)** – Schöning et al. 2003 found <5 ppb in nectar, pollen, petals, leaves, caged-bee tissues using a 0.005–0.01 mg kg⁻¹ LOQ method (Learning 2 & 4).  Effectively, **for seed-treated dicots the steady-state nectar concentration clusters around 1–3 ppb**, albeit with rare spikes up to ~10 ppb (Learning 6).

### 3.2 Soil Drench / Fertigation

• In *Cucurbita pepo* (squash) fertigated pre-bloom, nectar carried 10 ± 3 ppb imidacloprid; pollen 14 ± 8 ppb (Learning 10).  The systemic uptake is roughly 4–6× higher than from equivalent seed treatments.

### 3.3 Foliar / Spray Pathway

• Direct foliar applications are intentionally avoided in most “field realistic” bee studies because even low label rates overshoot typical nectar residues by two orders of magnitude.  If topical exposure is of interest, spray deposition simulations (0.1–10 µg bee⁻¹) are justified as a **worst-case** scenario (Learning 7 & 12).

### 3.4 Dust Drift During Sowing

• Pneumatic sowing of Gaucho-coated maize releases **120–240 µg g⁻¹** of drill dust in the exhaust plume within minutes (Learning 7 & 12).  Bees foraging adjacent flora can intercept **0.2–3 µg a.i. per bee per flight** (modelling + field wipe data), indicating the need for a contact-exposure tier at ≥1 µg bee⁻¹.

### 3.5 Water & Guttation Drops

Not covered in the supplied learnings, but external datasets place guttation droplets of corn at 10–100 ppb early in the day; nonetheless, syrup/pollen tiers already bracket these values.

## 4  Effect Thresholds Across Biological Scales

| Biological Endpoint | Threshold Concentration / Dose | Supporting Learning(s) |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Adult mortality (acute LD₅₀, 24 h, oral) | ~4,000 ppb (4 mg kg⁻¹) | Standard OECD dossiers, not in supplied learnings |
| Adult thermoregulation & colony weight variability | 100 ppb syrup over 6 weeks (arid AZ) produced measurable decline (Learning 3) |
| Adult foraging activity – facilitation hormesis | 5 ppb syrup *slightly improved* foraging metrics in same study (Learning 3) |
| Larval olfactory learning deficit | 0.04 ng larva⁻¹ (≈4 ppb in a 10 µL cell) (Learning 5) |
| Brood-cap collapse | >24 ng larva⁻¹ (Learning 5) |
| Colony overwinter survival | 20–100 ppb pollen for 5 weeks reduced survival to 59–61 % vs. 86 % control (Learning 11) |
| Varroa load / queen loss | Increased at 20–100 ppb pollen (Learning 11) |

Key insight: **Behavioural and colony-level endpoints respond at concentrations two orders of magnitude below acute LD₅₀s.** For design efficiency, therefore, the test range should emphasise 1–100 ppb, not 1–10 ppm, except in dedicated acute-toxicity tiers.

## 5  Analytical & Quality-Assurance Considerations

1. **LC–ESI-MS/MS (Schöning et al.)** – LOQ 5–10 ng g⁻¹ (ppb) with 91–97 % recovery, RSD 6–9 %.  Suitable for verifying 1–100 ppb target levels in nectar/pollen and for confirming parts-per-billion compliance in control diets (Learnings 2, 4, 8).
2. **LC–APCI-MS/MS (Bonmatin et al.)** – LOD 0.1 ng g⁻¹, LOQ 1 ng g⁻¹ (Learning 9).  Necessary if the study aims to *differentiate* between 1 ppb and sub-ppb residues, as required for hormesis or micro-dosing tiers.
3. **Sample size** – For <5 ppb verification, pools of ≥5 g nectar/pollen are needed, translating to ≈2,500 honey-bee foragers per sample.  Plan accordingly.

               |  Nectar/Syrup  |  Pollen  |  Larval Direct  |  Topical Dust |  Replicates
---------------+----------------+----------+-----------------+---------------+------------
Control        |      0         |    0     |       0         |      0        |     ≥6

```

• **Latin-square rotation** of cages/colonies across environmental chambers or field apiary plots to control for microclimate variance.  
• Minimum of **six full-sized colonies (or 15 micro-nuc cages) per treatment** to hit 80 % power for ±20 % difference in brood area or adult population at α = 0.05.

### 6.2 Duration & Sampling Frequency

• Adult oral tier: 42 days (≈2 brood cycles) continuous feeding.  
• Brood / pollen tier: 35 days discrete exposure, followed by 60 days depuration to capture delayed demographic failure (Learning 11).  
• Topical dust tier: single exposure + 96 h acute observation, then 14-day recovery.

### 6.3 Endpoints

1. Colony population metrics: adult counts, brood area, queen laying pattern.  
2. Thermoregulatory stability via wired brood-nest temperature probes (Learning 3).  
3. Foraging traffic via hive-scale weight traces (Learning 3).  
4. Neurobehavioural assays on emerged workers (Proboscis Extension Reflex) to track larval exposure legacy (Learning 5).  
5. Pathogen/parasite synergism: Varroa mites and *Nosema* spore counts (Learning 11).  
6. Residue depuration: honey, wax, beebread at 0, 14, 28, 60, 180 d post-treatment (Learning 3 & 11).

## 7  Alternative or Complementary Test Compounds (Speculative)

Although imidacloprid remains the reference molecule, **new chemistries such as sulfoximine (sulfoxaflor) or butenolide (flupyradifurone) insecticides share similar systemic profiles but possess distinct binding kinetics at the nAChR receptor.**  A *comparative equi-toxic* design could replace the highest imidacloprid tier (50–100 ppb) with molar-equivalent sulfoxaflor or flupyradifurone doses to probe whether colony-level outcomes track receptor binding affinity or simply total cholinergic load.  
*Flagged as speculative* – residues for these actives in floral matrices are still emerging, so “realistic” ranges would need pre-study screening.

---

## 8  Contrarian & Forward-Looking Considerations

1. **Hormesis & biphasic responses** – The 5 ppb *positive* foraging effect (Learning 3) exemplifies the possibility that *ultra-low* doses (<1 ppb) might yield yet-undocumented stimulatory or priming effects. An exploratory sub-ppb tier (0.1 ppb) could therefore be informative, provided analytics permit.
2. **Synergism with fungicides (e.g., propiconazole) or acaricides (coumaphos)** – Not covered in supplied learnings but repeatedly shown to elevate neonic toxicity 2–5× via P450 inhibition. A full factorial may be prohibitive, yet including a single co-exposure tier would markedly improve ecological relevance.
3. **Climate modulation** – The Arizona vs. temperate difference in Learning 3 hints at dehydration/heat stress interactions.  A dual-climate chamber design (35 °C/20 % RH vs. 25 °C/60 % RH) could disentangle this.

---

## 9  Risk-Management & Regulatory Context

• Under current EU guidance (EFSA Bee Guidance Document, draft 2023) *Tier-II semi-field* studies must justify concentration selection with *measured* rather than *label* residues.  The ranges in Table 1 satisfy this using the aggregated dataset from Learnings 1-12.  
• The **“No Observed Adverse Effect Concentration” (NOAEC)** for colony endpoints appears to be ~5 ppb for syrup and ~10 ppb for pollen in temperate regions.  Any novel chemistry claiming superior bee safety must demonstrably shift this NOAEC upward.

---

## 10  Synthesis & Recommendations

1. **Primary concentration window: 1–100 ppb** across nectar and pollen simulations captures the full gradient from background seed-treatment residues to the lower bound of adverse colony impacts observed in arid climates.
2. **Include dust-contact tier (0.1–10 µg bee⁻¹)** to address an exposure route that may dominate in maize landscapes, yet is seldom covered in chronic feeding studies.
3. **Analytical capacity must reach ≤1 ppb LOQ** to police cross-contamination and verify sub-ppb hormesis tiers.
4. **Run at least two brood cycles** post-exposure to catch delayed demographic perturbations; queen failure in late summer is a leading real-world symptom (Learning 11).
5. **Optional comparative chemistry module** – Substitute high tiers with sulfoxaflor/flupyradifurone to future-proof findings relative to regulatory shifts away from neonics.

With these design pillars, the experiment will be robust, defensible under current regulatory scrutiny, and yet sufficiently granular to reveal nuanced behavioural and colony-level impacts across the realistic exposure spectrum.

> **Bottom line:** If your goal is to mimic contemporary, real-world imidacloprid exposure in honey-bee colonies, a concentration gradient centred on 1–100 ppb in oral matrices, plus a µg-level contact tier, fully captures both the typical and the biologically critical extremes documented to date.
