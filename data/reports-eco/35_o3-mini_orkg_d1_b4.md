# Final Report: Mechanisms Driving the Biodiversity–Ecosystem Function Relationship in Non-Grassland Ecosystems

This report synthesizes detailed insights from decades of research into the mechanisms underpinning the biodiversity–ecosystem function (BEF) relationship across ecosystems beyond the classic grassland paradigm. While grassland studies have significantly informed our understanding of ecosystem functioning, extending this research to forests, aquatic systems, agricultural landscapes, and other habitat types reveals a complex interplay of biotic interactions and abiotic drivers, as well as the need for innovative modeling approaches. This report integrates findings from empirical studies, theoretical modelling, and a benchmarking 28‐year co‐occurrence analysis to provide a comprehensive analysis of these multifaceted mechanisms.

## 1. Introduction

The BEF relationship is integral to understanding how species diversity affects ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and overall ecosystem stability. Traditional BEF research has predominantly focused on grassland systems, often emphasizing random species assembly. However, ecosystems such as forests, freshwater aquatic systems, and agricultural lands exhibit vastly different community dynamics, environmental heterogeneity, and interaction networks. In this context, our analysis focuses on:

- **Biome-specific mechanisms**: Understanding how processes differ between ecosystems, including unique community assembly rules.
- **Biotic vs. abiotic drivers**: Disentangling the influences of interspecific interactions (competition, facilitation) versus external modulating environmental factors.
- **Empirical and theoretical integration**: Leveraging experimental data alongside emerging models and simulations that account for non-random, realistic community dynamics.

## 2. Distinct Domains and Key Observations Across Ecosystems

### 2.1 Aquatic Ecosystems

Aquatic environments are characterized by rapid biological processes and steep physiochemical gradients. Research indicates that the role of species’ functional traits is particularly significant here; the ecosystem functions are amplified through mechanisms such as propagule exchange and rapid nutrient cycling. Several key points include:

- **Trait Diversity and Dynamics**: Unlike grasslands where dominant species (mass ratio hypothesis) may drive functioning, aquatic systems rely on a more distributed trait diversity resulting in multifaceted responses to environmental change.
- **Trophic Cascades and Non-linear Dynamics**: Studies in regions like the Gulf of Riga highlight that multitrophic interactions involving non-linear trophic cascades significantly shape ecosystem outputs. Consumer and basal species diversity can stabilize or destabilize system functions, depending on environmental context.
- **Modeling Advances**: Integrative models that merge BEF with food web theory are emerging, allowing researchers to scale insights from micro-level experiments to larger management-relevant spatial scales.

### 2.2 Agricultural Landscapes and Managed Ecosystems

Agricultural landscapes are not only economically significant but also ecologically complex. The interplay between managed practices, soil fertility, and biodiversity yields profound insights:

- **Facilitative Root Systems**: In nutrient-poor or low-input agroecosystems, mechanisms such as nitrogen transfer via mycorrhizal mediation and exudate-driven modification of soil biochemistry promote ecosystem functioning. Facilitative interactions are enhanced by plant root systems, contributing to nutrient cycling and soil recovery.
- **Community Assembly and Realism**: A 28‐year analysis of BEF research across ecosystems has delineated that while many experiments use random species assembly, crucial differences emerge when realistic, non‐random community dynamics are incorporated into models, enhancing cross‐ecosystem applicability.
- **Spatial Heterogeneity**: Variance in soil characteristics and the impact of human-modified land covers modulate the BEF relationship. For instance, in agricultural and adjacent non-grassland systems, these abiotic factors can explain substantial variations in ecosystem multifunctionality.

### 2.3 Forest Ecosystems

Forests represent multi-strata, long-lived communities where biodiversity’s effect on ecosystem functions often reflects both competitive interactions and intricate facilitative dynamics:

- **Competitive Prevalence**: A global compilation of over 10,500 empirical plant interaction pairs shows that competition is the dominant interspecific interaction across non-grassland systems, including forests. Local conditions—such as microclimate, soil properties, and disturbance regimes—play a decisive role in shaping these outcomes.
- **Ecosystem Stability Through Diversity**: While competition dominates, certain multifunctional benefits arise from the balance between competitive and facilitative species interactions. Shifts in community composition, especially when influenced by microbial functional guilds, can alter key ecosystem processes such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling.

## 3. Mechanistic Drivers and Interactions: Biotic and Abiotic Networks

The mechanisms driving ecosystem functioning are rarely attributable to single factors; rather, they offer a networked result of multi-layered interactions.

### 3.1 Biotic Interactions

- **Competitive vs. Facilitative Dynamics**: Across non-grassland ecosystems, empirical evidence points to a preponderance of competitive interactions. However, facilitative interactions, particularly through root symbioses and microbial partnerships, are pivotal. The delicate balance between competition and facilitation can mediate ecosystem-level processes, ensuring resilience under stressed conditions.

- **Microbial Functional Guilds**: Interactions among microbial groups in the plant–soil complex are highly niche-driven. This results in a dynamic equilibrium where competition and facilitation coexist, stabilizing carbon and nutrient cycles. Understanding these interactions requires an integrated perspective that spans soil physics, biogeochemistry, and microbial community ecology.

- **Multitrophic Interactions and Eco‐Evolutionary Feedbacks**: Ecosystem functioning is also influenced by non-linear trophic cascades. Shifts in both consumer and basal species diversity—documented in long-term forest-grassland experimentation—can have contrasting and context-dependent effects on stability, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all approach to ecosystem management is inadequate.

### 3.2 Abiotic Drivers

- **Environmental Heterogeneity and Landscape Context**: Ecosystem functionality is not solely dictated by the inherent traits of species, but also by the landscape context in which they exist. Variability in soil chemistry, moisture levels, and human modification of land cover plays a role in modulating biodiversity’s effect on multifunctionality. In some cases, external abiotic factors explain as much as a fourfold variation compared to intrinsic plant diversity.

- **External Modulators in Agricultural Systems**: In managed ecosystems such as agroecosystems, nutrient inputs, irrigation regimes, and land-use history further complicate the BEF relationships. Incorporating these abiotic components into models elevates predictive accuracy regarding ecosystem responses to both natural and anthropogenic changes.

## 4. Modelling Innovations and Multiscale Analysis

To translate the rich empirical data into actionable insights, novel modelling approaches have been employed. A key advance has been the development of parsimonious models that incorporate random effects in univariate analyses alongside multivariate techniques. This approach, as demonstrated by studies from Maynooth University, has broad implications for assessing diversity effects in species‐rich systems beyond traditional grassland experiments.

### 4.1 Integrative Approaches

Researchers are increasingly combining BEF frameworks with food web theory and multitrophic eco‐evolutionary models. This integrative approach allows for:

- **Scaling from Micro- to Macro-Levels**: Linking small-scale experimental outcomes to large-scale ecosystem management and conservation efforts.
- **Incorporation of Realistic Community Dynamics**: Moving beyond random assembly to include observed species interactions and community structures, leading to more accurate predictions of ecosystem functioning in variable environments.
- **Adaptive Management Strategies**: Informing strategies that can dynamically adjust to ecosystem feedbacks, ensuring that management practices are both scientifically robust and contextually relevant.

### 4.2 Future Directions and Potential Innovations

Based on current trends and knowledge gaps, several promising areas for future research include:

- **Cross-Ecosystem Comparative Modelling**: Developing models that directly compare BEF mechanisms across various ecosystem types (forests, aquatic systems, agroecosystems) to identify universal drivers versus system-specific nuances.
- **Integrating Remote Sensing and High-Resolution Data**: Advancements in remote sensing technology could further elucidate landscape heterogeneity and environmental gradients, providing real-time data inputs into BEF models.
- **Experimental Manipulation of Multitrophic Interactions**: Controlled experiments designed to tease apart the effects of different trophic levels can offer deeper insights into how consumer–resource dynamics stabilize or destabilize ecosystem functioning in diverse settings.
- **Genomic and Metagenomic Approaches**: Incorporating microbial community genomics could uncover new layers of biodiversity influence, particularly in how microbial functional guilds drive nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration.

## 5. Conclusions

The biodiversity–ecosystem function relationship in non-grassland ecosystems is governed by a fine balance between competitive and facilitative biotic interactions and influenced heavily by abiotic context, such as soil properties and landscape heterogeneity. Across aquatic, agricultural, and forest ecosystems, mechanism-specific drivers – including rapid biological processes, nutrient cycling mediated by root and microbial interactions, and complex multitrophic cascade dynamics – have been identified as key moderators of ecosystem performance.

Integrative modeling approaches that couple empirical data with realistic community assembly dynamics present a promising avenue forward for enhancing the predictive power and applicability of BEF research across diverse ecosystems. Future research, particularly with advancements in remote sensing and genomic technologies, will likely further illuminate the intricacies of these relationships, ultimately guiding ecosystem management and conservation efforts in a more informed, adaptive manner.

Continual refinement of both theoretical and empirical methodologies is essential, as each ecosystem dynamics weave a unique narrative of how biodiversity influences, stabilizes, and occasionally destabilizes ecosystem functions. The challenge remains to reconcile scale-dependent findings with overarching principles—a task that requires collaborative efforts between modelers, field ecologists, and experimental biologists.
