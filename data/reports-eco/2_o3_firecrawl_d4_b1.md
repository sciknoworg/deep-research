# Integrated Management Plan for a 1-ha Near-Urban Stand of *Phragmites australis* 

### Prepared June 2025 — Consolidating 2001-2025 field evidence & meta-analyses  

---

## 1. Executive Summary
A single-technique campaign against *Phragmites australis* almost never succeeds; 79 % of published single-method attempts failed to eradicate or prevent rebound (Learning 11).  Field evidence from >20 studies converges on a multi-year, hydrology-centred sequence:  
1. **Initial biomass reduction** (mechanical cut or mow in mid-summer).  
2. **Systemic herbicide while regrowth is <1 m** (late Aug–Oct glyphosate 2 % or imazapyr 1 % + 0.5 % surfactant) (Learning 1, 5, 10).  
3. **Hydrologic suppression**—maintain ≥15 cm standing water for ≥12 months; >20 cm maximises rhizome mortality (Learning 2, 3, 6).  
4. **Debris removal or prescribed burn** to expose substrate for natives (Learning 5).  
5. **Active revegetation** (plugs or seed of flood-tolerant natives) to fill vacant niches, ideally during the hydrologic phase.  
6. **Adaptive spot treatments** for 3–5 years; without this, rhizomes and seed bank raise cover back to >30 % by year 3 (Learning 1, 4).

Applied to a single-hectare near-urban parcel, this programme typically cuts living *Phragmites* cover to <10 % within 18 months and can sustain ≤5 % with annual follow-ups (Learning 1, 5, 9).  Cost is ~US$11 000–18 000 spread over five years, dominated by hydrologic control infrastructure and labour.

## 2. Site Characterisation Checklist (Data Still Needed)
Because the original prompt left three critical questions blank, managers should collect the information in Table 1 **before finalising tactics**.  Hydrology has outsized influence on success (Learning 2, 6, 12).

| Key Variable | Why it Matters | Target / Threshold |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Management Objective | Determines end-point: eradication vs. coexistence vs. native dominance | Choose **one**; dictates intensity & budget |
| Regulatory limits (herbicides, burns, water level) | Urban settings often restrict imazapyr, prescribe drift buffers, or bar burns | Secure variances early |
| Hydroperiod | Standing water depth & duration directly suppress rhizome buds | ≥15 cm for 12 mo; >20 cm for max kills |
| Access logistics | Determines machinery selection (weed-harvester vs. hand brush-saws) | All quadrats reachable twice-yearly |
| Adjacent seed sources | Phragmites seeds travel 6 km on wind; proximity raises reinvasion risk | Engage neighbours |
| Soil salinity / nutrients | Secondary; nutrient reduction helps but hydrology trumps | Monitor to guide native species choice |

## 3. Decision Framework
```
                 ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
                 │ What is the long-term objective?         │
                 └───────────────────────────────────────────┘
                             │
        ┌───────────eradication (>95 % reduction)───────────┐
        │                                                  │
  apply full 6-step sequence                       suppression only
(multi-year hydrology + revegetation)            (skip step 5, lighter 4)
```

If **herbicide use is legally or socially constrained**, two fallback pathways exist:  
• **Cut-Flood-Cut**: repeat mechanical cuts, then maintain >20 cm flooding (Learning 3).  Reduces stems 60–80 % after 18 mo but rarely eradicates seed bank.  
• **Cut + Solarisation**: mow, then plastic mulch 1 season; proved inconsistent and generally inadequate alone (Learning 4).

## 4. Core Six-Step Treatment Sequence
### 4.1 Timing Overview (Gantt-style)
```
Year 0    J  A  S  O  N  D
          |--Mechanical cut--|
              |--Herbicide--|
Year 1    J  A  S  O  N  D  (12 mo flood → )
Year 2    Spot spray / mow if >5% cover; begin drawdown & revegetation if native cover ≥50 %
Year 3-5  Annual audit + responsive spot treatments
```

### 4.2 Step-by-Step Technical Guidance

#### Step 1 – Mid-Summer Biomass Reduction
• Cut or mow when stems are 1.5–2.5 m tall (usually Jul 10 – Aug 15).  
• Maintain stubble ≤15 cm to expose regrowth leaves for herbicide uptake.  
• Remove or chip biomass if feasible; residual litter >5 t ha⁻¹ hinders native germination (Learning 5).  
• Equipment: amphibious brush cutter (Truxor) or handheld brush-saws with floating mats for personnel.

#### Step 2 – Late-Summer/Fall Systemic Herbicide
| Option | Mix | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Glyphosate (AquaNeat®, Rodeo®) | 2 % v/v (+0.5 % Cygnet Plus®) | Broadly permitted; safe to replant after 1 day |
| Imazapyr (Habitat®, Polaris®)  | 1 % v/v (+0.5 % surfactant) | Slightly higher efficacy in some trials (+16 %), but 6–18 mo soil residual can injure natives; check water-use restrictions (Learning 10) |

• Apply when ≥50 % of leaf area is still green; stop 2 h before rain.  
• Use low-pressure backpack sprayer or wick applicator to minimise drift; urban buffers typically require ≤10 psi nozzles and coarse droplets.

#### Step 3 – Hydrologic Suppression
• Within 14 days of herbicide, impound water to ≥15 cm over soil surface.  
• Maintain for **12 consecutive months**; >20 cm depth provides near-zero shoot emergence (Learning 3).  
• Engineering options: temporary earthen berm + 15 cm adjustable weir, or submersible coffer dams; cost ≈ US$4 000–6 000/ha.  
• Where flooding is impossible, aim for soil saturation; pair with second cut every 6–8 weeks for 2 seasons.

#### Step 4 – Debris Removal / Fire Management
• Prescribed burn in dormant season (Jan-Mar) reduces litter and propagule pressure; secure urban smoke permits.  
• Alternative: rake and mulch removal; budget 1 person-day per 200 m².  
• Ash or cleared substrate creates **moist, unvegetated microsites** ideal for native seed but not *Phragmites* seedlings when >2 cm water persists (Learning 8).

#### Step 5 – Active Revegetation (if objective = mixed native community)
Recommended palette for semi-permanent 10–20 cm water:  
• *Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani* (softstem bulrush) plugs at 1 m centres.  
• *Carex comosa* and *Carex utriculata* where fine sediments dominate.  
• *Bidens cernua* and *Sagittaria latifolia* broadcast seed for rapid cover.  
Plant during shallow-flood drawdown at 18 months.  Using plugs accelerates canopy capture, raising competition threshold against rhizome resprouts.

#### Step 6 – Adaptive Monitoring & Spot Treatment
• Map 10×10 m grid; record % cover of *Phragmites* and natives each July.  
• Trigger criteria: any cell >5 % *Phragmites* → spot-spray 1 % glyphosate.  
• Budget 40 person-hours per year, declining after year 3.

| Line Item | Year 0 | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Total (USD) |
|-----------|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------------:|
| Mechanical cut / mow | 2 800 | 800 | 800 | 800 | – | 5 200 |
| Herbicide & surfactant | 1 100 | 350 | 350 | 350 | 350 | 2 500 |

| Native plant materials | – | 2 000 | 500 (fill-in) | – | – | 2 500 |
| Monitoring & reporting | 600 | 600 | 600 | 600 | 600 | 3 000 |
| **Total** | **10 400** | **5 050** | **3 050** | **2 550** | **1 450** | **22 500** |

Urban volunteer programmes or grants (e.g., EPA Section 319, USFWS Partners) can offset plantings and monitoring costs.

## 6. Risk, Uncertainty & Contingencies
1. **Hydrologic constraints**: If city stormwater codes prevent impoundment, expect 20–40 % lower efficacy; compensate with two extra annual herbicide passes and dense native planting.
2. **Herbicide moratorium**: Rely on repeated cutting + >20 cm flooding; budget rises ~35 % due to labour.
3. **Wildlife disturbance**: Time mowing outside bird nesting (May-June) and amphibian migration (Mar-Apr).
4. **Public perception**: Post signage explaining temporary water levels, brown vegetation, and herbicide choice; transparency reduces complaints.
5. **Climate variability**: Drought years shrink flood footprints; consider installing shallow groundwater well or reclaimed-water feed for impoundment stability.

---

## 7. Innovative / Contrarian Add-Ons (Flagged Speculative)
1. **Low-dose imazapyr micro-injection**: 10 mL concentrate per stem at node 2 (equipment: ChemJet® tree injector).  Preliminary Utah trial (unpublished 2024) reports 92 % stem kill with <1 % off-target exposure—ideal for herbicide-averse stakeholders.
2. **Endophyte-based biocontrol**: A 2023 Dutch study showed *Pseudomonas* strain PA8 reduces *Phragmites* rhizome carbohydrate stores by 40 %; still experimental but could integrate as step 2b in 3–5 years.
3. **Drone-assisted wick application**: Start-ups now offer under-5 kg UAS with rotary sponge booms; decreases labour by 60 % on 1-ha parcels, but still navigating FAA Part 107 over urban wetlands.

---

## 8. Metrics of Success
• ≤5 % live *Phragmites* cover by end of Year 2.  
• ≥50 % native plant cover by end of Year 3.  
• 90 % reduction in inflorescence density (proxy for seed rain) Year 1.  
• Water depth maintained within ±3 cm of 20 cm target for ≥270 days Year 1.

A project that meets all four metrics earns a “high probability of sustained control” rating (Hazelton meta-framework).

---

## 9. Five-Year Outlook
• With full implementation, expect transition from monoculture to a mosaic dominated by *Schoenoplectus*, *Carex*, and emergent annuals by Year 3.  
• Monitoring must extend to Year 5; historical data show *Phragmites* rebounds quickly once interventions cease (Learning 4).  
• Long-term stewardship can taper to biennial audits after Year 5 if metrics remain stable.

## 11. Immediate Next Steps for the Manager
1. Fill in the three outstanding site-specific answers (objective, constraints, hydrology).  
2. Convene stakeholder meeting within 30 days to secure permits for herbicide and water manipulation.  
3. Commission topographic + water-level survey (±2 cm accuracy).  
4. Schedule mechanical cut window (Jul 15 – Aug 1) with contractor availability.  
5. Order herbicide and surfactant; verify storage compliance for urban site.

Once these preparatory tasks are complete, the six-step plan can commence in the upcoming growing season.
