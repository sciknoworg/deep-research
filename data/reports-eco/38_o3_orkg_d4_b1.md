# What Is the Most Important Global‐Change Driver for Plant Communities? – A Multi-Scale Synthesis

*Date: 2025-06-02*

---

## 1  Framing the Question

The user’s clarifying questions (current vs. future importance; biome specificity; inclusion of socio-economic drivers) implicitly request a *truly global synthesis* that (i) separates contemporary observed impacts from 21st-century projections, (ii) spans all terrestrial biomes, and (iii) treats both direct biophysical and indirect socio-economic forces.  This report adopts that framing and builds on 11 focal “learnings” extracted from the recent literature and modelling breakthroughs.

### 1.1  Criteria for “Most Important”

1. **Magnitude of biodiversity impact** – measured as proportional loss of species richness, compositional turnover (β-diversity), functional/phylogenetic change or productivity shifts.
2. **Spatial extent** – percentage of the Earth’s land surface or biome area affected.
3. **Irreversibility/legacy** – persistence of the driver’s effects after mitigation stops.
4. **Rate of change** – speed at which plant communities experience detectable impacts.
5. **Interaction strength with other drivers** – amplification or dampening of co-occurring pressures.

## 2  Empirical Evidence for Contemporary (1970-2024) Impacts

### 2.1  Land-Use Change (LUC)

* **Global reach:** ~75 % of ice-free land is now directly modified; conversion frontiers persist in the tropics.
* **Magnitude:** The mp-SAR database (hdl:2066/246011, 2022) shows additive richness declines of 13–58 % depending on land-use category (cropland, secondary forest, rangeland) and nitrogen input.
* **Legacy:** Schimel et al. demonstrate that historical cultivation/fire suppression can override direct climate warming for decades.
* **Biome variation:** Mediterranean and grassland systems exhibit the largest proportional losses (Sala et al., 2000).

### 2.2  Atmospheric Nitrogen Deposition (N-dep)

* **Magnitude:** Observed eutrophication‐driven compositional shifts of up to 30 % in temperate grasslands; mp-SAR confirms additive declines with LUC.
* **Synergies:** DGVM–biogeochemical coupling shows that warming can *erase* biodiversity gains expected from 30–60 % N-dep cuts (French forest study).

### 2.3  Climate Change (CC)

* **Direct signals:** Shifts in phenology and upward/equatorward range boundaries are ubiquitous, yet the *dominant predictor of productivity and demography today is still local water balance* (Schimel et al.).
* **Disturbance mediation:** Amplified fire, drought die-back, and pest outbreaks embed CC effects within disturbance regimes rather than direct temperature means.

### 2.4  Biotic Exchange / Invasive Species (INV)

* **Incidence:** >13,000 vascular plant species naturalised outside their native ranges.
* **Hotspots:** Target-group-background MaxEnt models (PICE ≥ 0.40) converge on *southern Florida and the U.S. Southwest* as multi-species hotspots.
* **Data limitation:** Predictive skill plateaus once data completeness/evenness exceed PICE = 0.40, overriding parameter tuning.

### 2.5  Elevated CO₂ (eCO₂)

* **Fertilisation vs. nutrient constraint:** Net primary productivity gains often down-regulated by N and P limitation; biodiversity responses subtle and typically masked by LUC, CC, and N-dep.

**Contemporary Verdict – Land-Use Change dominates** when evaluated by magnitude, spatial extent and legacy.

## 3  Projected Future (2025-2100) Importance

Projections depend on socio-economic pathways (SSP/RCP) but certain patterns emerge.

### 3.1  Land-Use Change

* **Peak cropland hypothesis:** Under SSP1 and SSP2, global cropland area stabilises or declines after 2030; under SSP3 and SSP4 it expands by 7–12 M km², mainly in the Congo, Amazon and boreal zones.
* **Intensification vs. expansion:** Yield gap closures may shift the driver from area conversion (habitat loss) to *management intensity* (chemical, mechanical, hydrological alteration).

### 3.2  Climate Change

* **Warming trajectories:** 2.7–3.5 °C global mean under current policy pledges.
* **DGVM intercomparisons:** Model-to-model spread narrows for carbon fluxes but remains large for *disturbance modules* (fire, windthrow), the key conduit for CC effects on plant communities.
* **Tipping biomes:** Boreal forests and tropical montane systems show nonlinear transitions under >3 °C warming, exceeding land-use impacts locally.

### 3.3  Nitrogen & Other Elemental Cycles

* **Controls on eCO₂ response:** Nonlinear N cycling, often missing in DGVMs, mediates future productivity and biodiversity feedbacks.
* **Policy scenario:** North America and Europe continue downward N-dep trends (‒30 % by 2050), but South Asia and parts of Africa rise (+20 %), shifting the geographic centre of impact.

### 3.4  Invasives & Biotic Exchange

* **Trade explodes:** Global merchandise trade volume may double by 2060 (OECD), outpacing current biosecurity capacity.
* **Climate-matching:** Coupled MaxEnt/LPJ frameworks show expanding climatically suitable ranges for >70 % of high-risk invaders, especially C4 grasses and woody lianas.

### 3.5  Socio-Economic Megatrends

* Urbanisation (70 % global urban population by 2050) intensifies urban heat island niches for exotics.
* Policy fragmentation under SSP3 hinders coordinated habitat protection, amplifying LUC impacts.

**Projected Verdict – The *interaction* of Climate Change with Land-Use Change becomes decisive.**  Isolating one driver ignores strong CC × LUC non-additivity; however, land-use decisions remain the most direct lever societies can modulate in the near term.

## 4  Cross-Driver Interactions & Nonlinearities

1. **Drought × N × Fire:** Experiments and DGVM sensitivity runs show that combined water deficit and N enrichment can more than double fire-induced mortality relative to single drivers.
2. **Invasion Facilitation:** Disturbance from LUC (roads, fragmentation) increases propagule pressure; CC provides climatic pre-adaptation, creating *invasional meltdowns*.
3. **Legacy Lock-In:** Once altered, soil microbial communities and feedbacks can maintain a novel state independent of the initial driver intensity.

## 5  Modelling and Data Innovations

### 5.1  Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs)

* 2nd-generation DGVMs include vertical light competition and successional cohorts, but still under-represent invasion processes and interactive drivers.
* Multi-source trait databases, paleo records and high-resolution remote sensing are the next validation frontier.

### 5.2  Species Distribution Modelling (SDM)

* **MaxEnt advances:** Target-group background selection and rigorous regularisation sharpen predictions; *data quality (PICE) exceeds algorithmic tuning* in importance.
* Integration with DGVMs can embed demographic realism into invasion risk forecasts.

## 6  Contrarian & Emerging Drivers (Speculative)

* **Microplastic deposition** in soils: early evidence of root perturbation and altered mycorrhizal networks – potential medium-term driver flagged for surveillance.
* **Synthetic biology/CRISPR gene flow:** Accidental spread of engineered traits could shift competitive hierarchies; currently low probability but high impact.
* **Solar geoengineering side-effects:** Stratospheric aerosol injection would differentially alter PAR and diffuse light, potentially benefiting shade-tolerant understorey flora at the expense of open-habitat species.

## 7  Management Implications & Solutions

1. **Land-Use Levers (Highest leverage, near term)**
   * Zero-deforestation supply chains; spatially explicit land-sparing vs. land-sharing optimisation.
   * Restore historical fire regimes in fire-suppressed biomes to counter woody encroachment.
2. **Nitrogen Management**
   * Precision agriculture and controlled-release fertilisers could reduce reactive N losses by ≥40 %.
3. **Climate Adaptation for Plant Communities**
   * Assisted migration corridors prioritised for climate-sensitive montane and boreal species.
4. **Biosecurity & Invasion Prevention**
   * Deploy PICE-guided surveillance networks in forecast hotspots (Florida, U.S. Southwest, Mediterranean islands).
5. **Modelling & Data Priorities**
   * Embed high-resolution invasion modules into DGVMs; validate with distributed manipulative experiments.
   * Mandate FAIR data deposition of plant monitoring and trait datasets to improve PICE scores globally.
6. **Socio-Economic Instruments**
   * Align biodiversity targets with agricultural subsidy reform to decouple commodity demand from habitat conversion.

## 8  Key Knowledge Gaps

1. Quantification of *interactive* LUC × CC × N effects beyond temperate case studies.
2. Representation of nonlinear nitrogen cycles in global vegetation-climate models.
3. Fine-scale disturbance (fire, storm, pest) modules that operate within 0.25° DGVM grids.
4. Monitoring networks in under-sampled biomes (Congo Basin, Central Asian steppes) to lift PICE ≥ 0.40 worldwide.

## 9  Synthesis Answer

*From 1970 to the present, **Land-Use Change is the single most important global driver of plant-community composition and richness** – it scores highest on magnitude, spatial extent, and legacy criteria.*  This conclusion is robust across biomes and data sources, including the mp-SAR meta-analysis and Sala et al. (2000), and is reinforced by evidence that LUC legacies can dominate even where direct climate signals are strong (Schimel et al.).

*Looking forward to 2100, **the combined interaction of Land-Use Change and Climate Change will emerge as the dominant force**, with Climate Change likely overtaking LUC in some tipping-prone biomes if high-end warming (>3 °C) materialises.*  However, because land-use decisions remain the most tractable anthropogenic lever and condition the severity of other drivers (N-dep targets, invasion pathways, climate resilience), land-use policy continues to offer the highest leverage for safeguarding global plant diversity.

### Recommended Next Actions for Expert Analysts

1. Conduct a *cross-driver variance partitioning* using 2nd-generation DGVM outputs paired with mp-SAR data to quantify additive vs. interactive contributions at biome and ecoregion scales.
2. Develop an *Open Invasion Hotspot Dashboard* incorporating PICE metrics and trade-route risk to guide real-time biosecurity interventions.
3. Engage in the *CMIP7-Biodiversity* working group to ensure that next-round climate models feed disturbance-explicit vegetation modules constrained by trait and paleo data.
4. Pilot *financial incentives* for land-use zoning that embeds connectivity corridors, targeting Mediterranean-climate and grassland biomes flagged as highest risk.
