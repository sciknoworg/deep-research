# Does Mycorrhizal Inoculation Increase Plant Biomass? — A 2025 State-of-Knowledge Synthesis

*Version: 2025-06-02*

---

## 1  Executive Summary

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and other mycorrhizal guilds form symbioses with ~90 % of terrestrial plant species, potentially boosting nutrient acquisition, drought tolerance and pathogen resistance.  The agronomic community, however, remains split between enthusiastic early adopters of commercial inocula and skeptics citing inconsistent field performance.

A 2025 meta-analysis synthesising 1 633 field observations (117 peer-reviewed studies, 2000-2023) now provides the clearest quantitative answer yet: **AMF inoculation increases above-ground plant biomass and/or economic yield by a mean of 20.1 % under field conditions**, with strong but predictable context-dependence.  The effect size on total biomass closely mirrors that on yield (R² = 0.91), justifying yield as an agronomic proxy for biomass gains in crops.

Key modifiers of the response are:

* **Host taxonomy** — Leguminosae (+27 %) > Solanaceae (+22 %) ≈ Brassicaceae* (+7 %; poor hosts) > Gramineae (+11 %).
* **Soil chemistry** — Low Olsen-P (<8 mg kg⁻¹) and moderate mineral N (40–80 kg ha⁻¹) maximise benefit; heavy NP fertilisation eliminates or reverses the biomass gain.
* **Inoculum identity** — Single-species products outperform mixes by 8 percentage points; *Claroideoglomus* strains maximise root colonisation, but *Rhizophagus* and *Funneliformis* best translate colonisation into biomass/yield.
* **Climate** — Yield responsiveness correlates with cumulative growing-season degree-days and inversely with in-season rainfall (climate variables explain 38 % of yield variance, more than soil variables do).

Importantly, the distribution of observed responses is wide (–12 % to +40 %).  A Swiss on-farm dataset shows that soil-borne pathogen pressure alone accounts for one-third of this variability, dwarfing available P.  Decision models that incorporate key soil/pathogen diagnostics reach >80 % accuracy in predicting beneficial vs. neutral outcomes, indicating that **“smart targeting” of inoculation can mitigate the perceived inconsistency problem.**

Bottom line: *Yes*, mycorrhizal inoculation can increase plant biomass in the majority of agronomic contexts, but practitioners need to match inoculum, soil chemistry, fertiliser regime and pathogen profile to unlock the benefit.  Blanket application is economically risky; site-specific diagnostics are the emerging best practice.

## 2  Evidence Base in Detail

### 2.1  Global Field-Scale Meta-Analysis (2025)

| Outcome | Overall ln-response | Back-transformed % change | n (obs.) |
|---------|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Root colonisation | 0.82 ± 0.07 | +126 % | 1 356 |
| Plant P uptake | 0.104 ± 0.015 | +10.9 % | 689 |
| Above-ground biomass | 0.182 ± 0.021 | +19.9 % | 1 042 |
| Economic yield | 0.184 ± 0.019 | +20.1 % | 787 |

Random-effects mixed models revealed:

* Soil variables (pH, Olsen-P, CEC, texture) explain 52 % of variance in colonisation success but only 19 % of variance in biomass gain.
* Climate variables (mean temperature, PET, rainfall) explain 38 % of variance in biomass/yield response.
* Host family explains 21 % (biomass), inoculum genus 14 % (biomass) and their interaction 6 %.

No publication bias detected (Egger’s intercept = 0.67, p = 0.12).

### 2.2  Rotation Trial in Central Europe (4-year)

Design: corn–wheat–corn rotation on paired Luvisol (sandy loam, low fertility) vs. Gleysol (clayey, high fertility); treatments = AMF inoculation (Funneliformis + Rhizophagus) × N fertiliser (0, 80, 160 kg N ha⁻¹).  Key findings:

* Root colonisation increased 2.1–3.6× regardless of site or year.
* Grain yield increase up to +18.8 % observed only at 0–80 kg N on Luvisol; no effect under 160 kg N or on Gleysol.
* Partial budget analysis: break-even price of inoculation (€35 ha⁻¹) met only under low-N Luvisol scenario.

Interpretation: **Soil fertility and N management determine economic viability—AMF do not replace full fertiliser programmes.**

### 2.3  Swiss On-Farm Maize Survey (54 fields, 3 years)

• No P fertiliser applied to isolate mycorrhizal effect.  • Mycorrhizal Growth Response (MGR) distribution: –12 % to +40 %, mean +14 %.  • Multivariate redundancy analysis:

* 15 soil chem/physical vars + 13 fungal OTUs explain 86 % of MGR variance.
* Soil-borne pathogen abundance (Fusarium, Olpidium, Trichosporon) = 33 % of total variance.
* P availability explains <2 %.

A simple two-class decision model (inoculate vs. not) using four variables (Fusarium index, Olsen-P, sand %, water holding capacity) predicted positive MGR with 80–83 % accuracy.

Implication: **Pathogen-mediated protection, not P supply, may be the dominant mechanism in many field situations.**

## 3  Mechanistic Interpretation

1. **Nutrient acquisition** — AMF hyphae extend the depletion zone for immobile P and micronutrients (Zn, Cu), explaining the +10.9 % average P uptake boost.  This uptake scales roughly linearly with colonisation intensity until a saturation threshold (~35 % root length colonised).

2. **Pathogen suppression** — AMF induce systemic resistance, alter rhizosphere microbiomes, and physically occupy infection sites.  The Swiss survey underscores that fields with severe _Fusarium_ pressure derive the greatest biomass benefit.

3. **Stress buffering** — Hyphae improve soil aggregation and water extraction.  Meta-regression shows stronger biomass gains under water-limited climates (<450 mm in-season rainfall).

4. **Carbon cost vs. benefit** — Under high N + P supply, plants already optimise nutrient uptake, so the ~4–10 % carbon drain to mycorrhiza doesn’t yield a net biomass dividend, explaining neutral/negative results in high-input systems.

---

## 4  Controlled-Environment Studies vs. Field Reality

Greenhouse and growth-chamber trials routinely report >40 % biomass gains, roughly double the field mean.  Main reasons:

* Sterilised substrates remove background AMF, pathogens and nutrient heterogeneity, overstating inoculant effect.
* Pot volume limits root foraging, amplifying hyphal advantage.

Therefore, **field metrics—not pot experiments—should guide commercial decisions.**

## 5  Which Mycorrhizal Guilds Matter?

• **Arbuscular (AMF)** — dominate agriculture; clear evidence above.
• **Ectomycorrhizal (ECM)** — relevant to forestry; limited data suggest +12–25 % seedling biomass gains, especially under drought.  Inoculation logistics (spore slurries, nurse-pot seedlings) differ markedly from AMF products.
• **Ericoid & Orchid** — niche sectors (blueberries, orchids); inoculation can be transformational but species-specific; outside scope here.

Comparative trials across guilds are rare.  A 2024 Scandinavian study found that AMF inoculation had negligible effect on ECM host (birch), reinforcing host–guild specificity.

## 6  Economic & Operational Considerations

1. Cost of commercial AMF products: €25–60 ha⁻¹ (European prices, 2024).  Pay-back requires ≥5 % yield lift in maize (assumes €180 t⁻¹, 10 t ha⁻¹ yield).
2. Break-even more readily met in high-value horticulture (e.g., tomatoes, capsicum) where 2–3 % yield increase suffices.
3. Single-species inocula often cheaper per propagule and more efficacious; regulatory pathways easier (EU’s new 2024 biostimulant regulation lists _Rhizophagus irregularis_ as a “low-risk microorganism”).
4. Shelf life & quality control remain issues—viable propagule counts vary 10× across brands.

Best practice: **request third-party propagule quantification and pathogenic screening before purchase.**

## 7  Decision Framework for Practitioners

1. **Soil diagnostics**
   • Olsen-P, pH, mineral N, texture, water-holding.
   • Pathogen DNA qPCR panels (_Fusarium spp._, _Olpidium_, _Macrophomina_).
2. **Risk/Benefit Matrix**

| Soil P | Pathogen Load | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Low (<10 mg kg⁻¹) | High | Strongly inoculate |
| Low | Low | Conditional; consider crop value |
| High (>20 mg kg⁻¹) | High | Trial basis only |
| High | Low | Do **not** inoculate (likely negative) |

3. **Inoculum Selection**
   • Host-compatible strain (e.g., *Funneliformis mosseae* for cereals, *Rhizophagus irregularis* for legumes).
4. **Application Method**
   • Seed coating for small-seed grain; in-furrow granular for row crops; peat slurry dip for transplants.
5. **Fertiliser Management**
   • Re-optimise N and P rates downward by 10–25 % where inoculum is applied—both to capture synergy and to avoid carbon-drain penalty.

## 8  Knowledge Gaps & Research Priorities

1. **Longevity of introduced strains** — Do commercial AMF persist beyond one season?  Limited evidence suggests <10 % persistence after 18 months.
2. **Microbiome interactions** — High-resolution multi-omics can untangle AMF–bacteria–pathogen networks governing biomass outcome.
3. **ECM and ericoid crops** — Need meta-analyses comparable to AMF to inform blueberry and forestry sectors.
4. **Genotype × Inoculum matching** — Breeding programmes rarely select for mycorrhizal responsiveness; integrating such traits could double biomass gains.
5. **Regenerative agriculture synergies** — Cover crops and reduced tillage increase native AMF; does inoculation still pay under such systems?

---

## 9  Contrarian & Speculative Perspectives (Flagged)

• *Speculative*: CRISPR-edited crops expressing artificially elevated strigolactone exudation may recruit native AMF so effectively that inoculation becomes obsolete—pilot work in rice and tomato shows promise but raises ecological concerns.
• *Contrarian*: Some soil ecologists argue that inoculation is a zero-sum game, merely replacing native AMF taxa without net functional gain; the Swiss pathogen-centric findings partly counter this view but the debate remains open.
• *Frontier*: A 2025 start-up is commercialising “synthetic mycorrhizal consortia” combining AMF spores with helper bacteria (_Paenibacillus_, _Burkholderia_).  Early greenhouse data show synergistic biomass +60 %, yet independent field validation is pending.

## 10  Key Takeaways

1. **Average biomass/yield increase ≈ 20 %, but range –12 % to +40 %.**
2. **Site-specific diagnostics (nutrient & pathogen profiling) can predict outcomes with >80 % accuracy.**
3. **Economic viability hinges on moderate to low fertility systems and/or high-value crops.**
4. **Single-species inocula—especially _Rhizophagus irregularis_ and _Funneliformis mosseae_—are top performers.**
5. **Integrating inoculation with adjusted fertiliser rates and pathogen management delivers the most reliable biomass gains.**

### Recommended Next Actions for an Agronomic R&D Team

1. Deploy a two-season, multi-site factorial trial: Inoculum (✓/✗) × 3 P levels × 2 pathogen backgrounds (fumigated vs. natural) in the target crop.
2. Collect soil DNA to feed into predictive models and fine-tune inoculation decision rules.
3. Run a partial-budget economic analysis at current commodity prices; update annually.
4. Engage with inoculum suppliers to secure verified, high-propagule products and negotiate price based on viable counts.

Implementing these steps will move inoculation decisions from anecdote to evidence-driven management, maximising the probability that mycorrhizal technology genuinely translates into greater plant biomass and farm profitability.
