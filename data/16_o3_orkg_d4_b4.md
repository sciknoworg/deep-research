# Invasive Species, Pollination Networks and Native Pollinators in Tropical Mountains – A Synthesis

*Date: 3 June 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

Tropical montane systems contain some of the planet’s most functionally specialised and range‐restricted pollination mutualisms, yet they are increasingly permeated by invaders—plants, pollinators, predators and ants/wasps—that re-wire interaction networks, alter pollen flow and threaten native plant and pollinator demography.  This report integrates >80 primary findings (1998–2024) to build a mechanistic, empirical and management-oriented understanding of how invasive taxa disrupt these mutualisms.  Key insights include:

1. **Direct floral competition by alien pollinators is pervasive but context-dependent.** Honeybees and bumblebees frequently dominate visitation (>90 % of visits in some Andean, Caribbean, Cameroonian and Galápagos sites) yet their per-visit effectiveness ranges from full functional substitution (e.g. *Goetzea elegans*, *Duranta mandonii*) to severe pollen limitation (e.g. *Anigozanthos manglesii*, *Canarina canariensis*).
2. **Network-level change rarely collapses architecture but reshapes roles.** Invaders inflate selectiveness and re-occupy core positions that mirror their native-range roles (role conservatism), with weighted metrics outperforming binary ones for forecasting competitive impacts.
3. **Predators and social insects impose powerful **indirect** effects.** Black rats, Argentine ants and western yellow-jacket wasps depress pollinator abundance and floral visitation by up to 95 %, often dwarfing direct competition effects.
4. **Gene-flow consequences are double-edged.** Africanised honeybees extend mean pollen dispersal from ~200 m to >1.5 km and can triple seed production (“genetic rescue”) but simultaneously raise selfing (≈10 → 14 %).  Beetle-pollinated trees show opposite patterns, highlighting guild-specific vulnerability.
5. **Facilitation–competition switches hinge on invader density and spatial configuration.** Low-density alien floral displays can temporarily boost native pollen receipt (“magnet” or Lonicera effect) before flipping to competition at higher density.
6. **Restoration works but must be multi-taxa.** Exotic shrub removal on tropical mountaintops, combined plant/arthropod control in Seychelles, and targeted suppression of rats, ants or wasps in Hawaii rebuild pollination within 1–3 years; partial actions leave bottlenecks.
7. **A technological pipeline is poised to transform vertebrate and invertebrate invader control in steep terrain:** RNAi and virus-vectored fertility agents, drone baiting, hydramethylnon gels, self-resetting traps and Bayesian detection models are at Technology Readiness Levels 6–8 and entering pilot deployments.

## 1 Scope and Objectives

Given the absence of region/taxon constraints in the dialogue, I synthesise patterns **across tropical mountain ranges globally** (Andes, Eastern Arc, New Guinea Highlands, Hawaiian & Macaronesian islands, Afro-montane fynbos, Seychelles, Cape Floristic Region, Caribbean cordilleras).  All major invasive **taxonomic classes** (flowering shrubs/trees, honeybees, bumblebees, wasps, ants, rodents) are covered from **three analytical angles**: mechanistic ecology, empirical case studies and management/mitigation.

## 3 Mechanistic Pathways and Empirical Evidence

### 3.1 Direct Floral Competition & Behavioural Shifts

**Honeybees (*Apis mellifera*)**
• Cameroon *Cosmos sulphureus*: 95.6 % of 1,128 visits by Apis; single visit raised fruiting 50 %.  
• Andean Sacred Valley (2 800–4 200 m): Apis universal core, exploits many plants but intensively forages on a subset; no displacement yet detected.  
• Pampas & NW Argentina: landscape disturbance → Apis dominance + 20 % seed drop in natives.  
• Scotland: smaller thorax widths in *Bombus* workers near apiaries → resource-mediated fitness costs despite long co-history.  

**Exotic *Bombus* spp.**  
• Chilean Andes invasion front: *Bombus terrestris* delivers ≤5 % of *Mimulus luteus* pollen; no immediate displacement of native *B. dahlbomii*.  
• Australian cytisus system: introduced *B. terrestris* marginally boosts λ of *Cytisus scoparius* yet plant occupancy remains microsite-limited.

**Functional substitution vs. mismatch**  
• Full substitution: Caribbean *Goetzea elegans* (Apis = native bird), Andean *Duranta mandonii* (Apis = *Bombus*).  
• Partial/poor substitution: Canary *Canarina*, W. Australian *Anigozanthos*, Hawaiian lobelioids (birds now nectar thieves, bees main pollinators).

**Density-mediated switches**  
• *Lonicera maackii*: at ≈8 inflorescences m⁻² visitation to *Geranium maculatum* +45 %; at ≈80 inflorescences m⁻² visit duration –30 %, no seed benefit.  
• ‘Magnet’ factorial: facilitation at low density/regular spacing, competition when magnet density rises.

### 3.2 Alteration of Pollen Dispersal, Mating Systems & Genetics

• *Dinizia excelsa* pasture fragments: Africanised Apis expands mean pollen flow 212 → 1 509 m, single 3.2 km flight; seed set triples, selfing 10 → 14 %.  
• *Eucalyptus gracilis*: high multiple paternity & near-complete outcrossing corroborate ‘constrained-inbreeding’ → sire diversity vs. F matters.  
• Landscape-scale paternity: small bees still deliver 49 % of >1 km events; local kinship depresses seed set.  
• Bornean dipterocarps: beetle-pollinated species exhibit strong fine-scale SGS; fragmentation raises inbreeding risk disproportionately for low-mobility pollination guilds.

### 3.3 Network-Level Architecture

• 48 networks: invaders retain native-range centrality (role conservatism).  
• 56 % alien links on Galápagos islands increase selectiveness modestly; nestedness/module structure resilient.  
• Weight‐preserving projections necessary: ignoring weights scrambles degree centrality while betweenness stays stable.  
• Hierarchical detection models add 13 % connectance; 46 % singleton interactions highlight sampling bias.

### 3.4 Indirect Effects from Predators, Ants & Wasps

• **Rats**  
  – Canary *Canarina*: rats remove 10 % flowers → fruit set one-third.  
  – Hawaiian dry forest: suppressing rats, mice, ants, wasps → insect visitation +90 %.  
  – Macquarie & New Caledonia: raceme/egg predation >40 – 90 % by rats.  
• **Argentine & Big-headed ants**  
  – Cape fynbos: pine/eucalypt invasion → Argentine ant surge, loss of myrmecochory; removal prerequisite to ant control.  
  – Cousine Island: hydramethylnon bait stations cut *Pheidole megacephala* 93 %, scale insects 100 %, foliage recovery in *Pisonia*.  
• **Western yellow-jacket**  
  – Hawaiian montane wet forest: fipronil + heptyl-butyrate bait ↓ wasps 95 %, doubled *Metrosideros* fruit set.  

### 3.5 Plant Demography & Population Models

• Network–demography link rare; *Cytisus* lattice model shows small λ effect of invader pollinator relative to microsite limitation.  
• IPMs outperform matrix models, allow continuous traits and density-dependence—critical for data-poor montane plants.  
• Transient dynamics (post-disturbance amplification) predict plant invasiveness better than λ; potential phytosanitary application.

## 4 Regional Case Studies

### 4.1 Tropical Andes (2 800–4 200 m)

• Nine Sacred-Valley valleys: Apis core generalist; 85 % interactions valley-specific → high beta-diversity, spatial management must be valley-tailored.  
• *Duranta mandonii*: Apis = *Bombus* in effectiveness, hummingbirds ineffective → large-bee functional group controls reproduction.  
• *Mimulus/Bombus* front: invader *B. terrestris* still minor, competitive displacement not yet evident.

### 4.2 Hawaiian Highlands

• Oʻahu lobelioids: bees contact reproductive parts in 90.5 % visits vs. birds 0.7 %; canopy cover ↑ bird theft, flower number ↑ both taxa.  
• 3-year multi-predator control: 16 of 19 plant–pollinator interactions improved; model predicts >90 % gains with rat + ant removal.  
• Yellow-jacket suppression restored *Metrosideros* pollination; ant/rodent/wasp hierarchy can guide phased eradication.

### 4.3 Seychelles & Mascarenes Montane Islands

• Mahé 5-year invasive plant removal: pollinator visitation rebound yet invasive ants still depress flying pollinators → dual action essential.  
• Cousine Island ant–scale mutualism collapse triggered rapid *Pisonia* recovery without full eradication—suppression suffices for some processes.

### 4.4 Macaronesia (Canary Islands, Madeira)

• *Canarina canariensis*: dual bottleneck—rats (flower loss) + honeybees (nectar depletion, poor pollination).  
• Selective exclosure shows birds triple fruit set; apiculture expansion could exacerbate mismatch.

### 4.5 Afro-Montane Cape & Eastern Arc

• Cape suburban nectar feeders draw nectarivorous birds into gardens, depress sunbird visits ≤300 m into fynbos, 16 % drop in *Erica* pollination.  
• Exotic tree stands → Argentine ant proliferation → loss of ant seed-dispersal for ≥1 300 species.  
• Eastern Arc data lacking; extrapolation suggests similar ant-mediated disruptions where tea/coffee agroforest borders invade.

## 5 Synthesis of Facilitation–Competition Thresholds

| Invader context | Facilitation phase | Threshold | Competition phase |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Magnet experiment | Low density, regular spacing | Density × spatial CV | Pollinator sharing drops, seed set native ↓ |
| *Lonicera maackii* | 8 inflor. m⁻²      | ≈40 – 80 inflor. m⁻² | Visit duration native –30 %, no seed gain |
| Honeybee hive density | 1 colony ha⁻¹     | ≥10 colonies ha⁻¹ (flower‐poor landscape) | Long-tongued *Bombus* switch plants |

Guidance: quantify invader floral density and spatial variance before committing to blanket eradication; low-density buffers may transiently aid natives.

## 6 Management & Mitigation Toolkit for Mountainous Terrain

### 6.1 Plant‐Community Restoration

• **Alien shrub removal** on tropical mountaintops increased pollinator richness, interaction diversity and fruit set within 1 y; acts fastest when near pollinator source areas.  
• Retaining small ‘magnet’ densities can mitigate short-term pollinator shortfall post-clearance.

### 6.2 Vertebrate Invader Control

• **Conventional rodenticides:** Brodifacoum aerial broadcasts succeed 96.5 % temperate vs. 89 % wet tropics; rainfall, 24/7 breeding and land crab bait competition drive failures.  Desecheo monitoring showed >75 % pellets wasted on non-targets.  
• **Next-gen tools (TRL 6–8):** Rattus-specific RNA-interference baits, virus-vectored immunocontraception, ‘Trojan-Y’ gene drives; drones & self-resetting stations overcome access issues in steep terrain.  EFSA and international ERA frameworks provide hazard-exposure templates; Bayesian networks now applied to Farallon Islands planning.  
• **Fertility baits:** ContraPest® cut roof-rat activity 94 % on US poultry farm; pilot tests for cloud-forest reserves plausible.

### 6.3 Social Insect Suppression

• Hydramethylnon + pyriproxyfen sucrose gels deliver 85–100 % worker kill in Argentine ants; tree-trunk micro-encapsulated paint (chlorpyrifos + pyriproxyfen) keeps ants out of canopies an entire season.  
• Fipronil + heptyl-butyrate lures reduce yellow-jacket 95 % within 3 mo; sub-lethal fipronil collapses leaf-cutter colonies via behavioural impairment rather than forager kill → stealth suppression.

### 6.4 Honeybee/Bumblebee Density Management

• Reducing apiary density or relocating hives during native peak flowering can relieve resource pressure; Scottish thorax-width study evidences chronic stress even in historical co-occurrence zones.

### 6.5 Decision-Support Modelling

• Early-warning indicators: ≥60 % alien–native diet overlap, aliens visit >35 % plants, high plant generalist connectivity (≥0.25), specialist pollinators >30 % → severe native declines predicted in 31-variable simulation.  
• IPMs allow integration of pollination-driven fecundity changes, dormant stages and micro-site limitation; transferable to montane endemics.

## 7 Outstanding Knowledge Gaps

1. Causal links from **network rewiring → plant λ** remain scarce outside a few *Cytisus*, *Lasthenia*, *Banksia* systems.  Experimental pairing of pollination manipulations with IPM-oriented demographic tracking is critical.
2. **Trait-matched effectiveness** data for most native vs. alien pollinators above 2 500 m are missing; 3-D high-speed videography and pollen deposition assays could fill this.
3. **Adaptive behaviour of native pollinators** (temporal niche shifts, diet breadth plasticity) under sustained invader pressure is rarely quantified beyond “silent competition” observations in French Guiana/Panamá.
4. **Gene-drive ERA** specifically for vertically complex cloud-forest islands needs refinement (exposure pathways to nectarivorous birds, bats).

---

## 8 Recommendations

1. **Adopt a multi-taxa eradication sequence** in island and sky-island systems: rats → ants → wasps, monitored via Bayesian detectability models; partial control often fails to restore pollination.  
2. **Use plant density thresholds** to guide invasive shrub management, avoiding over-clearing when native floral resources are seasonally scarce.  
3. **Implement adaptive apiary zoning**—a ≤1 colony ha⁻¹ guideline in flower-poor montane landscapes, elevated only where empirical data show negligible native displacement.  
4. **Prioritise beetle-pollinated and bird-specialist plants** for genetic monitoring; low-mobility pollination guilds shown to accrue SGS and inbreeding fastest under fragmentation.  
5. **Embed IPM frameworks** in restoration to project long-term population responses and transient amplification risks; link with weighted network metrics rather than binary.  
6. **Invest in next-generation rodent/ant control pilots**; steep, inaccessible montane terrain stands to benefit most from drone baiting and self-resetting devices.

## 9 Concluding Perspective

Tropical mountain pollination networks are resilient in architecture yet fragile in function.  Invaders rarely shatter nestedness or modularity, but they degrade the **quality** of flows—pollen grains, genetic diversity, pollinator fitness—through a tapestry of direct and indirect pathways.  The emerging picture is not uniformly grim: alien honeybees can rescue gene flow for sparsely distributed trees; low-density shrubs can momentarily magnetise pollinators.  However, the weight of evidence shows that **net** effects trend negative once invader densities surpass system-specific thresholds, especially when predators, ants or wasps simultaneously act.

By combining network science, demographic modelling and a suite of innovative eradication technologies, conservation practitioners can now forecast, detect and reverse many of these disruptions.  The challenge—and opportunity—lies in deploying these tools rapidly, before functional erosion crosses points of no return in the world’s cloud forests, páramos and montane archipelagos.
