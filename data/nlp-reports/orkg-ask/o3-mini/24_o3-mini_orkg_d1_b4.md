## Executive Summary

This report provides an extensive analysis of the *InsideOut* research project focusing on debiased emotional dialogue generation through the use of a multi-agent system. The primary usability of debiasing techniques in emotionally charged dialogue is examined, emphasizing both social bias and emotional exaggeration dimensions. Through the integration of advanced natural language processing (NLP), affective computing, and multi-modality, the project sets a new standard in developing empathetically aware dialogue systems. We explore how multi-agent architectures—whether collaborative, competitive, or hybrid—can be employed to represent and generate more reliable emotional interactions while addressing bias. We also review state-of-the-art mitigation and evaluation strategies, incorporating recent research outcomes such as perspective-taking, fusion-based emotion recognition, dynamic appraisal models, and social contact debiasing techniques.

## Introduction

The development of emotionally intelligent dialogue systems has undergone a transformative change over recent years. The *InsideOut* project is positioned at the intersection of affective computing and dialogue generation, aiming to reduce biases while increasing realism in emotional interactions. Specifically, the work targets debiasing mechanisms to handle both algorithmic social biases and those emerging from exaggerated emotional responses. The integration of a multi-agent system is used not only for enhanced interactive capabilities but also to diversify the modality of dialogue generation, simulating realistic human conversations across cooperative and competitive settings.

This report systematically outlines the key elements of the research, starting with an analysis of what constitutes 'debiased' interaction in dialogue systems, exploring the role of the multi-agent framework, and finally addressing evaluation metrics and datasets relevant to debiasing efforts.

## Defining Bias and Debiasing in Emotional Dialogue Generation

### 3.1 Types of Bias in Emotional Dialogue

In the context of emotional dialogue generation, the notion of 'debiased' refers to mitigating multiple forms of bias:

- **Social Biases:** These include prejudices related to gender, race, age, and other socio-demographic attributes that can inadvertently influence the generated dialogue. Systematic debiasing in this respect aims to correct or neutralize such influences in the emotional content produced by dialogue systems.

- **Emotional Exaggeration:** Addressing tendencies where dialogue systems overstate or misinterpret emotional cues. For example, overly dramatic responses can lead to perceptions of inauthenticity. Using affect-aware models that incorporate perspective-taking and context-sensitive pragmatic cues helps mitigate these issues.

- **Algorithmic and Measurement Biases:** These biases may arise from skewed training datasets or limited emotional annotations. Techniques such as multi-modal data integration and fine-tuned evaluation protocols have been explored to counter these tendencies.

### 3.2 Strategies for Bias Mitigation

Recent research indicates promising strategies for debiasing in emotional dialogue systems include:

- Incorporation of perspective-taking cues and pragmatic information to ascertain the causes of emotions. This allows the system to generate responses that are calibrated without exaggeration.

- Fusion-based techniques that integrate prosodic, acoustic, and lexical signals along with dialogue act information. Dual-fusion modules and DIS-NV functions can specifically help in reducing uncertainty-related bias in emotional dimensions.

- Social Contact Debiasing (SCD) approaches which simulate social interactions using large-scale datasets (e.g., 108k simulated prompts) have shown up to a 40% bias reduction in initial epochs, highlighting an effective mitigation path.

## Multi-Agent System Architecture and Dynamics

The utilization of a multi-agent system within the *InsideOut* framework is pivotal in both emulating complex social interactions and managing bias in large-scale dialogue generation.

### 4.1 Collaborative vs. Competitive Dynamics

- **Collaborative Dynamics:** Here, agents share information and strategies to produce emotionally coherent responses. This collaboration can allow for shared perspective-taking, balancing multiple interpretations of a dialogue and fostering nuanced empathy. For instance, virtual museum guides that collectively simulate visitor interactions can tailor responses based on aggregated emotional data.

- **Competitive Dynamics:** In scenarios like gaming or debates, competitive interactions promote diverse emotional expressions that challenge and thereby calibrate the emotional tone of the dialogue. Such setups can also expose latent biases, providing a fertile ground for testing debiasing techniques in real-time.

- **Hybrid Approaches:** Recent models have started integrating both dynamics, where agents may cooperate in certain sub-tasks (e.g., establishing trust) while remaining competitive in others (e.g., argumentation on subjective topics). This duality is particularly effective in simulating realistic human group decision-making, as observed in projects like ABS4GD.

### 4.2 Agent Communication Protocols

Effective communication between agents is facilitated by extendable agent languages that incorporate affective attitudes. Protocols often extend beyond simple message-passing to include:

- **Appraisal Framework Details:** Where agents use context, social norms, and personality filters to modulate their emotional responses.

- **Dynamic Interactions:** Using both direct self-reported emotions and indirect cues (psychophysiological signals) for more accurate real-time feedback.

- **Multi-modal Communication:** Incorporating real-time speech recognition and MIDI-based emotion expression systems, enhancing the temporal dynamics of response generation.

## Research Learnings: Integrative Approaches for Debiased Emotional Dialogue

This section consolidates several key learning facets from previous research that have informed the development of debiasing techniques within emotional dialogue generation.

### 5.1 Perspective-Taking and Pragmatic Cues

Recent work (e.g., 2021 ACL studies) has shown that leveraging pragmatic cues and perspective-taking techniques can identify the cause of emotions within dialogue. By isolating emotion cause words without the need for fine-grained sub-utterance annotations, systems can generate responses that are contextually accurate and free from exaggerated emotional content.

### 5.2 Fusion-Based Emotion Recognition

Advanced fusion-based models incorporate multiple classifiers that process prosodic, acoustic, and lexical cues. The dual-fusion module approach, in particular, has improved emotion recognition accuracy by an absolute 2.25%. This method involves:

- Combining traditional lexical analysis with prosodic features gleaned from acoustic signals.
- Using dialogue act information as a supplementary channel for detecting emotional uncertainty.

This multi-faceted approach is instrumental in debiasing by ensuring a balanced measurement of emotional intensity and enabling dynamic adaptation of responses.

### 5.3 Modeling Primary and Secondary Emotions

The integration of detailed emotion modules, as in systems like the conversational agent Max, has demonstrated the value of modeling both primary and secondary emotions. By differentiating between these levels of emotional resolution, dialogue systems can deliver more nuanced and believable interactions. Such modeling often involves:

- Cognitive frameworks that separate base emotions (e.g., anger, joy) from more blended or context-dependent states (e.g., frustration, bittersweet feelings).
- Dynamic updates based on real-time user interactions which are critical for inner emotional regulation.

### 5.4 Social Contact Debiasing (SCD)

A novel method, Social Contact Debiasing, applies directly to large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA 2 and Tulu. By leveraging vast simulated interaction datasets (comprising up to 108,000 prompts), early experiments have shown significant reductions—up to 40% with minimal training epochs—in social biases. This approach underscores the potential effectiveness of simulated social contexts as a debiasing mechanism.

## Evaluation Frameworks and Datasets

Evaluation is a critical component in establishing the effectiveness of debiasing strategies in emotional dialogue systems. The evaluation frameworks in use span both objective and subjective measures.

- **Objective Metrics:** These include task success rates and computational measures like adequacy and fluency. Notably, improvements up to 12.8% have been observed in human correlation metrics when detailed affective analysis is incorporated.

- **Subjective Assessments:** User satisfaction surveys and psychophysiological measurements (e.g., heart rate variability, skin conductance) are becoming integral in evaluating real-world performance. Such data not only verify the emotional authenticity of the responses but also track user well-being during interactions.

- **Datasets:** Systems such as MEI-DG utilize large-scale multi-modal datasets (a 34k conversation MEIMD dataset from TV series and other contexts) which ensure diversity in emotional expression and serve as robust training grounds for state-of-the-art debiasing techniques. Additionally, simulated datasets used in Social Contact Debiasing extend the applicability and scope of bias evaluation.

## Integration of Multi-Modal Technologies

Enhancing emotional authenticity requires the seamless integration of multiple modalities:

- **Real-Time Speech Recognition:** This ensures that dialogue systems can dynamically capture and respond to the spoken cues of users.

- **MIDI-based Emotion Expression:** Systems have incorporated hundreds of hours of MIDI format music to simulate emotional tone, providing dynamically adjusted acoustic overlays that mirror the intended emotional state.

- **Dynamic Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Visual Cues:** Employing approximately 70 facial expressions to effectively simulate emotion, as seen in frameworks such as MEI-DG, further enhances the realism of responses.

This convergence of technologies not only supports the debiasing efforts by allowing multiple data points for emotional calibration, but also enriches overall user engagement with the system.

## Emerging Trends and Future Directions

While significant progress has been made in debiased emotional dialogue generation, several emerging trends and future avenues warrant exploration:

1. **Personalized Emotion Modeling:** Advanced AI systems could integrate personalized emotional profiles, capturing unique emotional triggers and responses for individual users. This personalization can further reduce inadvertent biases while enhancing relatability.

2. **Hybrid Communication Models:** Development of novel agent-to-agent communication protocols that allow simultaneous cooperative-competitive interactions will be crucial in achieving robust emotional and social dialogue systems.

3. **Integration with Neuro-Symbolic AI:** Combining symbolic reasoning with deep learning models may offer new ways to interpret affective signals beyond surface-level cues, potentially leading to finer debiasing strategies.

4. **Cross-Cultural Emotional Intelligence:** Given differences in emotional expression across cultures, future work could include culturally adaptive models that learn context-specific debiasing rules.

5. **Real-Time Adaptive Learning:** Employing reinforcement learning paradigms where systems adapt their debiasing strategies based on immediate user feedback and psychophysiological responses could result in more dynamic and resilient dialogue systems.

6. **Advanced Multi-Agent Simulations:** Leveraging high-fidelity simulations and game-theoretic approaches may result in deeper insights into emergent biases and improve collaborative conflict resolution strategies within multi-agent settings.
