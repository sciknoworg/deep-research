## 1. Introduction

Industrial Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) documents are among the most complex forms of technical documentation, synthesizing stakeholder intents, legal mandates, technical constraints, and domain-specific knowledge. The inherent verbosity, diversity of language and structure, and the evolving nature of these documents create significant challenges for automated analysis. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in handling natural language processing tasks but are constrained by their narrow context window. This report explores state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies to overcome these limitations within the context of industrial SRS analysis. Building on a comprehensive review of existing tools, frameworks, and research approaches, we outline potential solutions that integrate hierarchical processing, chunking, retrieval-based methods, and novel hybrid approaches.

## 2. Problem Statement and Scope

### 2.1. The Narrow Context Window Challenge

LLMs such as GPT and others typically operate with a fixed token window that may not suffice when parsing lengthy SRS documents. This narrow context window limits the model’s capacity to capture long-distance dependencies, holistic document structure, and complex interdependencies among requirements. Consequently, tasks such as detecting redundancies, ensuring traceability, and identifying inconsistencies in large industrial SRS become challenging.

### 2.2. Domain Specificity in Industrial SRS Documents

Industrial SRS documents, unlike generic texts, codify multifaceted requirements that include:

- **Stakeholder Business Intents:** Incorporating strategic business goals and user expectations.
- **Legal Mandates:** Reflecting industry-specific regulatory frameworks and compliance issues (e.g., in finance, education).
- **Technical Constraints:** Capturing technical specifications, integration points, and legacy system details.

Such factors necessitate approaches that are not only robust against context limitations but also adaptive to domain-specific language and structure.

## 3. Review of Existing Methodologies

### 3.1. End-to-End Formalization Frameworks

Systems like ReForm, developed by UTRC Ireland, have pioneered the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to transform natural language requirements directly into auto-generated monitoring scripts in MATLAB/Simulink. These frameworks streamline both legacy and new requirements processing by formalizing the requirements end-to-end. The success of ReForm underlines the potential of integrating end-to-end formalization with modules designed to tackle context window issues.

### 3.2. Hierarchical Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)

A significant learning comes from the four-step hierarchical SRL strategy, which groups linguistic roles by properties (e.g., Core versus Adjunct) to ensure computational efficiency and high accuracy. By partitioning language into hierarchical tiers, this approach can dovetail with LLMs to generate nuanced interpretations of requirements, maintaining fidelity even when documents exceed the typical context limit.

### 3.3. Hybrid Summarization with CLSA and LSTM Networks

The merging of Cross Latent Semantic Analysis (CLSA) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models has demonstrated improved performance in summarization tasks. In empirical studies, this hybrid mechanism boosted precision from 79.1% to 93.6%. This evidences that integrating statistical summarization with sequence modeling techniques can effectively condense lengthy SRS texts, providing enriched summaries that assist in subsequent analysis phases.

### 3.4. Retrieval-Based and Ranking-Enhanced Methods

The RRescue approach utilizes a ranking-based method with partial orderings to enhance LLM reasoning over extended contexts. By employing response ranking metrics, integrating heuristic and human feedback, and validating on multi-document benchmarks (arXiv:2311.09136), this method ensures that salient information is effectively prioritized even when faced with the narrow context window constraint.

## 4. Techniques to Mitigate the Narrow Context Window

Based on the review of research and current techniques, several promising methods emerge:

### 4.1. Document Chunking and Hierarchical Integration

**Approach:** Break down SRS documents into manageable chunks (e.g., section-wise, paragraph-level), with each chunk processed individually by the LLM. In a subsequent hierarchical integration phase, outputs are reassembled to generate a comprehensive analysis.

**Benefits:**

- Reduces the risk of overlooking critical details spread across long documents.
- Allows localized, high-resolution processing which, when combined with hierarchical semantic integration, preserves overall document meaning.

**Integration:** Leverage hierarchical SRL to structure the sub-chunks and re-integrate with high-level document summaries to maintain context.

### 4.2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Approach:** Integrate external memory and retrieval-based systems that can reference entire documents outside the immediate context window. Techniques such as indexing key excerpts and linking them with query-specific contexts can mitigate context limitations.

**Benefits:**

- Empowers LLMs to fetch relevant passages dynamically, supplementing its narrow window with external context.
- Enables refined query-portions to be matched against regulatory and technical lexicons established through domain-specific training data.

**Implementation:** Utilize graph-based approaches (e.g., NEO4J) and clustering techniques like k-means for efficient retrieval of interconnected requirements spanning the document.

### 4.3. Hybrid Pipeline Integration with ML Classifiers

**Approach:** Employ advanced NLP pipelines combined with ML classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes, LS-SVM) to pre-process and classify requirements across heterogeneous documents. This multi-stage pipeline decompresses the document into structured, categorized segments that can be individually processed by an LLM.

**Benefits:**

- Achieves high precision (up to 0.86) and recall (0.95), allowing for a more accurate extraction of domain-specific content.
- Enhances traceability, redundancy detection, and inconsistency identification when incorporated with domain-specific extraction techniques.

**Learning Integration:** The success of LC-HRMS and LS-SVM classifiers underscores the benefit of embedding these advanced algorithms within the LLM pipeline, in tandem with hierarchical and retrieval-based systems.

### 4.4. Dependency Analysis and Logic Form Inference

**Approach:** Combine dependency parsing frameworks (e.g., MINIPAR) and statistical dependency analyses with traditional retrieval systems to capture logical relationships in requirements.

**Benefits:**

- Fosters a dual approach, utilizing both statistical and rule-based methods to infer logic forms and dependency trees. This approach is especially effective in identifying complex interdependencies among requirements.
- Aids in accurately handling the language intricacies and domain-specific syntax present in industrial SRS documents.

### 4.5. Incorporating Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning

**Approach:** Tailor LLMs using domain-specific corpora and integrate expert feedback loops to refine model performance. Approaches such as scope detection using weak supervision in tandem with BERT domain embeddings play a vital role in mitigating context truncation.

**Benefits:**

- Fine-tuning LLMs with domain-specific data increases robustness and ensures that nuance is preserved even when dealing with abridged chunks.
- Supports evolving requirements by allowing for continuous updates as new legal and technical mandates emerge.

## 5. Practical Considerations and Novel Techniques

### 5.1. Interdisciplinary System Integration

A holistic requirements analysis system should simultaneously integrate hierarchical processing, retrieval augmentation, clustering, and logic form inference. This multi-faceted approach would ensure that the narrow context window limitation does not compromise the analysis by providing layers of fallback computation. For instance, a pre-processing phase leveraging shallow ML classifiers could feed into a deep hierarchical summarizer that utilizes both CLSA/LSTM hybrids and ranking-based retrieval.

### 5.2. Regulatory and Compliance Dimensions

Given the importance of legal and regulatory compliance, especially in industries like finance and education, it is essential to incorporate legal text analysis alongside standard requirement extraction. Frameworks such as 'Towards a Framework for Law-Compliant Software Requirements' indicate that incorporating regulatory dimensions early in the analysis pipeline helps shape the extraction parameters, ensuring that the processed output is not only technically sound but also compliant with relevant laws.

### 5.3. Future Directions and Speculative Approaches

#### Graph Neural Networks (GNN) Integration

Speculatively, integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent and analyze the relationships between various requirements can be a novel way to overcome the context-window limitation. GNNs can process representations built from requirements interdependencies, which are then fed into LLMs enhanced with retrieval-augmented frameworks.

#### Adaptive Context Windows

Future LLM designs may incorporate adaptive context windows—dynamic allocation of tokens based on the document’s semantic density. Although still in early research stages, preliminary models show that adaptive token allocation could significantly reduce context loss in complex documents.

#### Cross-Modal Integration

Another speculative idea is to combine text with other forms of data (such as diagrams, flowcharts, or even code snippets) using multi-modal learning. Ensuring that LLMs can leverage visual as well as textual data might particularly benefit industrial SRS analysis, where diagrams and specification charts provide essential context.

## 6. Conclusions and Recommendations

The narrow context window of conventional LLMs represents a considerable challenge in the analysis of industrial SRS documents. Despite inherent limitations, current techniques based on document chunking, retrieval augmentation, hierarchical semantic processing, and structured dependency analysis provide a robust foundation for overcoming these limitations.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Modular and Hierarchical Techniques:** Breaking documents into manageable units and subsequently integrating them hierarchically (using advanced SRL and hybrid summarization methods) is critical.
2. **Retrieval-Aided Approaches:** Techniques that incorporate external memory and document retrieval (e.g., RRescue’s ranking methodology) enhance the overall model’s capacity to maintain context over long documents.
3. **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning:** Customizing LLMs with domain-specific corpora, along with fine-tuned ML classifiers, ensures that nuanced aspects of legal, technical, and stakeholder requirements are adequately preserved and analyzed.
4. **Interdisciplinary Integration:** Leveraging both statistical and rule-based systems, combined with state-of-the-art graph-based and multi-modal data processing, offers a promising avenue for future research.

### Recommendations for Implementation:

- **Pilot Hybrid Systems:** Initiate pilot projects that integrate hierarchical chunking with retrieval-augmented generation to validate enhanced performance on real-world SRS documents.
- **Continuous Domain Updating:** Create feedback loops with domain experts and integrate automated updates to the model’s fine-tuning datasets, ensuring that evolving regulatory and technical requirements are promptly incorporated.
- **Invest in Research:** Further exploration of adaptive context windows, cross-modal integration, and graph neural networks should be prioritized as a long-term strategy.
- **User-Centric Approach:** Finally, ensure that the system provides clear traceability and justifications for all inclusion/exclusion decisions made during requirements extraction, thus maintaining transparency and accountability.
