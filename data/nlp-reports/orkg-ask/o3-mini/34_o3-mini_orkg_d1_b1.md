## Introduction

The study of negation-related errors within large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a significant challenge within natural language processing, particularly as these models scale and are deployed in low-resource as well as high-stakes environments. The notion of "prompt evolution" is presented as a progressive, iterative refinement of the input prompts to the LLMs, aiming to minimize errors associated with negation. This report consolidates extensive research learnings, spanning from prompt tuning advancements to fine-tuning loss functions and adapting computational models of historical language change via the SA-OT framework. The report is intended as a comprehensive exploration of prompt evolution methodologies, aimed at mitigating errors caused by complex linguistic phenomena such as negation.

## Background and Motivation

Negation in language is a subtle yet pervasive phenomenon, often leading to misinterpretations both in semantics and in model outputs. The errors related to handling negation are not only a deficiency in model performance but also a barrier to deploying these systems in critical applications where precise understanding of linguistically negative content is paramount. The motivation behind prompt evolution is twofold:

- **Empirical Accuracy:** Enhance the robustness of LLMs, particularly against nuanced linguistic constructs.
- **Theoretical Insight:** Explore the underlying architectural and training paradigms that could embed a more sensitive handling mechanism for negation.

Traditionally, research dealing with negation errors has pursued either fine-tuning approaches or pure architectural modifications. However, recent work suggests that refining the input prompts can lead to improvements that are complementary to other training modifications.

## Overview of Prompt Evolution

Prompt evolution refers to the iterative refinement process of the prompts that are presented to a language model. Rather than altering the model architecture itself, this approach focuses on the "front end" of how the model is queried. The evolution process typically involves:

- **Defining Baseline Prompts:** Starting with a generic prompt format.
- **Iterative Modifications:** Incorporating domain-specific nuances, particularly for negation handling.
- **Empirical Validation:** Conducting performance benchmarks and error analysis.
- **Feedback Loops:** Refining the prompts based on observed shortcomings such as misinterpreted cue words, partial negation, or syntactic discontinuities in negative constructions.

This method is particularly effective in low-resource contexts, as demonstrated in early works on prompt tuning (e.g., the DPT framework). The iterative process is central to keeping the prompts aligned with both the linguistic theory and the empirical performance data.

## Prompt Tuning and Discriminative PLMs

One of the pioneering works in prompt evolution is the application of discriminative pre-training tasks (DPT) within frameworks such as ELECTRA. The key insights include:

- **Reformulation as Discriminative Tasks:** Instead of relying solely on generative modeling, tasks are reframed as discriminative challenges that the prompt can effectively guide. This is essential in text classification and question answering tasks where negation plays a role.

- **Benefits in Low-Resource Settings:** The DPT framework has shown significant improvements in scenarios with limited labeled data, harnessing the potential of fine-tuning prompts to reduce negation-related interpretation errors.

- **Iterative Refinement:** Research highlights that by iteratively updating prompts to incorporate insights from error analysis, one can systematically improve the response behavior of models when handling negation.

A central takeaway is that discriminative prompt tuning not only boosts performance metrics but also illuminates the fundamental challenges posed by negation in natural language comprehension and generation tasks.

## Modifications to Loss Functions and Prompt Engineering Strategies

Advancements in prompt evolution have also been marked by targeted modifications in the underlying loss functions when fine-tuning LLMs. Key findings include:

- **Task-Specific Instruct Text:** Experiments with models such as BERT, huBERT, and ELMo have shown that incorporating task-specific instructions in the prompt can induce more robust handling of negation. A notable example is the Hungarian language model fine-tuning experiment where the HuWNLI dataset accuracy improved from 65% to 85%.

- **Loss Function Adaptations:** By modifying loss functions to emphasize correct interpretations of negation, researchers have been able to directly counteract common pitfalls in token-level predictions. This approach integrates the prompt engineering process with training dynamics, leading to more stable convergence during fine-tuning.

- **Iterative Prompt Reinforcement:** The approach of iteratively revising prompts reflects a dual path: adjusting both the prompt format and the computation linking model output to the loss function parameters. Such a dual strategy allows for sharper adjustments when dealing with linguistic complexities inherent in negation.

These modifications highlight the importance of not only crafting better prompts but also ensuring that the feedback provided during training reinforces the proper interpretation of negation, thereby reducing error propagation in model outputs.

## Application of SA-OT in Modeling Negation Evolution

A particularly innovative approach to understanding and mitigating negation errors comes from the application of the SA-OT (Simulated Annealing Optimality Theory) framework. This computational model has been used to simulate the evolution of sentential negation following Jespersen's Cycle, which categorizes the historical stages of negation into pre-verbal, discontinuous negative forms, and post-verbal stages. Key insights include:

- **Reproduction of Language Stages:** SA-OT has successfully modeled both pure and mixed language stages, offering a direct computational analogy to historical language change. This validation of the SA-OT model underscores its potential as a tool for promoting a deeper theoretical understanding of how negation evolves and how LLMs might learn to process it accurately.

- **Performance-Based Evaluation:** Unlike typical empirical benchmarks which solely focus on classification accuracy, SA-OT provides a framework where prompt evolution can be aligned with broader theories of linguistic transformation. This introduces an interesting perspective wherein the challenge of negation is not simply seen as an error mode, but as an opportunity to study language evolution through computational means.

- **Integration with Prompt Tuning:** Modeling the evolution of negation using SA-OT suggests that there is significant value in aligning prompt evolution strategies with theoretical models of language change. Iterative prompt modifications can be informed by insights from SA-OT, thereby allowing a harmonized approach that combines empirical prompt tuning with historical linguistic theory.

The integration of SA-OT into the study of negation errors provides a rare blend of linguistic theory and practical machine learning, ultimately broadening the paradigm in which prompt evolution strategies are conceptualized and implemented.

## Methodological Considerations: Empirical vs. Theoretical Approaches

In addressing negation-related errors, a central debate has emerged regarding the balance between empirical evaluation and theoretical exploration. The research can be divided into two intertwined streams:

1. **Empirical Evaluation:** Detailed performance benchmarks and error analysis are used to quantify improvements in model behavior as a function of iterative prompt evolution. This includes:
   - Benchmarking on datasets specifically designed to test negation handling (e.g., HuWNLI).
   - Fine-tuning experiments with varied prompt designs and loss function adjustments.
   - Comparative analysis across different model architectures (BERT, huBERT, ELECTRA, and ELMo).

2. **Theoretical Exploration:** There is a significant exploration into the theoretical underpinnings of why certain prompt modifications lead to improved handling of negation. This is achieved by:
   - Analyzing the linguistic implications of negation processing in generative vs. discriminative models.
   - Modeling historical language phenomena (using SA-OT) to understand diachronic changes in negation formulation.
   - Evaluating the role of syntactic and semantic cues in prompt design through a theoretical lens.

The integration of these two approaches is vital, as purely empirical improvements might miss underlying linguistic phenomena that drive errors, whereas theoretical models may lack immediate empirical validation. A dual pathway that acknowledges both perspectives offers a robust scaffold for designing next-generation prompt evolution methods.

## Challenges and Future Directions

While significant progress has been made, several challenges persist that offer numerous avenues for future research:

- **Scalability and Generalizability:** How can prompt evolution strategies be scaled to handle numerous languages and dialects, especially given the unique challenges posed by multilingual negation?

- **Automated Prompt Evolution:** Developing automated systems for iterative prompt refinement, possibly integrating reinforcement learning or meta-learning paradigms, could reduce reliance on manual error analysis.

- **Dynamic Loss Function Adjustment:** Further investigation is needed into how dynamic loss adjustments during training interact with prompt evolution. A more adaptive loss function could potentially cater to diverse linguistic phenomena beyond negation.

- **Interdisciplinary Integration:** Combining insights from historical linguistics (as achieved by the SA-OT framework) with modern machine learning techniques may yield novel architectures or training protocols that are inherently more robust for handling negation and other subtle language features.

- **Benchmark Development:** The creation of standardized benchmarks that focus explicitly on negation-related phenomena could offer a more systematic way of evaluating prompt evolution methodologies.

- **Contrarian Strategies:** Beyond iterative prompt tuning, alternative methods such as contrastive learning, adversarial examples tailored for negation, or even hybrid generative-discriminative frameworks merit exploration. These could provide alternative pathways for mitigating errors that current approaches might not fully address.

## Conclusion

In summary, prompt evolution for reducing negation-related errors in large language models represents a promising convergence of empirical techniques and theoretical insights. From leveraging discriminative prompt tuning frameworks like DPT, as applied in ELECTRA, to the nuanced modifications of loss functions in models like BERT and huBERT, each advancement contributes to a more robust understanding of negation processing.

Moreover, the innovative application of the SA-OT framework demonstrates that computational modeling of historical linguistic phenomena can enrich our approach to prompt design and iterative refinement. The multi-faceted strategy, which integrates empirical benchmarking with deep linguistic theory, underscores the dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of this research area.

Looking ahead, the integration of adaptive prompt tuning, dynamic loss functions, and automated prompt evolution holds promise for further reducing negation errors in LLMs. This evolving framework not only advances our technical capabilities but also deepens our understanding of the interplay between language evolution and machine learning.

This report has synthesized the key learnings and innovations from prior research, offering a roadmap for future explorations in prompt evolution and its application in mitigating negation-related errors in large language models.
