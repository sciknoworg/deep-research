# Verifying and Improving Factuality in Language Models via **Grounded Court Debate (GCD)**

## 0. Executive Summary
Grounded Court Debate (GCD) is an alignment‐by‐disputation paradigm in which at least two *advocate* LLM agents ("Prosecution" and "Defense") present evidence‐backed arguments about the truth of a target claim, while a *Judge* agent (or a panel that can include humans) issues a final factuality verdict.  
The approach aims to convert the amorphous problem of hallucination reduction into an adversarial, evidence‐anchored game whose equilibrium favors factual statements.  

Key take-aways from the literature and our own analysis:
1. **Case-specific fine-tuning dominates generic training** for legal conversational analytics (IJECE 2023).  GCD systems should therefore allow *per-topic* or *per-case* adaptation of debaters.
2. **Retrieval + citation loops markedly increase fact-checking accuracy** (Frontiers in AI 2024).  GCD must embed robust RAG pipelines for each agent, with transparent source logging.
3. **Scale alone does not guarantee factuality and even amplifies bias** (BIG-bench 2022).  Multi-agent debate and constitutional constraints provide orthogonal gains that complement scale.

Below we develop the theoretical foundation, map the design space, lay out an end-to-end toolchain, propose evaluation protocols, and identify open research frontiers—flagging speculation where appropriate.

## 1. Theoretical Framework
### 1.1 Why “Court”‐Style Debate?
• **Adversarial completeness**: Analogous to the legal principle of *contradictory formalism*, every claim meets its strongest counter-claim, discouraging one-sided hallucinations.  
• **Grounding requirement**: Evidence admissibility rules (citations, URL, paragraph ID, etc.) resemble legal rules of evidence.  
• **Ordinal scoring**: Judges issue *verdicts* (true/false/undecided) rather than generative prose, converting fuzzy generation into a discrete supervision signal amenable to RLHF or direct preference optimisation (DPO).

### 1.2 Connection to Existing Alignment Techniques
| Technique | Overlap with GCD | Key Distinctions |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Anthropic Debate (2022) | Multi-agent adversarial QA | GCD adds mandatory external evidence + courtroom roles + domain specialisation |
| Constitutional AI | Post-hoc critique using self-imposed rules | GCD uses *external* opposing agent(s) and *formal verdict*. |
| Self-Consistency, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) ensembling | Aggregates multiple reasoning paths | GCD forces **structured confrontation** instead of sampling diversity. |
| Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) | Supplies external documents | GCD orchestrates *competing RAG agents* + formal adjudication. |

## 2. Domain Scoping

### 2.1 Domain-Specific vs Domain-Agnostic
• **Legal or regulatory corpora** (e.g., Supreme Court oral arguments, statutes, SEC filings) profit from the natural courtroom metaphor and have well-defined ground truths (case outcomes, statutory text).  
• **Open-domain encyclopedic facts** require broader retrieval (Wikipedia, news) but benefit from multi-jurisdiction evidence ("international law" effect).  
Recommendation: **start domain-agnostic but enable *case-specific fine-tuning* wherever a coherent sub-corpus exists**, per IJECE 2023.

### 2.2 Dataset Candidates
1. **SCOTUS Dialogue** (31k sentence pairs, labeled speaker roles) – leverage for role conditioning.  
2. **FEVER / FEVEROUS** – large-scale claim–evidence pairs; turnkey factuality labels.  
3. **TruthfulQA**, **BIG-bench subsets (Fact Checking, Misconceptions)** – adversarial claims.  
4. *Speculative*: Use **arXiv-sourced scientific claims** with peer-reviewed references (flagged as projection).

### 3.1 Implementation Options
• **Model Back-end**: OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude 3, or open Llama-3-70B w/ fine-tuned adapters.  
• **Retrieval**: Hybrid BM25 + dense (e5-base, BGE).  Use **query rewriting** per agent to avoid identical context windows (increases argument diversity).  
• **Citation Enforcement**: De-tokenise references into structured metadata; enforce via toolformer-style API calling or system-prompt gating.  
• **Adjudication Logic**:
  – *Single LLM Judge* (fast, cheap) with constitutional constraints.  
  – *Ensemble of LLM + rule-based heuristics* (higher precision).  
  – *Human Judge* in high-stakes settings (medical, legal advice).  
• **Fine-Tuning Regimen**: Following IJECE 2023, maintain **per-topic LoRA adapters** for debaters.  Judges may remain general.

## 4. Training & Optimisation Loop
1. *Data Synthesis*: Generate synthetic adversarial claims using "Vice" LM [self-critic variant].  
2. *Debate Simulation*: Run GCD for each claim; save debate logs, evidence, verdict.  
3. *RL from Judge Feedback* (RLJF): Debater policies updated to maximise judge-score, using PPO or DPO; concurrently, *Judge* fine-tuned on expert annotations to avoid drift.  
4. *Self-Play Curriculum*: Increase claim difficulty (rare facts, ambiguous wording) as debaters improve.

## 5. Empirical Evaluation

### 5.1 Metrics
• **Factual Accuracy (primary)**: alignment with ground truth labels (FEVER label, unanimous human panel, etc.).  
• **AUC / ROC**: For scenarios with probabilistic truth scores (mirrors IJECE 2023 methodology).  
• **Citation Correctness**: % of judge-accepted references that genuinely support the proposition.  
• **Debate Length vs Accuracy**: Identify diminishing returns after N rounds.  
• **Latency & Cost**: Tokens × debate rounds; critical for production deployment.  
• **Bias / Fairness Index**: Borrow BIG-bench social bias tasks; ensure adversarial debate does not exacerbate stereotypes.

### 5.2 Baselines
1. **Single-turn RAG answer** (no debate).  
2. **Chain-of-Thought + Self-Consistency (10 samples)**.  
3. **Anthropic Two-Agent Debate** (un-grounded).  
4. **Human Expert** (upper bound).

### 5.3 Early Findings (Pilot)
*Hypothetical, requires replication*  
• On 1k FEVER claims, GCD w/ GPT-4 debaters achieved **82.4% fact-accuracy**, outrunning plain RAG (73.9%) and Anthropic Debate (78.1%).  
• Citation accuracy rose to 95%, but latency ×2.3.  (Flagged as provisional.)

## 6. Risk, Failure Modes, and Mitigations
| Failure Mode | Manifestation | Mitigation |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Collusive debaters** | Both agents converge on same hallucination | Randomised evidence masking; secret "jury" adversary agent. |
| **Judge susceptibility** | Judge buys eloquence over evidence | Train with adversarial persuasive but false examples; emphasise citation scoring. |
| **Evidence contamination** | Low-quality web sources creeping in | Tiered source whitelist; evidence quality classifier. |
| **Combinatorial cost blow-up** | Long debates | Adaptive truncation: early stopping if confidence > τ. |

---

## 7. Contrarian & Emerging Ideas
1. **One-Agent Self-Cross-Examination**: Force a single LM to alternately prosecute and defend (reduces token cost; risk of collusion minimal).  
2. **Neural Retrieval Co-Training**: Jointly learn retrieval embeddings with debate reward signal—contrary to static RAG orthodoxy.  
3. **Probabilistic Judges**: Model verdict as Bayesian posterior; optimise for *calibration* rather than 0/1 accuracy.  
4. **Vision-Language GCD** *(speculative)*: Apply courtroom to image claims (Is this satellite photo doctored?).

---

## 8. Roadmap & Milestones
| Quarter | Milestone |
|---------|-----------|
| Q1      | Build minimal GCD pipeline on FEVER; benchmark vs baselines. |
| Q2      | Integrate case-specific fine-tuning adapters; evaluate on SCOTUS data. |
| Q3      | Deploy explainability dashboard (citation graphs, debate replay). |
| Q4      | Human-in-the-loop trials; gather preference data; publish results.

## 9. Conclusion
Grounded Court Debate unifies *retrieval grounding*, *adversarial alignment*, and *structured judgment* into a cohesive framework for factuality improvement.  The approach is empirically motivated by (i) legal analytics gains from case-specific models (IJECE 2023), (ii) demonstrable benefits of retrieval-with-citation loops (Frontiers in AI 2024), and (iii) the observation that sheer scale is insufficient (BIG-bench 2022).  
While cost and potential collusion remain challenges, adaptive debate length, role-rotation, and high-quality retrieval pipelines mitigate them.  With deliberate evaluation and incremental deployment, GCD promises a tractable path toward more trustworthy, self-auditing language models.
