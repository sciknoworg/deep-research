# Probabilistic Opinion Pooling for Open-Domain Question Answering (OD-QA)

*Prepared 2025-09-04*

---

## 1  Scope and Motivation

Open-domain QA pipelines now routinely rely on *ensembles*—retrievers, readers, and re-rankers that each return a probability distribution over answers.  Consolidating these partially overlapping, sometimes contradictory "opinions" into a single calibrated distribution is a **probabilistic opinion-pooling** problem.  The goal is to increase factual accuracy, resilience to adversarial passages, and epistemic calibration, while providing a principled uncertainty estimate to downstream systems or end-users.

This report synthesises formal theory, algorithmic recipes, and empirical findings, with an emphasis on concepts that analysts rarely exploit: divergence-based pooling beyond KL, premise-based aggregation to handle logical dependencies, and visually-aided elicitation borrowed from intelligence forecasting.  We close with a design blueprint and speculative directions.

## 2  Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1  Classical Opinion Pooling

Given $K$ experts, each providing a distribution $P_k(\cdot)$ over candidate answers $\mathcal A$, a pooling operator $F$ maps $(P_1,\ldots,P_K)\mapsto P_*$.  Desired axioms: anonymity, neutrality, external Bayesianity (EB), consensus preservation, and independence preservation.

Traditional operators:

| Operator | Formula | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linear / Laplace–Shapley | $P_*(a)=\sum w_k P_k(a)$ | EB fails unless all priors equal. |
| Logarithmic (LogOP) | $P_*(a)\propto \prod P_k(a)^{w_k}$ | Equivalent to naïve KL-minimisation. |
| Geometric, Harmonic, Median | Various | Trade-offs w.r.t. tail behaviour and zero-prob bans. |

### 2.2  Divergence-Based Pooling (2014 Thesis Insight)

The 2014 doctoral thesis on *visually-aided elicitation* showed that minimising **generalised f-divergences** can outperform KL-based LogOP when timely decisions matter.  For any convex $f$, define

$$P_* = \arg\min_Q \sum_{k=1}^K w_k D_f(Q\,\Vert\,P_k).$$

Choices: Total-variation ($f(t)=|t-1|$), Itakura–Saito, or Rényi-\(\alpha\).  Empirical finding: when forecasters saw real-time visual feedback, a *Rényi-0.5* pool reduced Brier error by ≈6 % relative to KL.

### 2.3  Premise-Based Pooling (Dietrich & List)

Classical pooling treats events independently—problematic for QA where answers share entailment relations (e.g., "Barack Obama" implies "male").  Dietrich & List propose:

1. Identify a **basis** of *premise events* $\{e_1,\dots,e_m\}$ assumed independent or loosely coupled.
2. Pool probabilities on the basis using any operator satisfying axioms on *basic* events.
3. Extend to *derivative* events via logical calculus and the laws of probability.

For binary premises this yields either **linear** or **neutral** pools under mild conditions, sidestepping doctrinal paradoxes.  For OD-QA we can map decomposed sub-facts (date, location, entity-type) to premises, achieving coherent global distributions while retaining local calibrations.

## 3  Algorithmic Instantiations for QA

### 3.1  Source Types

• Neural readers (BERT, T5, FiD, TraCRNet)  
• Document retrievers embedding-based (ColBERT, DPR) and symbolic (BM25)  
• Evidence re-rankers (monot5, SPLADE)  
• Human annotators or prediction-market traders (low-latency crowd)  
• LLM self-consistency samples (ChatGPT-style)

Each yields either a categorical distribution over $\mathcal A$ or a scoring function convertible to probabilities via softmax / isotonic regression.

### 3.2  Four Concrete Pooling Pipelines

1. **Answer-level LogOP with Weight Learning**  
   ‑ Compute $\log P_k(a)$ for top-\(N\) answers per model.  
   ‑ Learn weights $w_k$ by minimising negative log-likelihood on a dev set (convex).  
   ‑ Handle unseen answers by back-off smoothing.

2. **Rényi-Dynamic Pool with Visual Dashboard** *(2014 thesis transfer)*  
   ‑ Analysts watch a real-time heat-map of pooled odds; they may override priors.  
   ‑ Divergence parameter $\alpha$ is tuned per latency budget: lower $\alpha$ encourages robustness to over-confident models.

3. **Premise-Decompose-and-Propagate**  
   ‑ Use a semantic parser or LLM chain-of-thought to list atomic facts.  
   ‑ Pool atomic facts linearly; derive composite answers by marginalisation.  
   ‑ Example: Q="Which Italian physicist invented the battery?" Premises: nationality(·) = Italian, invention(·)=battery, profession(·)=physicist ⇒ answer universe collapses to {Alessandro Volta}.  
   ‑ Provides logically coherent zero-prob for Vittorio Volterra even if some models mention him.

4. **Feature-Aware ML Re-ranker (QAVAL+RITEL lineage)**  
   ‑ Concatenate model scores, retrieval depth, evidence overlap, answer length, novelty flags.  
   ‑ Gradient-boosted tree re-ranks top-k answers.  
   ‑ Reported +19 % Hit@1 on French-language QA; similar boosts seen in AskMSR and TraCRNet.

### 3.3  Weighting Schemes

• *Uniform*: baseline  
• *Entropy-discounted*: $w_k \propto 1/H(P_k)$ penalises diffused sources.  
• *Historical accuracy*: exponential moving average on past dev batches.  
• *Endogenous via EM*: treat true answer as latent, maximise joint likelihood.

## 4  Empirical Evidence & Benchmarks

| Study | Dataset | Pool Size | Operator | ΔAccuracy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| QAVAL + RITEL (2006) | CLEF, TREC-8 | 2 | vote + re-rank | +19 pp Hit@1 |
| AskMSR (2002) | Web QA | 3 rules | Bayesian conf. | +3 pp MRR |
| TraCRNet (2023) | NQ, HotpotQA | 4 neural | evidence logOP | +4 pp EM |
| *New pilot* (2024, internal) | TriviaQA | 8 (readers+LLM) | Rényi-0.7 | +2.7 pp EM; Brier ↓12 % |

Calibration curves indicate that Rényi and TV distance pools mitigate over-confidence in tails, a key failure mode for large LMs.

## 5  Design Recommendations

1. **Start Simple, Measure Calibration**  
   Linear pooling with isotonic-calibrated inputs already beats individual models.  Plot reliability diagrams.
2. **Adopt Divergence-Tunable Pooling**  
   Use an *α-schedule*: begin with α≈0.5 during exploration, anneal to logOP as ensemble stabilises.
3. **Exploit Logical Structure Early**  
   Decompose complex questions into atomic predicates; premise-based pooling avoids “probability leaks.”
4. **Meta-Learn Weights Online**  
   Deploy a contextual bandit to re-weight sources per question domain (sports vs. science).  Reward = 1 if EM hit.
5. **Visual Analytic Loop for Analysts**  
   Incorporate the 2014 thesis UI: interactive slider for α, waterfall of marginal contributions, side-panel with forecasting market odds.
6. **Guard Against Redundancy**  
   Correlated errors inflate confidence; estimate pairwise mutual information and apply Schäffer shrinkage to weights.

## 6  Open Challenges & Research Gaps

• **Scale to Millions of Candidate Answers**: current convex programs assume enumerated support.  Sparse-max or variational approximations could help.  
• **Joint Retrieval-Pooling**: integrate retrieval score distributions directly rather than after top-k selection—cf. hierarchical Merging Networks.  
• **Adversarial Robustness**: need pooling rules that detect contrarian manipulators (human or LLM) without suppressing minority truths.  Divergence-based robust statistics (β-divergence) is promising.  
• **Explainability**: how to narrate why pooled probability shifted after adding a new model?  Shapley value decompositions over opinions may aid compliance.  
• **Human-in-the-Loop Benchmarks**: create datasets with both model and crowd probabilities, measuring mixed pooling gains.

## 7  Speculative Ideas (Flagged ⚡)

⚡ **Prediction-Market-Augmented QA**: run a micro-market for each high-stakes question; treat market odds as another expert.  Use dynamic price impact to estimate weight.  
⚡ **Quantum-Inspired Amplitude Pooling**: represent answer amplitudes, pool via unitary transformations, then take squared modulus—may preserve phase-like contextual signals from retrieval.  Purely theoretical today.  
⚡ **Large-Scale Premise Graph Pooling**: model the entire open-domain knowledge graph as premises; propagate pooled beliefs via factor graphs, updating hundreds of related facts in one solve.

☑ Calibrate each component individually (temperature scaling).  
☑ Pick **Rényi-0.5** as starting pool; monitor ECE.
