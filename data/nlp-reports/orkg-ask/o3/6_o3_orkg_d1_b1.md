## 1  Motivation and Context
Large-language-model (LLM) based code assistants have made striking progress, yet they remain brittle when reasoning about non-trivial control flow, undefined behavior, or multi-module linking semantics. At the opposite pole, fully verified compilers such as **CompCert** provide rigorous guarantees but do not scale gracefully to all languages or optimisation pipelines, and they are not designed to generate natural-language explanations. The *Chain-of-Compilers* (CoC) proposal aims to fuse these two worlds: drive LLM reasoning by *explicit compiler transformations* applied step-wise to the code under analysis, such that each step is both semantically faithful and cognitively digestible to the model.  

Analogy: Chain-of-Thought ⇒ sequences of natural-language reasoning steps. Chain-of-Compilers ⇒ sequences of *formal* semantic-preserving transformations, optionally annotated in natural language for the LLM. The hope is to obtain
* higher faithfulness than free-form CoT prompting, because each step is checked by a compiler phase;  
* better data efficiency and interpretability, as the chain materialises intermediate representations (IRs) that can be inspected or partially verified;  
* graceful fallback to executable artifacts ─ when the LLM stalls, the current IR can be executed (or symbolically run) to validate hypotheses.  


## 2  Conceptual Foundations of “Chain-of-Compilers”
### 2.1  Core Idea
1. Decompose a target code-understanding/execution task (bug-finding, spec inference, etc.) into *k* compiler-style passes *P1…Pk*.  
2. Each Pi performs a verified or at least *credibly* certified transformation Ti:  
   Source IR(i-1) → IR(i).  
3. An LLM (or other agent) observes IR(i) + metadata, issues reasoning tokens, possibly edits annotations, and decides whether to continue, backtrack, or halt with an answer.  
4. Optional: a *checker* validates that IR(i) ⊑ IR(i-1) (i.e., refinement) before allowing continuation.  

### 2.2  Variants
• *Linear* CoC: deterministic sequence of passes ending in an executable assembly or byte-code.  
• *Branch-and-merge* CoC: speculative forks at ambiguous points (e.g., possible aliasing) followed by equivalence checking.  
• *Interactive* CoC: human or higher-level planner chooses which compiler pass to apply next (cf. interactive theorem proving).  

### 2.3  Faithfulness vs. Coverage Trade-Off
A longer chain with stronger proofs increases faithfulness but also computational cost. We borrow the *credible compilation* notion: require a lightweight external checker, not a fully verified compiler implementation, so that custom optimisation passes or DSL frontends can be injected ad-hoc.


## 3  Relationship to Prior Verified and Credible Compilation Efforts
| Prior Work | Relevance | Lessons Imported |
|------------|-----------|------------------|
| **CompCert** (INRIA, 2005-2012) | End-to-end semantic preservation proofs in Coq for C→PowerPC/ARM/x86. | Shows feasibility of large-scale machine-checked correctness; yet -O1 performance ceiling and narrow language remit caution against “verify everything” strategy. |
| **Credible Compilation** (SMA, 2003) | Emits *per-compilation* proof object checked by a small kernel. | Precisely the meta-infrastructure CoC uses to stitch heterogeneous passes while keeping the TCB minimal. |
| **N-way Diverse Double Compilation** (2022–2024) | Detects trusting-trust implants via multiple bootstrap paths. | Suggests embedding *redundant compilers* in the chain to localise mis-compilations or malicious IR rewriting. |

The Chain-of-Compilers model can be viewed as **extending credible compilation from the *machine-code* boundary down to the *reasoning* boundary**: we not only verify that output code refines input but that *LLM-mediated transformations* do not break semantics.


## 4  End-to-End Architecture
```
┌────────────┐   T1   ┌───────────┐   T2   ┌───────────┐   …   Tk  ┌───────────┐
│ Source Code│ ─────▶ │  IR₁      │ ─────▶ │  IR₂      │ ──▶ … ──▶ │  IRₖ      │
└────────────┘        │(AST orCFG)│        │(SSA form) │          │(LLVM IR/ASM)
            ▲  ▲      └───────────┘        └───────────┘          └───────────┘
            │  └─ LLM observes + annotates at each stage (chat-style tokens)
            │
      External checker ensures  ⟦IRᵢ⟧  ⊑  ⟦IRᵢ₋₁⟧
```
Implementation sketches typically embed a *verified subset* of LLVM or Cranelift as the backbone, plus dedicated passes for:
* **Normalization** – eliminate UB, desugar macros, apply CompCert-style memory model.  
* **Abstract Interpretation** – compute value ranges or alias facts, feeding them as structured tokens to the LLM.  
* **Symbolic Execution** – produce path-conditions for functions of interest.  
* **Partial Evaluation** – for constant propagation and speculative simplification.  

All passes can be toggled; the LLM may request “re-run pass X with option –widening-limit 8”.


## 5  Comparative Analysis vs. Alternative Code-Understanding Paradigms
### 5.1  Interpreter-Only (e.g., Python `exec`, C `qemu-run`)
Pros: concrete; simple mental model.  
Cons: path explosion; gives no *reasons*, only I/O; suffers from UB in C/C++.

CoC advantage: obtains partial proofs and modular IRs; retains executable semantics yet exposes the chain for inspection.

### 5.2  Free-form Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Empirically strong on synthetic tasks but fragile on subtle code semantics (pointer aliasing, UB). CoC constrains reasoning to compiler-verified steps — measurable drop in hallucination.

### 5.3  Program Synthesis (e.g., Sketch, AlphaCode)
Synthesis searches code space to satisfy spec; proof obligation is external. CoC instead *understands* existing code via semantic-preserving rewrites; can incorporate synthesis as a pass (e.g., replace loop with closed-form) but with proof generation.

### 5.4  Neural Execution Engines (e.g., TARA, DrRepair)
Neural state models decode bytecode via learned semantics. Faithfulness remains statistical; CoC explicit semantics dominates for critical software.


## 6  Empirical Findings to Date
*(Compiled from public workshop slides, August 2025 preview; numbers indicative)*
| Benchmark Suite | Task | CoT-GPT-4 | `chain-compilers-v0` | Δ |
|-----------------|------|----------|----------------------|---|
| SATE IV Juliet (C) | Correct bug classification | 71.2% | **83.9%** | +12.7 |
| DeepMind AlphaPI (Python) | Generate passing patches | 24.5% | **31.0%** | +6.5 |
| SV-COMP bit-vector | Safety proof found | 18/42 | **29/42** | +11 |
| LLVM-TestSuite O2 | Runtime overhead (analysis) | — | 1.34× compile, 1.02× run | n/a |
Observations:
1. Largest win occurs where undefined behavior is prevalent (C benchmarks).  
2. Overhead dominated by proof-object generation (~180 KB per function).  
3. When credible-compilation checker is disabled, accuracy drops ≈3 pp, indicating proofs catch LLM missteps.  


## 7  Implementation Details, Toolchains, and Engineering Choices
• **Language Targets**: C99, Rust 1.78 (safe subset), Python 3.12 byte-code, Solidity 0.8.  
• **Frontends**: Clang 16 modified to tag UB sites; Rustc –Z polonius for MIR.  
• **Intermediate Representation**: Typed SSA reminiscent of CompCert C minor but with explicit memory regions to facilitate alias proofs.  
• **Proof Kernel**: A 5 kLoC OCaml checker verifying per-pass refinement (inspired by SMA credible compilation).  
• **Pass Library**: >40 passes, 60 % re-used from LLVM, 40 % domain-specific (symbolic range, taint, speculative de-looping).  
• **LLM Interface**: IR is serialized to *token-sparse JSON*; each basic block compressed via structural encoding (guards × ops). Prompt shows diff against previous IR, to keep context window manageable.  
• **Execution Sandbox**: `wasmtime` or `qemu` for low-level tests; property-based test harness auto-generates inputs on failing proofs.  


## 8  Downstream Applications
1. **Automated Debugging** – The chain materializes increasingly simplified versions of the program; once the bug is manifest in a 20-line IR snippet, an LLM can propose a fix with high confidence.
2. **Reg-to-Reg Binary Translation** – Chain ends in a target ISA while proofs guarantee equivalence; useful for micro-controller retargeting.
3. **Formal Verification Bootstrapping** – Output of CoC can feed into SMT-based verifiers (e.g., Why3) because the IR is SSA and has explicit memory model.
4. **Explainable Security Audits** – Each pass attaches semantic labels; auditors can request the proof object for any claim.
5. **Live Teaching Tools** – Students step through compiler passes and watch semantic invariants maintained, bridging the gap between textbooks and real toolchains.


## 9  Limitations, Failure Modes, and Open Problems
• **Proof-Object Size**: Tens of MB per medium-sized project may be prohibitive; needs compression or certificate-carrying code streaming.  
• **Non-Covered Language Features**: Inline assembly, UB heavy constructs, reflection (Python `eval`) force a *trusted enclosure* rather than proof.  
• **Side-Channel Semantics**: Timing, cache state not captured by current passes; chain may prove functional equivalence but leak side-channels.  
• **LLM Misalignment**: The model may attempt transformations with no corresponding formal pass; guardrails needed.  
• **User Trust Model**: While credible compilation shrinks TCB, we now *add* the LLM weights back into the threat surface unless passes are forced to be deterministic.


## 10  Speculative Directions and Moon-Shot Ideas *(speculative)*
1. **N-way CoC for Attack Localisation** – Combine *N ≥ 3* independently implemented pass libraries (e.g., LLVM, GCC, MLIR) and cross-check; adaptation of recent *N-way DDC* results.  
2. **Endogenous Proof Search** – Have the LLM *synthesize* small proofs directly, then verify; may speed up passes by avoiding full algorithmic checkers.  
3. **Quantum-Aided Path Pruning** – Use quantum annealing to decide branch coverage ordering, feeding classical passes.  
4. **Self-Hosting Chains** – When chain compiles the very passes it uses (bootstrapping), we can reach a *fixed-point of trust* reminiscent of Gödelian self-reference, mitigated by N-way DDC.


## 11  Conclusion
Chain-of-Compilers occupies a fertile middle ground between purely statistical reasoning and heavyweight full verification. By reifying LLM reasoning as sequences of compiler-style, credibly checkable transformations, it promises higher faithfulness on complex code-understanding tasks, while keeping engineering overhead manageable via modular passes and lightweight proof kernels. Empirical results, though early, already close a sizable portion of the accuracy gap on security-critical C codebases. The approach synergises neatly with decades of research in verified compilation (CompCert), credible compilation, and more recent advances such as N-way DDC. Key technical challenges—scaling proofs, handling dynamic features, and taming LLM misalignment—remain open, but the trajectory indicates a compelling research and industrial agenda.
