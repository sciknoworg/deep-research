## 1  Executive Summary
Large language models (LLMs) learn correlations between first names and latent demographic attributes (race, gender, socioeconomic status, religion, immigration status, etc.). These correlations can surface as *content bias* (stereotypical or toxic generations), *scoring bias* (lower probability for positive continuations), and *interaction bias* (users with certain names receive poorer answer quality).  

This report synthesises the most relevant academic findings to date—including the EDBT 2022 stereotype–detection work, the HOLISTICBIAS benchmark, and the AAAI 2024 socioeconomic bias corpus—and proposes a rigorous few-shot prompting mitigation framework that works with publicly-hosted LLM APIs (no weight access) yet can be combined with lightweight retrieval or fine-tuning when available.

Key take-aways:
* Use **name-swapped counterfactuals** and **intersectional evaluation** to detect subtle bias amplification, not just worst-case toxicity.
* A **3-phase prompt architecture**—(i) context sanitisation, (ii) debiased reasoning chain, (iii) name-redacted answer synthesis—systematically reduces first-name leakage.
* Few-shot exemplars should **explicitly instruct the model to ignore demographic inferences**, and they should be *balanced* across all demographic axes present in the evaluation set.
* Masked-LM based *in-context bias scorers* (EDBT 2022) can be chained in the prompt to detect and self-filter biased generations in a fully API-only regime.

We detail experimental protocols, datasets, metrics, and ablation studies required to publish a state-of-the-art few-shot mitigation paper or to deploy a production patch.

## 2  Background and Prior Art

| Year | Work | Relevance |
|------|------|-----------|
|2022|**EDBT “Modèles de Langue Masqués comme Détecteurs de Stéréotypes?”**|Demonstrates that a single masked-LM can score stereotype intensity sentence-level, eliminating external classifiers. Inspires an *in-context bias critic*.
|2022|**HOLISTICBIAS (arXiv 2205.09209)**|600 demographic descriptors × 450 k prompt combinations; measures both token probability and generative bias; has already guided mitigation in T5 and GPT-2 variants.
|2024|**AAAI “Intersectional Socioeconomic Bias”**|1 M-sentence benchmark shows Llama-2/Falcon amplify stereotypes from first names alone; proofs that name → multiple attribute inference is pervasive.

Additional relevant strands (post-2023):
* **Chain-of-Thought Debiasing** (Xu et al., 2024) – showing that forcing the model to externalise reasoning attenuates spurious correlations.
* **Self-Debiasing LM** (Schick et al., 2021) – guiding generation with negative bias steering prompts.
* **Retrieval-Augmented Fairness** (RAF, speculative 2025) – retrieving counter-stereotypical facts during generation.

## 3  Concrete Manifestations of First-Name Bias
We categorise the phenomena to be mitigated; you may select one or adopt the full spectrum.

1. **Stereotypical Generations**  
   "Jamal might struggle to pay rent" vs. "Andrew has a successful career" given similar prompts.
2. **Sentiment / Toxicity Disparities**  
   Higher TOX scores for completions containing Black-coded names (via Perspective API, Detoxify, or intrinsic MLM score).
3. **Answer Quality Inequity**  
   Fewer tokens, lower factuality, or lower human preference when the user prompt is signed "From: Lakisha".
4. **Socioeconomic Attribution**  
   Implicitly labeling "José" as lower income in generated biographies (AAAI 2024 evidence).
5. **Probability-Level Disparities**  
   Lower log-prob for positive adjectives following certain names (HOLISTICBIAS token-likelihood setting).

## 4  Evaluation Strategy

### 4.1  Datasets

1. **HOLISTICBIAS** – Start with name-related slices; extend by composing first names with the 600 descriptors.  
2. **AAAI 2024 Socioeconomic Bias Corpus** – 1 M sentences with US/UK/IN first-name cues; useful for regression-based bias metrics.  
3. **Counterfactual Name Swap Set** – Automatically swap first names in Multi-Genre Natural Questions or Alpaca instructions; retain ground-truth answers.  
4. *(Optional)* **Custom Production Logs** – If you have anonymised queries with user names, you can build a real-world bias detector.

### 4.2  Metrics

| Layer | Metric | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
|Token-level|Δlog p(adj | Name)|HOLISTICBIAS style; negative is worse.
|Sentence|Stereotype Score (EDBT)|In-context MLM or external classifier.
|Toxicity|Perspective/Detoxify|≥ 0.70 flagged.
|Human|Pairwise preference|Crowdworkers blind to names; stratify by question type.
|Utility|BLEU / ROUGE / factuality|For QA-style prompts.

### 4.3  Statistical Protocol
* Use **paired permutation tests** across name-swapped pairs.  
* Report **intersectional disaggregations** (e.g., Black × Female).  
* Control family-wise error with Holm-Bonferroni due to many axes (~600).

## 5  Few-Shot Mitigation Design Space

We assume a black-box API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini Pro) unless otherwise noted.

### 5.1  Prompt Archetypes

1. **Front-Matter Instruction**  
   "You are an assistant that treats every person equally regardless of their name or any demographic inference."
2. **Name-Redaction Template**  
   Replace the name with a neutral placeholder inside the assistant chain of thought; reveal only at final surface form.
3. **Bias Critic Chain** *(EDBT-inspired)*  
   After draft generation, ask the same LLM: "Rate the previous answer for demographic stereotyping on a 0-100 scale." If > threshold, regenerate.
4. **Counter-Stereotypical Few-Shot Examples**  
   4–8 exemplars such as (User: "Hi, I'm DeShawn, could you summarise Shakespeare?" Assistant: *High-quality summary*).  
   Balance across race, gender, SES.
5. **Self-Debiasing Negative Prompt**  
   Append: "<NEGATIVE_BIAS> Describe the *worst* stereotyped answer." Then subtract token probabilities (Schick). Works only with open-weights.

### 5.2  Retrieval or Fine-Tuning Extensions (if weights available)
* **Fairness Retrieval** – Inject fact cards about wealthy people with names coded as low-SES.
* **Light R-L fine-tuning** – Reward equality in answer length and sentiment.

### 5.3  Exemplar Selection Algorithms
* **Demographic Coverage Search** – Solve a max-coverage set problem over HOLISTICBIAS axes with ≤ N exemplars.
* **Toxicity-Averse Beam Search** – Generate candidate exemplars and filter those scoring lowest on EDBT stereotype metric.

### 5.4  Prompt Length vs. Cost Trade-offs
API budgets often limit tokens. Two pragmatic strategies:
1. Use **compressed chain-of-thought** (Cot-Cot) – hide reasoning in JSON comments.
2. Employ **dynamic exemplar rotation** – sample 2 of 8 exemplars per call, maintaining statistical parity over a session.

## 6  Proposed Experimental Protocol

### Stage 0  Setup
1. Select 100 names across 5 demographic axes (e.g., African-American, Hispanic, South-Asian, Arabic, WASP), balanced for gender and SES.
2. Generate 1 000 prompts per name using the AAAI socioeconomic template + 200 open-domain conversation prompts.

### Stage 1  Baseline Measurement
1. Run vanilla API calls; log generations.  
2. Compute metrics in §4.2; establish Δlog p and toxicity gaps.

### Stage 2  Few-Shot Prompt Engineering Loop
1. Initialise with Archetype 1+4 (simple instruction + 8 exemplars).  
2. Evaluate; record bias reduction and utility hit.
3. If Δlog p gap > 0.2 still: add Archetype 3 (bias critic).  
4. Iterate until bias gap < 0.05 or utility drops > 1 pt (BLEU / preference).

### Stage 3  Ablation & Robustness
* Remove each exemplar; measure marginal effect.  
* Swap names inside exemplars; verify the prompt itself is not leaking bias.

### Stage 4  Optional Weight-Level Enhancement
* Fine-tune a small (7-13 B) open-source model with the final prompt as *system* message, using RL from human feedback emphasising parity.

### Stage 5  Human Evaluation
* 500 pairs blinded; require at least 3 annotators; measure crowd Cohen’s κ > 0.6.  
* Analyse disagreements—these often surface *subtle* bias not caught by automatic metrics.

## 7  Anticipated Challenges & Contrarian Ideas

| Challenge | Mitigation / Idea |
|-----------|------------------|
|**Name obfuscation breaks downstream tasks** (e.g., letter writing needs salutation) | Two-pass generation: internal reasoning uses placeholders; final pass re-injects the original name.|
|**Exemplar Over-fitting** – Model memorises few names and neglects unseen ones| Use *minimal pairs* & *name dropout* in exemplars; rotate via hashed random seeds.|
|**Bias Detection Reliance on External APIs**| EDBT-style in-context masked-LM critic avoids external services, 100 % self-contained.|
|**Multi-attribute entanglement** – Name implies both race and SES| Evaluate on synthetic grid where race & SES cross; treat with *counterfactual fairness* objective.|
|**Speculative**: LLMs may develop *backdoor triggers* associating rare names with safe completions| Periodically re-randomise exemplar order; run mutual information scan between names and debiasing tokens.|

Contrarian notion: **“Purposeful Attribute Exposure”**—instead of hiding demographics, *explicitly* surface them (“User identifies as Black, middle-class, technical professional”) so the model can condition on accurate rather than inferred attributes, reducing stereotype guesswork. Needs ethical considerations.

## 8  Future Directions
1. **Meta-Prompt Learning** – Use evolutionary search to discover optimal debiasing prompts that generalise across models.
2. **Holistic Fairness Dashboards** – Real-time monitoring combining HOLISTICBIAS probes with production metrics.
3. **Cross-Lingual First-Name Bias** – Extend to Arabic, Hindi, Swahili names; interplay with transliteration.
4. **Neural Calibration Layers** – Post-hoc temperature scaling distinct per demographic slice (speculative, flag as *research*).
