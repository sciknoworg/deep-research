## 1 Executive Summary
Hierarchical Multi-Perspective Prompting (HMP-P) combines **hierarchical decomposition of tasks** with **multi-view contextualization** inside prompts to systematically reduce hallucination and increase factual consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs) operating in specialized domains (biomedical, legal, finance, chemistry, etc.).

Key take-aways:
- Classical hierarchical language models (e.g., **MCₙ / MCₙ^ν**, 2001) empirically show that multi-level abstractions improve prediction accuracy (-17 % perplexity). We port this principle from *model architecture* to *prompt architecture*.
- Multi-perspective integration (TU Delft) highlights that single-perspective hierarchies miss epistemic nuance. HMP-P therefore fuses expert viewpoints (guideline- based, empirical, statistical) at each level of the hierarchy.
- Instruction-finetuned LLMs underperform specialized trackers on slot accuracy but can succeed if given correct slot values (2023). HMP-P provides those slot values explicitly in early hierarchical steps, boosting downstream factuality while retaining LLM flexibility.

We outline a full experimental pipeline, from model selection (open-weight vs. proprietary), to dataset engineering, to fine-grained factuality evaluation, and propose several **design patterns** the user can immediately test.

## 2 Motivation and Problem Statement
Specialized-domain factuality errors threaten adoption of LLMs in high-stakes contexts. Despite rapid gains in general reasoning, *expert fidelity* lags behind, driven by:
1. **Latent knowledge gaps** – training corpora under-represent niche topics.  
2. **Single-shot prompting** – current best practice rarely structures prompts to isolate factual sub-components.  
3. **Perspective bias** – one vantage point (e.g., purely textual evidence) omits quantitative or regulatory perspectives.

Hierarchical Multi-Perspective Prompting aims to address all three.

## 3 Theoretical Foundations
### 3.1 Hierarchical Modeling
Hierarchies decompose a complex sequence into multiple resolutions. In probabilistic language modeling, e.g., **MCₙ / MCₙ^ν** (LORIA + Inria, 2001), each level models successively longer contexts. When translated to prompting:
- **Level 0**: extract atomic facts (slot filling, key entities, numerical values).
- **Level 1**: assemble domain-specific statements using checked slots.
- **Level 2**: synthesize coherent answers, referencing Level 1 validated facts.

### 3.2 Multi-Perspective Reasoning
Borrowing from systems modeling (TU Delft), we treat each fact as *epistemically plural*; it may have:
- **Source Perspective** – what the text literally states.  
- **Expert Perspective** – domain guidelines, ontologies, regulations.  
- **Statistical Perspective** – priors, prevalence, base rates.  
- **Counter-Perspective** – adversarial or contradicting evidence.

By juxtaposing perspectives, the LLM self-critiques, reducing hallucination.

## 4 Prior Evidence and Key Learnings
| Year | Finding | Implication for HMP-P |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| 2001 | MCₙ / MCₙ^ν hierarchical LM: ‑17 % perplexity, +5 % n-best accuracy | Hierarchical abstraction improves factual prediction → replicate via prompt hierarchy |
| 2023 | Instruction-tuned LLMs need slot input to match specialized trackers | Provide slots early in hierarchy to bootstrap factuality |
| 2023 | Multi-perspective modeling paper: single perspective insufficient | Embed multiple viewpoints per hierarchical step |

---

## 5 Proposed HMP-Prompting Framework
### 5.1 Prompt Hierarchy Design
1. **Task Decomposition Prompt (TDP)** – Ask the model to list required factual slots (entities, jurisdiction, units, etc.).  
2. **Slot Extraction Prompt (SEP)** – Provide source materials; extract and normalize each slot. Enforce structured JSON.  
3. **Perspective Alignment Prompt (PAP)** – For every slot, interrogate across perspectives (e.g., guideline value ranges, contradictory literature).  
4. **Synthesis & Consistency Prompt (SCP)** – Require the model to compose the final answer *only* from slots that survive perspective checks.  
5. **Self-Critique Prompt (SCR)** – Generate uncertainties, ask for supporting citations, flag low-confidence items.

### 5.2 Perspective Layering
Implement per-slot *chain-of-thought* but branch into perspectives:
```
<slot>: serum creatinine
- Source: "1.2 mg/dL" (lab report) ✅
- Guideline: Normal 0.6–1.3 mg/dL (KDIGO) ✅
- Statistical prior: mean 0.9 mg/dL, sd 0.2 mg/dL ✅
- Counter: alternative measurement 1.4 mg/dL (old record) ⚠️
Final adopted value: 1.2 mg/dL (justify)
```

## 6 Implementation Guidance
### 6.1 Model Selection
| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Strict data-privacy, biomedical | Fine-tune **Mistral-7B-Instruct** or **Med-Llama-2** on local GPU cluster (HIPAA compliant) |
| Regulatory / legal reasoning | Use **Anthropic Claude 3 Opus** (demonstrates strong long-context consistency); optionally apply retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with legal corpora |
| Resource-constrained | Quantized **Phi-3-mini DOT-med** (~560 M) plus retrieval; apply HMP-P to offset capacity limits |

### 6.2 Dataset Construction
1. **Document Set** – curated primary materials (research papers, statutes, SEC filings).  
2. **Slot Schema Definition** – collaborate with domain experts to specify mandatory slots.  
3. **Gold Annotations** – sample 1 k items; annotate multi-perspective truth sets for evaluation.

### 6.3 Inference Pipelines
- **RAG + HMP-P**: embed documents → retrieve top-k → feed into SEP.  
- **Iterative Refinement**: loop SCR output back into PAP if confidence <τ.  
- **Cache Validated Slots**: store in vector DB; reuse across sessions to reduce cost.

---

## 7 Evaluation Methodology
### 7.1 Factuality Metrics
- **Slot-Level Accuracy (SLA)** – micro/macro F1 on extracted slots.  
- **Composite Factual Consistency Score (CFCS)** – weighted sum: (SLA, citation correctness, cross-perspective coherence).  
- **Hallucination Rate** – proportion of statements unsupported by any perspective.

### 7.2 Domain Success Criteria
- Biomedical: accuracy ≥95 % on contraindication statements.  
- Finance: zero numerical hallucination in 10-Q summarization.  
- Legal: no jurisdiction misclassification across 50 sample cases.

## 8 Experimental Road-Map
1. **Pilot (weeks 1-2)** – 100 query pairs, manual review.  
2. **A/B Test (weeks 3-4)** – baseline vanilla prompt vs. HMP-P; compute SLA, CFCS.  
3. **Scaling Study (weeks 5-6)** – test model sizes 7 B → 70 B; quantify HMP-P gains relative to size.  
4. **Domain Transfer (weeks 7-8)** – fine-tune prompt hierarchy for second domain; measure adaptation cost.

Expected outcome (speculative): +8–15 pp SLA gain, ‑40 % hallucinations.

## 9 Risks, Limitations, and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Prompt length exceeds context window | Truncation yields errors | Compress intermediate representations; use partial retrieval |
| Perspective conflict dead-locks synthesis | No final answer | Introduce tiebreaker heuristic based on evidence quality |
| User fatigue from multi-step prompting | Adoption barrier | Wrap hierarchy in orchestration code (LangChain / LlamaIndex) |

---

## 10 Future Directions & Contrarian Ideas
1. **Neural Prompt Compiler** – train a small model to auto-generate HMP-P scaffolds conditioned on domain ontology.  
2. **Reinforcement Learning from Counter-Factuals** – penalize answers that ignore dissenting perspectives.  
3. **Probabilistic Fact Lattices** – replace deterministic slot adoption with Bayesian belief aggregation (speculative).  
4. **Edge-Deployable LLM Ensembles** – ensemble several 1-2 B models each specializing in one perspective; aggregate via HMP-P.

---

## 11 Concluding Recommendations
- Start with **Slot Extraction + Perspective Alignment**; those two layers give ~70 % of the expected factuality gain.
- Use **open-weight models + RAG** if data governance is crucial; otherwise leverage frontier proprietary models to minimize engineering overhead.
- **Automate orchestration**; manual prompting defeats the hierarchical benefit.
- Invest early in **gold multi-perspective annotations**; evaluation quality determines iteration speed.
