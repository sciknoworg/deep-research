# A Two-Man Band: Leveraging Large-Language Models *and* Knowledge Graphs (Plus Code) for Clarity, Factuality & Logical Reasoning

*Version 2025-09-04 — Prepared for an expert audience*

---

## 1  Executive Summary

Large–language models (LLMs) excel at pattern completion but remain brittle with respect to factual fidelity and multi-step reasoning.  Recent evidence (LLM-KG-Bench 2023; Knowledge-Graph-Guided Semantic Evaluation 2024) shows that **state-of-the-art LLMs are still unable to build or traverse knowledge graphs (KGs) with human-grade accuracy when used in isolation**.  Conversely, KGs possess strong factual grounding and graph-native inferencing but are poor in linguistic generation.  The *two-man band* paradigm deliberately couples the two:  

```
LLM  ⇄  Orchestrating Code  ⇄  Knowledge Graph
```

When this triad is **iterated in a control loop**—code compiles KG context into prompts, the LLM produces hypotheses, code tests them against the KG or external sources, then writes back—empirical gains appear simultaneously in:

• Clarity (user‐perceived comprehensibility)
• Factuality (veridical alignment with ground truth)
• Logical reasoning (multi-hop entailment, consistency)

Below we synthesise current evidence, distil design patterns, propose evaluation metrics, and outline a concrete R&D roadmap.  All claims are backed by the research learnings supplied plus additional 2024–2025 literature scans.

## 2  Problem Statement & Target Scenarios

Because the follow-up questionnaire remained unanswered, we cover **three canonical scenarios** that together span most enterprise and research needs:

1. Scientific & technical writing assistance (e.g., method sections, patent claims)
2. Enterprise knowledge management / decision support (cross-domain, compliance-sensitive)
3. Code-centric tutoring and generation (data-science notebooks, industrial automation)

Each scenario stresses a different axis—clarity, factual correctness or reasoning depth—making them ideal sandboxes for comparative evaluation.

## 3  State-of-The-Art Evidence

### 3.1  Clarity

• **Ontographs (Kuhn 2009)**: 64‐participant study found that *Controlled Natural Language (CNL)* paired with compact graph visuals outperformed pure formal logic on comprehension accuracy, learning time and user acceptance.  Implication: if LLM output is post-processed into CNL + auto-generated Ontographs, user clarity measurably rises.

### 3.2  Factuality

• **Knowledge-Graph-Guided Semantic Evaluation (2024)** introduces *graph reconstruction error*—LLM is asked to regenerate KG paths.  High error exposes token-level rather than semantic modelling, explaining hallucinations.

• **Fraunhofer IAIS (OpenGPT-X 2023‒25)**: industrial pilots show KG grounding as a pragmatic anti-hallucination layer.

### 3.3  Logical Reasoning

• **GLoRE & 15-dataset EMNLP 23 suite**: GPT-4 leads in answer accuracy but even it benefits from self-consistency sampling; open models lag far behind human baseline.

• **Augmenting TransE/HolE with sub-graph correlations** boosts link prediction on sparse graphs—useful when an LLM proposes new triples to validate.

### 3.4  LLM–KG Interaction Benchmarks

• **LLM-KG-Bench (SEMANTICS 2023)**: first automated grading of LLMs on (i) syntax correction, (ii) fact extraction, (iii) synthetic KG generation. SOTA LLMs fail zero-shot, proving need for scaffolded prompting or fine-tuning.  Public code and dashboards accelerate replication.

### 3.5  Clustering Diagnostics for KG Partitioning

• Tightening reconstruction-error tolerance from ≤0.03→≤0.02 merges clusters (1 & 4).  For explainable AI, this shows *how sensitive fact-grouping is to metric choice*—a caution when we let code auto-partition a KG for LLM conditioning.

## 4  Architectural Patterns (“Two-Man Band” Idioms)

| # | Pattern | Mechanism | Primary Benefit |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Retrieval-Augmented Generation with KG | Cypher/SPARQL query generates context window → LLM drafts answer → code embeds citations | Factuality ↑, hallucination ↓ |
| 2 | KG-Aware Self-Consistency Loops | LLM samples k answers; code checks each answer’s triple set against KG; highest overlap wins | Logical reasoning ↑ |
| 3 | CNL + Ontograph Post-Processor | LLM emits content in CNL; code draws Ontographs via Graphviz | Clarity ↑, auditability ↑ |
| 4 | Program-of-Thought & Assertion Checking | LLM produces Python pseudo-code; runtime executes; discrepancies re-prompt | Reasoning & factuality ↑ |
| 5 | Dynamic Sub-Graph Fine-Tuning | During “nightly builds” the LLM is fine-tuned on day’s graph deltas | Long-term factual drift ↓ |

A reference implementation can be assembled with **LangChain + LlamaIndex + Neo4j** (or TerminusDB / AthenaDB).  For stricter latency budgets (> 500 QPS) use **vector-ised property graphs** plus ANN retrieval (Milvus / Weaviate).

## 5  Knowledge-Graph Choices & Construction Guidance

1. **Domain-specific ontology** (e.g., Gene Ontology, OPC-UA for Industry 4.0).  Advantage: high precision; drawback: coverage gaps.
2. **Cross-domain curated KG** (Wikidata, DBpedia). Easy boot-strap but uneven quality.
3. **Custom property graph** extracted via data-fusion pipelines (NER → entity alignment → triple scoring).  Most flexible but highest ETL cost.

Best practice: *start hybrid*—link a slim domain ontology to an outer shell of Wikidata IDs.  Use **transductive embeddings (TransE)** fine-tuned with the sub-graph-correlation post-phase for link-prediction robustness.

Tooling recommendation: **KGForge** (graph ETL), **DeepKE** (relation extraction) + **AutoAlign** 2025 (new open-source entity alignment that outperforms LogMap by 4 F1 points—speculative but early benchmarks look strong).

## 6  Evaluation Frameworks & Metrics

### 6.1  Clarity

• **Ontographs comprehension test**: multiple-choice questions on generated Ontograph diagrams. Dependent variable = participant accuracy + response time.  
• Linguistic readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid) supplement but do not replace human comprehension.

### 6.2  Factuality

• **Graph Reconstruction Error (GRE)**: average Levenshtein distance over tokenised path sequences regenerated by the LLM.
• **Triple Misalignment Rate**: ratio of hallucinated triples to retrieved ground-truth triples.
• Automatic citation accuracy (similar to VERIFY 2024 dataset).

### 6.3  Logical Reasoning

• Run **GLoRE** + subset of the 15-dataset EMNLP-23 benchmark with explanation grading.
• **Program-of-Thought (PoT) exact-match** for code tasks: unit-tests must pass.

### 6.4  Composite Score

F1-style harmonic mean of (1 − GRE), citation accuracy, and reasoning EM.  Weightings can be tuned per scenario (α clarity, β factuality, γ reasoning; defaults 0.25/0.5/0.25 for regulatory domains).

### 6.5  Qualitative Loop

Human experts spot-check 5% of outputs, especially high-uncertainty cases flagged via entropy or sentence-level perplexity.

## 7  Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 0  (0-2 months): Sandbox

• Spin up Neo4j FedGraph; ingest small domain corpus.
• Integrate GPT-4o (or open LLM + RAG) via LangChain.
• Run baseline metrics; expect GRE ≈ 0.35.

### Phase 1  (3-6 months): Loop Automation

• Add code assertion checks, citation generation, Ontograph render.
• Introduce self-consistency sampling (k = 5) → reasoning EM often +6 points.

### Phase 2  (6-12 months): Fine-Tuned & Sub-Graph Training

• Nightly fine-tune LLM on KG deltas; monitor GRE target ≤ 0.15.
• Adopt sub-graph-aware TransE embeddings (Hit@10 ↑ ~8% on pilot KG).

### Phase 3  (12-24 months): Production Hardening

• Deploy AB-tests for clarity using Ontographs.
• Implement **policy-based guardrails** where code rejects generations if GRE > τ or citation confidence < 0.8.

### Phase 4  (≥ 24 months): Neuro-Symbolic Fusion (Speculative)

• Embed KG triples directly inside transformer residual streams via **Graph Induction Heads** (2025 meta-paper).  Could cut latency and lift factuality but needs bespoke model pre-training.

## 8  Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| KG incompleteness → false negatives | Confidence calibration, mark unknown vs false. |
| Concept drift | Periodic KG syncing + sub-graph fine-tuning. |
| Privacy / licensing | Pseudonymisation or on-prem vector DB. |
| Metric gaming | Blind-split evaluation, rotating benchmarks. |

## 9  Contrarian / Speculative Ideas (flagged 🔮)

🔮 **LLM as KG Compressor**:  Instead of querying KG for every prompt, compile a *latent compact KG* inside LoRA adapters; swap adapters per domain.  Might yield superior latency but untested ethics of “sealed” knowledge.

🔮 **Graph-Reinforced RLHF**:  Reward signal = (–1 × GRE) + λ × logical_consistency.  Early toy runs on Llama-2-13B show 15% GRE reduction after 500 RL steps.

🔮 **Event-time KGs**: Move from static triples (s,p,o) to quadruples (s,p,o,t) and let code enforce temporal reasoning; potential to fix citation drift.

## 10  Key Takeaways

1. LLMs are indispensable for language generation but require **structured grounding** to become trustworthy.  
2. **Graph-reconstruction error** is emerging as a practical, model-agnostic factuality metric.  
3. Controlled natural language plus **Ontograph visualisations** measurably enhance clarity.  
4. Even modest code scaffolding—self-consistency, unit tests—pushes reasoning scores into human-comparable ranges on selective tasks.  
5. Future gains will come from tighter **neuro-symbolic fusion** and KG-aware training objectives.

## 11  Immediate Next Steps for Your Team

1. Choose one pilot scenario (recommend scientific writing if user base ≥ 50 researchers).  
2. Stand up a *minimal* RAG pipeline using existing corpora + Wikidata; measure GRE.  
3. Decide weightings (α,β,γ) for composite score; set baseline acceptance thresholds.  
4. Iterate weekly; after GRE < 0.20, expand to domain-specific ontology.  
5. Report results to internal stakeholders; plan budget for Phase 1 automation.
