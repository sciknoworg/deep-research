### Abstract
Large-language-model (LLM) code assistants now routinely decompose natural-language requests into *plans* before emitting code. 2023‐era evidence (arXiv 2303.06689) shows that such **self-planning** substantially outperforms direct generation.  Yet three pain points remain: (i) scalability limits caused by expensive grounding of symbolic plans into concrete programming artifacts (Koller & Stone 2008), (ii) brittle context windows that lose salient information across multi-turn interactions, and (iii) frustrating iterative refinement loops in practical use (TU Delft CSE3000 study, 2023).  

We argue that injecting an additional representational layer—**Chain-of-Context (CoC)**—between the self-planner and the code emitter alleviates all three problems.  CoC is a dynamically maintained, structured memory of *task-local* entities, constraints and design decisions accumulated over turns. It plays the dual role of (1) *grounding cache* that prunes irrelevant search branches and (2) *conversational substrate* that lets the user and the model negotiate changes with minimal context loss.  

This report synthesizes prior findings, proposes a concrete architecture, and details an experimental plan aimed at Python, TypeScript and SQL generation with GPT-4o and CodeLlama-70B as back-ends.  Core success metrics include pass@k code correctness, grounding latency, user edit overhead, and conversation satisfaction.  We close with speculative extensions—e.g., neurosymbolic constraint solvers, retrieval-augmented CoC, and federated privacy-preserving interaction logs.

## 1  Introduction
LLM-based code generation has moved from academic curiosity to daily tooling.  State-of-the-art systems increasingly rely on *explicit decomposition*: the LLM first produces a step-wise plan, then conditions final code on that plan.  However, two critical gaps persist:

1. **Grounding Bottleneck** – Translating high-level plans into concrete code tokens requires resolving variable names, library functions, and domain constraints. In early NLG planners (FF, SG-PLAN) more than 80 % of runtime vanished into grounding (Koller & Stone 2008); modern code setups show analogous slow-downs when large API/universe look-ups are needed.
2. **Context Drift in Multi-Turn Scenarios** – Real users iterate.  Each turn adds or retracts requirements, but LLM context windows force either expensive re-serialization or loss of earlier rationale (TU Delft).  Subtle inconsistencies accumulate, degrading correctness and user trust.

We posit **Chain-of-Context**—a fine-grained, structured trace of *what decisions were made, why, and under what assumptions*—as a principled remedy.  By threading CoC through the self-planning pipeline we aim to:

* Reduce redundant grounding operations via memoisation.
* Provide the LLM an always-up-to-date, compressed view of task state.
* Surface to the user an editable ledger of assumptions, enabling precise corrections instead of ad-hoc re-prompting.

## 2  Background and Related Work
### 2.1  Self-Planning
* **arXiv 2303.06689 (2023)** introduced a two-phase protocol: *Plan* → *Execute*.  GPT-4 produced plans of up to 8 steps, then generated code conditioned on the serialized plan.  Gains of +9 to +17 pp pass@1 were reported on HumanEval and MBPP.
* Follow-up industry deployments (unpublished, 2024) show similar trends but report brittleness when tasks exceed a single file or entail environment setup (conda, Docker etc.).

### 2.2  Grounding Complexity
* **Koller & Stone 2008** quantified grounding overhead in symbolic planners for NLG: >80 % runtime in grounding, despite the search being trivial once variables are instantiated.
* The **same pathology** emerges in code generation: mapping plan operators like “read CSV” or “train XGBoost” into library calls (`pandas.read_csv`, `xgboost.XGBClassifier`) can explode combinatorially when searching across entire dependency graphs.

### 2.3  Interactive Code Assistants
* **TU Delft CSE3000 (2023)**: First-shot success ≈50 %; rises to 75 % after iterative prompting.  User frustration stems largely from having to restate earlier constraints or remind the LLM of choices made several turns ago.
* Commercial tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, TabNine) mitigate via conversation panes, but rely on heuristic snippet windows; decisions may silently be dropped.

### 2.4  Chain-of-Context (CoC)
Although “CoC” is not yet standard nomenclature, related ideas include:
* **Memory editing & scratchpads** – storing intermediate reasoning artifacts (Yao et al., 2023).
* **Semantic graphs for dialogue state** – e.g., SPARQL-backed assistants.
* **Program sketches** – partial code templates that are iteratively filled.

We synthesise these under a unified, formalised CoC interface.

## 3  Problem Statement
Given a natural-language coding task *T* posed over multi-turn dialogue *D*, design a system that generates correct, executable code *C* with minimal latency and user friction.  We hypothesise that augmenting self-planning with an explicit **Chain-of-Context** *Φ* improves:

1. Pass@k correctness on benchmark tasks.
2. Grounding time per generated artefact.
3. Number of clarification turns needed.
4. Subjective satisfaction (Likert 1–7).

## 4  Proposed Approach
### 4.1  Pipeline Overview
```
User NL Query → Self-Planner (LLM) → Plan P
        ↓                         ↑
   CoC Manager  ←–  Δ (diff) –—  : updates Φ
        ↓
CoC-Aware Code Emitter (LLM) → Candidate Code C
        ↓
Verifier (tests/static) → Feedback → User / Planner
```

1. **Self-Planner**: Produces a structured YAML/JSON plan (steps, pre-conds, post-conds).  We fine-tune the planner to emit *CoC-anchors*—unique IDs for entities and constraints.
2. **CoC Manager**: Maintains graph *Φ* (nodes: entities, decisions; edges: depends-on, overrides, references).  Diff algorithms reconcile new planner output with Φ, flag conflicts.
3. **CoC-Aware Emitter**: Receives *(P, Φ)*.  Prompts emphasise binding variable names to anchors, re-using prior APIs, and respecting constraints.
4. **Verifier**: Runs unit tests, static type checks (mypy, tsc).  On failure, produces structured error objects fed back into Φ and the planner.

### 4.2  Grounding Optimisations
* **Memoised Symbol Resolution** – Each (library symbol, semantics) pair cached in Φ; future grounding avoids duplicate API search.
* **Deferred Grounding** – Planner may output abstract operator `LoadData[fmt='csv']`; emitter resolves into concrete code when call site context (pandas, PySpark) becomes clear.
* **Constraint Propagation** – Φ forms a light-weight CSP; early pruning when incompatible constraints detected (e.g., GPU required but environment lacks CUDA).

### 4.3  Interaction Design
* **Editable CoC Ledger** – Side panel lists decisions (“DataFrame library: pandas”; “plotting: seaborn”).  User can click to override, triggering targeted re-grounding instead of full re-generation.
* **Contextual Diff Prompts** – When user changes a spec (“Use Polars not pandas”), planner sees diff patches rather than long natural-language recaps.
* **Explain-on-Demand** – Each CoC node stores rationale snippets; clicking reveals chain-of-thought without cluttering main chat.

### 4.4  System Architecture
Hardware: single-tenant container with 2×A100 80 GB for model inference; RedisGraph for Φ; Postgres for logs.  Software components:

| Component | Tech | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Planner LLM | GPT-4o-128K | High-context reasoning |
| Emitter LLM | CodeLlama-70B-Instruct | Lower-latency code gen |
| Verifier | PyTest, ESLint, SQLFluff | Task-specific suites |
| Φ Store | RedisGraph + JSON | Sub-1 ms look-up |
| UI | React + Monaco | In-browser CoC ledger |


## 5  Research Questions & Hypotheses
RQ1  Does CoC-augmented self-planning improve pass@1 correctness over vanilla self-planning?  
H1: ≥ +5 pp absolute on HumanEval-plus.

RQ2  How does CoC impact grounding latency?  
H2: Median grounding time ↓ 30 % versus baseline memoisation.

RQ3  Do users perceive reduced *interaction overhead*?  
H3: Average clarifying turns per task ≤ 1.2 (baseline 2.4 per TU Delft).

RQ4  Is performance robust across languages (Python, TS, SQL)?  
H4: Benefits hold within ±1 pp across target languages.

## 6  Experimental Plan
### 6.1  Datasets & Tasks
* **HumanEval-plus (Python)** – 164 tasks w/ hidden tests.
* **WebQuery-X (TypeScript/React)** – 80 UI + API tasks.
* **Sakila-SQLBench** – 60 analytics queries.
* **Real-World GitHub Issues** – 200 anonymised tickets.

### 6.2  Models
1. GPT-4o-128K (planner);  gpt-4o, no RLHF override.
2. CodeLlama-70B-Instruct (emitter) running v-llama.cpp.
*Fine-tuning:* single-stage SFT on plan-annotated code dataset (1.2 M pairs, Apache-2.0).

### 6.3  Baselines
A) Direct generation (no planning).  
B) Self-planning w/o CoC (replicates arXiv 2303.06689).  
C) CoC but no user interaction (one-shot) – isolates grounding benefit.

### 6.4  Metrics
* **pass@k (k = 1, 3)** – functional correctness.
* **Grounding Latency** – ms from plan ready → emitter start.
* **Turns-to-Success** – NL turns until tests pass.
* **Context Token Footprint** – avg tokens sent per turn.
* **User Satisfaction** – post-task SUS + NASA-TLX.

### 6.5  Ablations
1. Remove memoised symbol resolution.
2. Limit Φ window to last N nodes.
3. Swap planner/emitter model capacities.

## 7  Anticipated Challenges
* **Φ Bloat** – Long sessions may accumulate thousands of nodes; aggressive summarisation or eviction policy needed.
* **Planner-Emitter Misalignment** – If anchors drift, emitter may hallucinate IDs; schema validation and auto-repair heuristics required.
* **Evaluation Leakage** – HumanEval clones appear in pre-training of GPT-4o.  Use held-out custom test suites.
* **Security / Privacy** – CoC stores potentially sensitive code context; encryption-at-rest and differential privacy logging advisable.

## 8  Opportunities & Contrarian Ideas
1. **Neurosymbolic Solvers** – Replace classic grounding with GNN-augmented constraint solvers that learn grounding heuristics.
2. **Retrieval-Augmented CoC** – Store Φ snapshots in a vector DB; similar historical contexts bootstrap new tasks.
3. **Federated CoC Learning** – Clients keep Φ local; distilled gradient updates fine-tune emitter without exposing code.
4. **Self-Healing Plans** – On verifier failure, use planning-level edits (insert step “install package”) rather than raw patch generation.
5. **Language-Independent IR** – Emit an intermediate representation (e.g., PABS – *Portable Abstract Build Script*) then transpile, enabling cross-language reuse.

## 9  Conclusion
Historical evidence pinpoints grounding cost and context drift as bottlenecks in plan-based code generation. Our proposed **Chain-of-Context** layer acts as an explicit, manipulable memory that bridges planning, grounding, and user collaboration. We anticipate marked gains in correctness (+5 pp), latency (-30 %), and user satisfaction, validated across Python, TypeScript and SQL.  Furthermore, CoC offers a foundation for future innovations such as federated learning and symbolic-neural hybrids.  If successful, this paradigm could generalise beyond code to data-analysis notebooks, infra-as-code, and even legal drafting—any domain where multi-turn, plan-conditioned text generation benefits from persistent, structured context.
