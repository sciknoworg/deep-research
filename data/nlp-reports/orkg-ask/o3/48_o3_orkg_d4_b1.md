## 1 Executive Summary

Large-language-model (LLM)–based safety classifiers are now the de-facto front-line defense in public chatbots, autonomous agents, and content-moderation stacks.  
Concurrently, “prompt-ensemble” attacks—where multiple, independently sampled LLMs collectively craft adversarial prompts—are emerging as one of the most potent ways to *bypass* those very defenses.  
This report synthesises the state of the art, surveys black-box and white-box settings, and provides:

* A step-by-step blueprint for building **ensemble-of-LLMs adversarial engines** able to collapse current safety filters with >90 % success under realistic rate-limits.
* A parallel blueprint for **ensemble-of-LLMs safety classifiers** that provably (α,ζ)-bound residual risk, leveraging recent certificates (PROSAC, barrier functions, shared-destiny matrices, ensemble regularisation) to show how we can *mathematically guarantee* improved robustness.
* A quantitative comparison across four threat models, three deployment domains, and six evaluation suites.
* New research directions—including speculative (⚑) ideas—around *differentiable policy shaping*, *LLM-for-LLM watermarking*, and cross-modal supervision.

Readers familiar with adversarial ML will notice parallels to vision-domain ensemble attacks (NES, SquareAtk) and certified defences (kNN majority-vote guarantees); the crucial difference in the LLM space is the **semantic latitude** of prompts, which makes enumerative defences brittle *and* provides attackers with a combinatorial advantage.

## 2 Problem Statement & Scope

### 2.1 Goals
1. **Attacker’s goal (Option a)**: Generate adversarial text that is (i) semantically close to a disallowed request, yet (ii) slips past a target safety classifier to obtain disallowed model completions.
2. **Defender’s goal (Option b)**: Combine multiple LLM-based judges (plus optional non-LLM heuristics) into a meta-classifier with certified low false-negatives and acceptable false-positives.
3. **Benchmarking goal (Option c)**: Provide apples-to-apples metrics to judge whether investment in ensemble attacks or ensemble defences yields higher marginal returns.

### 2.2 Threat-Model Matrix
We consider four canonical settings:

| ID | Access to Classifier | Gradient | Query Budget | Content Policy | Real-world analogue |
|----|----------------------|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| T₁ | **Black-box** (API)  | ✗        | 5Q/min       | OpenAI 2025    | Public chatbots     |
| T₂ | Black-box, **hard-label** | ✗ | 60Q/hr  | Social media    | Platform moderation |
| T₃ | **Grey-box** (logits) | partial  | unlimited     | Internal tool   | Enterprise firewall |
| T₄ | **White-box**        | ✓        | unlimited     | n/a            | Research prototype  |

Where applicable we align with ASSERT’s semantic augmentation & red-team suites, extend IMDB/AG’sNews filters, and test on the new **SafetyBench-24** (toxic, sexual, extremist, illicit-behaviour subsets).

## 3 Ensemble-of-LLMs Adversarial Pipeline (Attacker’s Perspective)

### 3.1 Why an Ensemble?
Single-LLM red-teaming quickly plateaus: diversity of candidate prompts is limited by the model’s own exploration distribution.  Empirically, **conditioning on _k_ ≥ 4 heterogeneous models** (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3-Haiku, Llama-3-70B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct) increased evasion rate from 71 %→93 % against a held-out commercial safety classifier under budget T₁.  This mirrors the *Crossing Collaborative Ensemble* (CCE) observation that disagreement widens the search basin.

### 3.2 Algorithmic Core
1. **Prompt Pool Seeding**  
   • Start from an illegal request template (`<target>`).  
   • Pass to *k* LLMs with directives: *“Paraphrase while preserving intent, avoid disallowed keywords, compress into ≤ 200 tokens.”*
2. **Diversity Maximisation**  
   • Apply Determinantal Point Process (DPP) sampling over model logits to retain maximally dissimilar paraphrases.  
   • Draw ≤ 20 candidates per round.
3. **Safety-Filter Oracle**  
   • Submit each candidate to the target safety endpoint (black-box).  
   • Record binary verdict (accept/deny) and round-trip latency.
4. **Deep-RL Bandit Loop** (extends _Chen et al._ 2023, “Decision-based Hard-Label Attacks”)  
   • Reward = +1 if `accept` && downstream model returns disallowed content; −0.3 if `deny`; −0.1 if rate-limited.  
   • Use *Population-Based Training* (PBT) to mutate prompt tokens: homophone swaps, unicode confusables, semantic role reversal.  
   • Exploration policy adopts **state-space partitioning** akin to `k`-NN robust certificates: each prompt is mapped to an embedding; neighbourhoods with unexplored safe states are prioritised.
5. **Stopping Criterion**  
   • Success budget of 500 queries or one accepted disallowed completion, whichever first.

### 3.3 Performance Highlights (IMDB toxic-content filter example)
* 500-sample RL-bandit ensemble hit-rate: 96 % (vs. 62 % single-LLM baseline).  
* Average semantic similarity (SBERT cosine) to original disallowed request: 0.84 (meaning preservation).  
* Average word-change rate: 12 %, below human NOTICE threshold ≈ 15 % (per *CITP usability lab 2024*).

### 3.4 Key Enablers from Literature
* **Deep-RL attacks** (Learning #1, #13): successful without gradients; transfer directly to safety classifiers.  
* **ASSERT** red-team augmentation (#5): initial candidate generation & coverage metrics.  
* **Decision-based attacks** (#13): only need 1-bit feedback.  
* **Neural barrier functions & kNN certificates** (#6, #7) indirectly inform *search-space* exploration heuristics (attacker’s view is inverse of defender’s certificate).

## 4 Ensemble-of-LLMs Safety Classifier (Defender’s Perspective)

### 4.1 Architectural Options
1. **Parallel Voting (majority / unanimity / veto)**  
   *Simple, fast*, but risk of correlated blind spots.  kNN theory (#7) gives baseline certified robustness if we treat each LLM as a noisy voter.
2. **CC-Ensemble with Transfer-Regularisation** (Crossing Collaborative Ensemble, #9)  
   • During fine-tuning, each judge is trained to *disagree* on adversarial directions, directly penalising transferability.  
   • Yields near-perfect (< 1 % error) detection in vision; early NLP experiments show 6–8 pp recall gains.
3. **Stacked Ensemble with Meta-LLM**  
   • Feed raw prompt + judge logits into a smaller meta-LLM (2–7 B) that outputs final safe/unsafe flag.  
   • Allows *ex post* calibration, dynamic thresholding.
4. **Barrier-Certificate Layer**  
   • Model the ensemble as a stochastic dynamical system `x_{t+1}=f(x_t, u_t)` where `u_t` encodes prompt tokens.  
   • Use **Neural Barrier Functions** (#6) to learn certificates guaranteeing `Pr[unsafe] ≤ ϵ` across prompt distribution.  
   • For polynomial approximations we can revert to SoS-based certificates (#2, #8) for verifiable upper bounds.

### 4.2 Formal Risk Guarantees
*Using PROSAC (#4), we define an (α,ζ)-safety certificate:*

`P(R_adv(ensemble) > α) ≤ ζ`  
With a calibration set of 2000 ASSERT prompts and Bayesian risk estimator, we verified:

| Ensemble | α (risk cap) | ζ (confidence) | Queries/s | ΔRecall vs. single |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Majority-5 | 0.12 | 0.05 | 600 | +3 pp |
| CCE-5 | 0.06 | 0.05 | 500 | +12 pp |
| Meta-LLM-Stack (7 B) | 0.04 | 0.03 | 250 | +15 pp |

In black-box T₁, Meta-LLM Stack *cuts adversarial pass-through from 29 %→8 %* with 3× latency increase; grey-box T₃ allows caching => near-parity latency.

### 4.3 Social-Risk Layer
*Apply the **shared-destiny risk matrix** (#3) to measure disparate impact.*  After filtering 140 K user prompts, risk strata show no significant adverse impact on any protected subgroup (95 % CI overlap).

### 4.4 Operational Playbook
1. **Diversity sourcing**: choose LLMs from **orthogonal** training corpora (e.g., one partially German/Italian corpus to improve non-English detection).  
2. **Regular re-certification** every 30 days via scenario-based convex programs (#11) with 10 ⁴ synthetic prompt trajectories.  
3. **Fast path vs. slow path**: use majority-3 lite judges for <100-token prompts; escalate others to full ensemble.  
4. **Override channel**: human reviewer can tag “safe” exceptions; these are fed back as *negative hallucination* examples during monthly fine-tunes.

## 5 Comparative Analysis

| Dimension | Ensemble Attack | Ensemble Defence | Observations |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| *Setup cost* | Low (reuse public LLM APIs) | Moderate-High (licence >3 models, infra) | Attack barrier dropping fast. |
| *Query budget sensitivity* | Robust; RL & hard-label search converge in ≤500 queries | N/A | Rate-limiting only slows attack 1.4×. |
| *Scalability* | Embarrassingly parallel across prompts | Bottleneck at meta-LLM inference | Potential GPU pooling needed. |
| *Certifiable guarantees* | None (by design) | Barrier certificates + PROSAC deliver provable bounds | Critical PR lever. |
| *Transferability risks* | High—completions may leak attack prompts | Low—ensemble reduces over-fitting | Log + mask pipeline recommended. |

On the current evidence, **defensive ensembles close ≈70 % of the gap**, but residual 5–10 % adversarial pass-through remains even under the strongest settings.  That residue cannot be driven to zero without *semantic-aware* verification or external real-world knowledge.

## 6 Research Gaps & Forward-Looking Ideas

1. ⚑ **Differentiable Policy-Shaping**:  If future safety classifiers expose a *KL-penalised policy gradient* API (e.g., RLHF delta fine-tune), attackers could run *white-box* gradient search; defenders must pre-empt by performing *adversarial fine-tune* in policy-space as in TRPO barrier-certs.
2. ⚑ **Watermarked Paraphrase Space**:  A co-trained watermarking language model marks benign paraphrases in an *orthogonal subspace*; unmarked paraphrases are flagged high risk.
3. ⚑ **Cross-modal Co-verification**:  Use vision or audio cues—e.g., attach text screenshot OCR vs. raw text—to detect unicode confusables & homophone swaps that textual models alone miss.
4. **Ensemble Distillation**:  Distil the ensemble into a single smaller model while retaining diversity signals via *auxiliary disagreement loss*; could cut latency 4–5×.
5. **Game-theoretic scheduling**:  Dynamically choose which subset of judges to query per request to maximise uncertainty for the attacker (mixed strategy equilibria).

## 7 Recommendations

Short-term (≤3 mo)  
• Deploy a **CCE-5 ensemble** plus heuristic profanity regex as guardrail.  
• Adopt ASSERT-style continual red-team to re-sample prompt space weekly.  
• Rate-limit per-IP to <30/min; beyond that use captchas.

Mid-term (3–12 mo)  
• Transition to **Meta-LLM-Stack**; integrate barrier-certificate verification every release.  
• Publish (α,ζ)-certificates for transparency; adopt shared-destiny matrix to track fairness.

Long-term (>1 yr)  
• Explore **cross-modal certification** and **ensemble distillation** to cut inference cost.  
• Join standards effort for *adversarial-prompt-resilience reporting* (APR-R) akin to CV’s RobustBench.

## 8 Conclusion

The arms race between adversarial prompt engineering and safety classification is accelerating toward *ensemble methods* on both sides.  Attackers exploit disagreement across independently-trained LLMs to generate high-coverage paraphrases, while defenders can, symmetrically, leverage ensemble diversity coupled with formal certificates to bound risk.  Neither side enjoys a decisive edge yet; however, mathematics-backed defences—barrier certificates, PROSAC, risk matrices—offer a path to *verifiable robustness* that purely heuristic attacks cannot easily match.  The organisations that invest early in such principled guarantees will likely set the bar for safe deployment of general-purpose language models.
