# Final Report: The Impact of Climate Change on Bees

This technical report synthesizes and integrates current research findings on the multifaceted impacts of climate change on bees. Drawing from both experimental manipulations and large-scale field studies, the report assesses physiological, behavioral, and ecological outcomes in bees ranging from bumble bees (Bombus spp.) to solitary species such as Osmia and Ceratina. In light of climate-induced shifts, we detail the consequences on foraging behavior, phenology, morphology, and pollination services. This report is structured into multiple sections covering thermoregulation, species-specific responses, life history trait mediations, regional variations, and synergistic stressor effects.

## 1. Overview of Climate Change Effects on Bees

Climate change, characterized by increasing ambient temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, affects bee populations at multiple levels. The effects span from extended foraging periods and altered nest microclimates to significant phenological shifts and morphological changes. In both managed (honey bees) and wild pollinator communities, changing temperature regimes interfere with critical behaviors such as foraging, mating, and overwintering. Such disruptions risk destabilizing pollination networks essential for crop productivity and natural ecosystems.

## 2. Thermoregulatory and Foraging Responses

### 2.1. Thermoregulation in Bumble Bees

Studies on bumble bees have demonstrated contrasting thermal responses depending on nest placement:

- **Belowground Nests:** Warmer ambient temperatures extended foraging activities and reduced the energy costs for nest-heating. This potentially benefits colonies by improving foraging efficiency and reducing the resource burden for nest maintenance.

- **Aboveground Nests:** In contrast, elevated temperatures for aboveground nests can impose unsustainable cooling demands. The inability to efficiently dissipate heat may lead to a cascade of negative consequences including nest stress and potential disruption of the synchrony with plant phenologies.

This dichotomy highlights that even within a single genus, nesting behavior and location significantly modulate the physiological responses to climate warming.

### 2.2. Behavioral Adjustments and Foraging Efficiency

Elevated developmental temperatures (for example, Bombus terrestris reared at 33°C versus 27°C) directly influence worker bees’ foraging behaviors:

- **Increased Visiting Rates:** Workers exposed to high rearing temperatures exhibited increased visitation rates with shorter per-flower occupancy durations.

- **Reduced Number of Foragers:** Notably, wild colonies demonstrated a reduction in the overall number of foraging individuals, a phenomenon that could cumulatively impair colony-level pollination efficiency.

- **Morphological Changes:** Altered wing size and shape may further impede long-distance foraging and navigation under warmer conditions.

The convergence of these factors suggests that even minor thermal shifts can have cascading effects on individual performance and, by extension, ecosystem-level pollination services.

## 3. Species-Specific Impacts and the Role of Life History Traits

### 3.1. Overwintering Strategies and Phenological Shifts

The responses to warming conditions vary considerably among bee species, largely due to differences in life history traits and overwintering strategies:

- **Solitary Bees (Adult vs. Prepupae):** Experimental evidence indicates that solitary bees overwintering as prepupae tend to exhibit less pronounced reductions in body size and longevity when compared to adults. These bees present with fewer phenological advances, suggesting a lower vulnerability to mismatches between emergence and flowering times. On average, phenological advances reached up to 6.5 days per °C increase. Conversely, adult bees are more susceptible to mismatches and exhibit more marked declines in physiological performance. 

- **Implications for Pollination Networks:** Such shifts in emergence timing, including upward shifts in elevation (e.g., ~317 m in some cases), disrupt the synchrony with host plant flowering. This asynchrony can impair mutualistic interactions that are central to ecosystem resilience and crop production.

### 3.2. Effects on Morphology and Lifespan

Elevated temperatures not only shift phenology but also impact morphology and lifespan:

- **Body Size Reductions:** The overall trend of reduced body size under higher developmental temperatures points toward potential losses in flight capability and altered foraging strategies.

- **Lifespan Declines:** Reduced longevity, as observed in studies on species such as Osmia cornuta (especially when compounded with pesticide stress), further endangers colony sustainability and long-term population viability.

These findings underscore the importance of considering species-specific overwintering and developmental traits in predictive models of climate change responses.

## 4. Regional Variation and Landscape-Level Implications

### 4.1. Contrasting Regional Outcomes

Regional differences in climate models and land-use patterns result in divergent futures for bee populations. Key examples include:

- **Australia:** For species like Ceratina australensis, predictive models under intense warming scenarios (e.g., IPCC RCP8.5 conditions for 2070) forecast an expansion of suitable habitat, particularly in densely urbanized coastal areas. This suggests the potential for bees to adapt in or migrate to more urbanized zones where microclimatic conditions might be more favorable.

- **Brazil and the Eastern Amazon:** In stark contrast, up to 95% of native bee species in ecosystems such as the Atlantic Moist Forest, including species like Melipona bicolor, could face drastic reductions in suitable occurrence area. This indicates a high risk of local extinctions or severe declines in biodiversity in such sensitive habitats.

These regional studies highlight that the spatial impacts of climate change are not uniform, demanding region-specific conservation strategies and adaptive management practices.

### 4.2. Modulated Foraging from Floral Temperature Dynamics

Research from southern Australia has shown that climate change not only affects bees directly but also indirectly influences them through changes in flower temperature profiles:

- **Non-linear Relationships:** Studies on species such as Erysimum linifolium and Polygala grandiflora reveal that ambient temperatures influence petal temperatures in a non-linear fashion. This creates scenarios where bees may shift their foraging preferences depending on temperature fluctuations. For instance, bees might switch from favoring warm-nectar provisioned flowers at lower temperatures to seeking out cooler floral resources when ambient temperatures exceed 30°C.

Such findings are crucial for understanding pollinator behavior under fluctuating climatic conditions and underscore the complex interplay between abiotic and biotic factors in pollination networks.

## 5. Synergistic Stressors and Cumulative Impacts

Climate change rarely acts in isolation. Instead, it compounds other stressors that bees face, leading to a synergistic effect that could exacerbate population declines:

- **Pesticide Interactions:** For instance, studies on Osmia cornuta revealed that warm winter conditions in concert with high doses of the insecticide sulfoxaflor resulted in a staggering 70% reduction in lifespan. This synergy demonstrates that climate change may magnify the toxicity or negative outcomes of anthropogenic chemicals.

- **Agricultural Intensification:** Research records from Belgium over a 70-year period document an average 4-day advance in flight dates coupled with a 33% decline in occupancy, underscoring how agricultural practices, when combined with climate warming, can lead to profound demographic shifts in bee communities.

- **Managed versus Wild Pollinators:** Interestingly, while managed honey bee services are predicted to decline (e.g., a 14.5% reduction under the IPCC A1F1 scenario), native bee species play an essential role in buffering these losses. Some studies on watermelon pollination projects show that native pollinators may actually contribute to a net increase of 4.5% in pollination services by 2099. This duality underscores the stabilizing effect of biodiversity and native species presence in agricultural landscapes.

The cumulative impacts of these stressors demand an integrated approach in both research and management, focusing on mitigating combined effects rather than treating each factor in isolation.

## 6. Future Directions and Adaptive Strategies

### 6.1. Research Gaps and Innovations

The current body of research indicates several gaps and opportunities for future investigation:

- **Mechanistic Studies:** More detailed work is needed to unravel the mechanistic links between thermal stress and behavioral adaptations, particularly the underlying physiological processes that drive changes in foraging dynamics and morphometrics.

- **Long-term Monitoring:** Establishing long-term datasets across diverse geographic contexts would allow for better predictions of species distribution shifts and phenological mismatches, crucial for adaptive management.

- **Integrative Modeling:** Future models should integrate multi-stressor effects (e.g., climate warming, pesticides, landscape changes) to provide more holistic risk assessments. Such models can inform both conservation strategies and agroecological practices.

- **Urban Ecology Studies:** Given that some species like Ceratina australensis may actually benefit from urban microclimates, research into urban pollinator dynamics could yield novel insights into mitigating climate change impacts.

### 6.2. Adaptive Management and Policy Recommendations

Given the complexity and heterogeneity of responses among bee species, a one-size-fits-all management approach will be insufficient. Instead, adaptive management practices grounded in localized, species-specific data are recommended:

- **Conservation Prioritization:** Policies should prioritize conservation in regions where models predict dramatic habitat contraction, such as parts of the Amazon and Atlantic Moist Forest. 

- **Support for Native Biodiversity:** Enhancing habitat connectivity and promoting native pollinator diversity can buffer against the inevitable declines in managed species. This may include incentivizing land-use practices that support diversified cropping systems and preserving native wild habitats.

- **Pesticide Regulation:** Revision of pesticide application timings and dosages in conjunction with climatic predictions could reduce the synergistic negative impacts observed in experimental studies (e.g., the combined effects of sulfoxaflor and warm winters on Osmia cornuta).

- **Microclimate Management:** For species affected by extreme thermal shifts in nest microhabitats, engineering solutions such as shading or nest insulation might be explored to stabilize internal nest temperatures, particularly for aboveground nests.

- **Landscape-Level Approaches:** Integrative strategies that combine urban planning, agricultural diversification, and natural habitat restoration can create more resilient landscapes. These landscapes not only buffer climate impacts but also support pollination services critical for food production.

## 7. Concluding Remarks

Climate change is reshaping the ecological and physiological landscape for bees, with profound implications for pollination services, food security, and ecosystem health. The reviewed studies elucidate the complexities underlying bee responses—from thermoregulation and foraging dynamics to morphological adaptations and species-specific phenological shifts. Regional disparities further complicate the picture, requiring bespoke conservation approaches.

A key takeaway from this review is the critical role of native bee diversity. In the face of declining managed honey bee services, native species offer a potential buffer, contributing to overall pollination stability even under severe climate scenarios. To harness this potential, adaptive management practices, informed by integrative and mechanistic research, are paramount.

Moving forward, fostering synergistic collaborations between climate scientists, entomologists, agronomists, and urban planners can lead to innovative solutions that mitigate the multifactorial risks posed by climate change. Embracing both technological advancements (such as real-time microclimate monitoring) and traditional ecological knowledge will be essential to safeguard these indispensable pollinators for future generations.
