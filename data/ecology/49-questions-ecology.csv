The direction of this effect depends on the grasslands ' resource availability. According to the intermediate disturbance and stress hypothesis, medium levels of management should support the highest biodiversity levels, as both competition for nutrients and light are in their best balance. So highly fertilized and cut grasslands should improve in their biodiversity die to extensification, while in abandoned grasslands increasing management to intermediate levels should be Most beneficial. Nutrient retention in soils however can lead to slow effects of extensification on highly managed and thus cut and fertilized grasslands. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
