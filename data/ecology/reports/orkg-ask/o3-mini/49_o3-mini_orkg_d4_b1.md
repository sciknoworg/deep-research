# Final Report on the Causes of Insect Decline in Europe

This report synthesizes current research and multiple lines of evidence regarding the causes of insect decline across Europe. Drawing on a wide range of studies – from long‐term monitoring to advanced simulation models – the report unpacks the intertwined roles of anthropogenic drivers (such as intensified land use, pesticide application, and urbanization) and natural processes (including climate variability and disease dynamics). The evidence is explored across scales, spanning local microhabitat modifications to landscape-level connectivity, and incorporates spatial analyses, modelling studies, and field observations. Below, we present an integrated narrative that touches on multiple hierarchical levels, emphasizing multi-scale environmental interactions, dispersal dynamics, trophic structures, and the importance of both contemporary and historical datasets.

## 1. Introduction and Context

The widespread reports of insect decline in Europe have generated significant scientific and policy attention. Given that insects form the backbone of many terrestrial ecosystems—ensuring pollination, nutrient cycling, and serving as key trophic components—disentangling the roles of anthropogenic versus natural factors becomes paramount. The decline cannot be attributed to a single cause, and recent studies have provided increasingly sophisticated tools and methodologies (such as hierarchical partitioning and space-for-time substitutions) to delineate these complex drivers.

Two broad categories underlie the current understanding:

- **Anthropogenic Factors:** Intensive agriculture (with its associated pesticide applications and land-use changes), urban expansion, systematic forest management, and pollution are clearly documented to reduce insect biomass, species richness, and alter community compositions.
- **Natural Factors:** Climate variability, extreme weather events, natural microclimatic fluctuations, and disease pressures also affect insect populations but tend to interact with anthropogenic factors, magnifying impacts in specific regions and taxonomic groups.

In providing a comprehensive picture of the underlying causes, this report draws heavily on studies conducted over various spatial and temporal scales, highlighting the interplay between localized stressors and broader landscape-scale influences.

## 2. Multi-Scale Interactions and Hierarchical Drivers

### 2.1. Local Scale Dynamics

Recent investigations have illuminated how microhabitat factors are crucial in shaping insect community compositions. Hierarchical partitioning techniques (e.g., partial canonical correspondence analyses) have revealed that local patch and plot scales are direct drivers in determining parameters such as body size distributions and trophic guild structures. Detailed case studies across European biogeographic regions emphasize that:

- **Microclimatic Effects:** Agroecosystems often experience warm and dry conditions that differ significantly from forested or semi-natural areas. Insects adapted to these micro-environments (as seen with certain butterflies and saproxylic beetles) have a higher probability of success under altered thermal and moisture regimes.
- **Habitat Heterogeneity:** The fine-scale variations in moisture and temperature fundamentally govern realized niche breadths for many species. Studies using GBIF occurrence data underpin that insects favoring warmer, drier niches are more successful in agricultural landscapes, differing notably from their forest-associated counterparts.

### 2.2. Landscape and Regional Scale Effects

Beyond the local scale, landscape-level factors—chiefly connectivity and the proximity of habitat patches—play indirect, yet pivotal, roles in influencing insect dispersal and community composition:

- **Landscape Connectivity:** Large-scale studies (including the BiodivAgriM project spanning 24 landscapes in 7 European countries) underscore that interconnected landscapes offer microhabitat continuity and mitigate the fragmentation effects imposed by intensive land use. These patterns are crucial when considering intraspecific niche variations and range expansions under climate change.
- **Biogeographic Differentiation:** The impacts of both natural and anthropogenic drivers vary by region. In Central and Western Europe, long-term studies have demonstrated that groups such as Carabidae and Lepidoptera have seen steep declines—sometimes exceeding a 40% reduction in biomass—correlated with urbanization and agricultural intensification.

By integrating spatial analyses (through methods such as space-for-time substitutions) that leverage high-resolution datasets, researchers have been able to statistically disentangle local from landscape-level effects. This has allowed for a more nuanced understanding of how specific environmental stressors, such as chemical/light pollution or mowing schedules, vary in their impact across different regions and insect guilds.

## 3. The Role of Climate Change and Extreme Events

### 3.1. Temperature Extremes and Climate Variability

Climate change presents one of the most formidable natural stressors that compound anthropogenic influences. Several key insights include:

- **Temperature-driven Trophic Restructuring:** Rising temperatures have initiated significant shifts in trophic interactions. Extreme heat events trigger outbreak–breakdown cycles that reconfigure food web structures. Insect communities, particularly in terrestrial ecosystems, often display unpredictable cycle patterns that challenge traditional management and conservation strategies.
- **Range Shifts and Dispersal Adaptations:** Empirical evidence shows that 96% of expanding Lepidoptera species have shifted poleward since 1975, and higher trophic insects, such as Leptopilina boulardi, have experienced northward range shifts of up to 90 km per decade. These shifts are directly linked to increasing average temperature anomalies (with recorded increases up to +4°C in spring), underlining climate warming as a primary driver.

### 3.2. Modelling Insect Responses Under Changing Climates

Hybrid modelling approaches that incorporate both dispersal mechanisms and microclimatic data are shedding new light on future trajectories of insect populations:

- **Dispersal Modelling:** The HiLEG model, applied to the large marsh grasshopper in North Germany, is particularly illustrative. Simulated on high-resolution (250×250 m) grids, it indicates that even amidst strong management constraints (e.g., early-year mowing), dispersal reserves population stability over 60-year spans. Such models underscore the adaptive potential of insects but also highlight that dispersal capacity is not uniform across species or landscapes.
- **Niche Variation and Predictive Uncertainty:** Emerging modelling frameworks that spatially partition species ranges based on climate data (as seen in studies on European butterflies) now quantify uncertainties in forecasting future species distributions under climate change. These novel approaches allow for the anticipation of range shifts and adaptation patterns by effectively integrating intraspecific niche variability.

## 4. Anthropogenic Land-Use Pressures and Management Practices

### 4.1. Impacts of Intensive Land Use

Human-driven landscape alterations remain the most direct and measurable impacts on insect populations in Europe. Empirical data show:

- **Documented Declines in Biomass and Richness:** Monitoring studies in both urban and agricultural settings reveal steep declines—up to 42% reductions in urban biomass and 29% overall losses in species richness (with threatened species showing even steeper declines, around 56% in semi‐natural compared to agricultural areas). These trends provide compelling evidence linking anthropogenic activities to biodiversity loss.
- **Multiple Stressor Interactions:** Intensified agriculture and urbanization are accompanied by synergistic stressors, such as pesticide infiltrations, habitat fragmentation, and light or chemical pollution. Comparative spatial analyses (like those using space-for-time substitution techniques) confirm that land-use intensity and decreased landscape connectivity are central determinants in altering local insect community compositions.

### 4.2. The Consequences of Managed and Unmanaged Landscapes

Differences between managed (e.g., urban or agricultural) and semi-natural or forested landscapes illuminate key adaptive responses:

- **Compensation Effects:** There is some evidence of compensation in particular groups (e.g., saproxylic beetles) where certain local conditions buffer against loss. However, such compensatory dynamics are spatially dependent and vary with the degree of management intervention and microclimate conditions.
- **Trade-offs in Land-Use:** Urban zones experience compounded pressures not only due to direct changes (e.g., habitat destruction) but also through indirect effects mediated by urban heat islands and altered hydrological regimes. These factors often exacerbate declines observed in surrounding semi-natural habitats, where connectivity may already be compromised by human activities.

## 5. Integrative Perspectives and Future Research Directions

### 5.1. Multidisciplinary and Hierarchical Approaches

A recurrent theme across recent studies is the need for multidisciplinary methodologies that integrate both climatic and land-use factors. Projects such as those using hierarchical partitioning across multiple European landscapes have underscored the following points:

- **Holistic Modelling:** Incorporating dispersal dynamics, microclimatic variability, and landscape connectivity into one coherent modelling framework is emerging as best practice in predicting future population trends. The detail offered by high-resolution spatial datasets enhances our understanding of both immediate and longer-term responses in insect populations to combined stressors.
- **Temporal Trends and Long-Term Monitoring:** There is an acute need for continued long-term studies. Data spanning at least 6 years (as documented for groups like Carabidae and Lepidoptera) are invaluable for distinguishing short-term anomalies from sustained population trends. Future research must bridge the gap between these temporal datasets and predictive climate models.

### 5.2. Policy and Management Implications

The integration of diverse research findings has direct implications for conservation practice and policy formulation:

- **Landscape Management Strategies:** Enhancing habitat connectivity, promoting land-use practices that mitigate fragmentation, and protecting semi-natural areas emerge as critical strategies. Corridors that facilitate dispersal can buffer against extreme climatic events, aiding overall ecosystem resilience.
- **Adaptive Agricultural Practices:** The dual pressures of climate change and intensive agriculture call for adaptive management practices that account for local microclimatic conditions. Dynamic management strategies, such as modifying mowing schedules or employing targeted pesticide applications, could ameliorate some negative impacts.
- **Informed Urban Planning:** Given the stark differences in insect biomass and diversity between urban and semi-natural settings, urban planning should integrate green spaces that maintain and enhance local biodiversity. This includes the preservation of remnant habitats and the incorporation of green corridors within city landscapes.

### 5.3. Emerging Frontiers and Underexplored Mechanisms

Several novel research directions and contrarian perspectives merit attention:

- **Intraspecific Adaptation Mechanisms:** Further research into the genetic and physiological mechanisms enabling insects to adapt to microclimatic variability could inform conservation strategies. Detailed studies on niche partitioning are starting points for understanding such adaptive mechanisms.
- **Role of Biotic Interactions:** The alteration of trophic interactions under climate change—especially the dynamic interplay between predators, pests, and ecosystem service providers—requires deeper investigation. This includes focusing on the unexpected outbreak–breakdown cycles that may result from temperature extremes.
- **Interdisciplinary Data Integration:** The potential of integrating remote sensing data, citizen science observations, and high-resolution climate proxies could provide more granular insights into insect community dynamics. There is considerable scope for leveraging machine learning and novel statistical methods to predict patterns over broader spatial and temporal scales.

## 6. Conclusion

The decline of insect populations across Europe is a multifaceted issue that arises from the interplay between anthropogenic activities and natural climatic variations. By synthesizing evidence from hierarchical spatial analyses, simulation models, and long-term monitoring studies, this report shows that:

- **Local and Landscape Scales Are Equally Important:** While local conditions directly shape community composition and physiological capacities, larger-scale landscape connectivity and heterogeneity exert an indirect, yet powerful, influence on dispersal and long-term survivability.
- **Synergy Between Climate and Land-Use:** The combined effects of climate change and intensified land use amplify the decline of insect populations. The evidence points to accelerating range shifts, altered trophic dynamics, and considerable ecological trade-offs that must be recognized in conservation practices.
- **Adaptive and Integrated Management is Crucial:** Future conservation efforts should employ adaptive agricultural practices, enhance habitat connectivity, and adopt multidisciplinary methodologies. This is vital for mitigating the adverse effects of environmental stressors and ensuring ecosystem resilience.

In summary, addressing insect decline in Europe requires a nuanced understanding of both direct anthropogenic pressures and the modifying influence of climate variability. Further research that simultaneously tackles these factors at multiple scales will be key to developing effective, forward-looking conservation strategies.
