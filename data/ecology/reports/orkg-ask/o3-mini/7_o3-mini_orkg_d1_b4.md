## 1. Introduction

Understanding the realistic range of pesticide exposures for bees is imperative, not only because of the ecological importance of these pollinators but also due to growing concerns over declining bee populations. This report synthesizes previous research on dose ranges applied in laboratory and field experiments with bees. In doing so, we elucidate the need to balance between field-realistic exposure regimes and controlled conditions enabling clear dose-response relationships. Specific attention is given to the following aspects:

- **Species-specific sensitivity:** Different bee species (e.g., Apis mellifera, Megachile rotundata, Osmia bicornis) exhibit widely varying susceptibilities to pesticides, necessitating tailored dosing.
- **Methodological calibration:** Calibration of application methods, such as Potter-type towers, and analytical techniques (UHPLC-DAD, LC–MS/MS) helps ensure that the dose delivered correlates with biological outcomes.
- **Exposure scenarios:** Distinguishing between acute high-concentration exposures and chronic low-dose exposures is essential for understanding the full range of pesticide impacts.
- **Sublethal endpoints:** Behavioral, physiological, and reproductive endpoints often reveal impacts at doses far below those causing mortality, as demonstrated by modified protocols and OMICs investigations.

The following sections detail these aspects systematically.

## 2. Species-specific Sensitivity and Dose Considerations

### 2.1 Comparative Species Data

Recent research underscores enhancing concerns regarding inter-species differences in pesticide sensitivity. For example, while the commonly studied Apis mellifera shows medium sensitivity at doses used in many experiments, studies on Megachile rotundata revealed 100% mortality within 48 hours when exposed to a field-realistic dose of 7.5 g a.s./ha of lambda-cyhalothrin. Meta-analyses extend these findings by showing that nearly half (9 of 19) of the evaluated bee species exhibit heightened sensitivity compared to Apis mellifera. These results indicate that using honey bees as the default model species may underestimate the risk posed to wild bee assemblages.

### 2.2 Implications for Dose Selection

Given the pronounced species-specific responses:

- **Dose Range Definition:** Experimentally realistic pesticide ranges should consider both a median environmental dose (e.g., 20 nM for neonicotinoids) and a high environmental dose (e.g., 80 nM) for chronic exposures as well as sublethal doses for acute exposures (e.g., clothianidin at 2.18 ng/bee, dinotefuran at 7.5 ng/bee at approximately 1/10th of LD50 values).
- **Species Diversification:** Experimental designs must include multiple bee species or exercise caution in extrapolating honey bee results to other species, especially solitary bees such as Osmia bicornis and Megachile species.

## 3. Methodological Advances in Dose Calibration and Delivery

### 3.1 Potter-type Tower and Surface Area Considerations

A pragmatic methodology using a Potter-type tower was implemented for Apis mellifera, yielding an apparent exposure surface area measurement of 1.05 cm² per bee. This measure was validated against physical exposure surface area determined via 3D X-tomography (3.27 cm² per bee). This calibration ensures that the calculated toxic doses align with European testing protocols and provides confidence in the repeatability and reliability of lab-based dosing regimes.

### 3.2 Analytical Methods

The detection of ultratrace levels of chemicals is crucial in pesticide experiments. Analytical techniques such as UHPLC-DAD and LC–MS/MS have been refined to detect neonicotinoids down to the nanogram-per-bee level. These levels are critical for investigations such as:

- **Colony loss studies:** Identification of trace residues that might precipitate long-term health declines in bee populations.
- **Field-realistic monitoring:** Confirming that environmental residue levels correlate with those used in laboratory experiments.

### 3.3 Integrative Modeling Approaches

Integrated toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic models, like BeeGUTS, combine acute and chronic exposure data to build a comprehensive framework. These models have been validated across 17 data sets and allow for time-dependent interpretations of exposure effects. The integration of both acute (96-hour or single-point tests) and chronic data ensures that risk assessments can accommodate delayed and cumulative effects that might be overlooked in single-time-point studies.

## 4. Exposure Scenarios: Acute vs. Chronic Testing

### 4.1 Acute Exposure Events

For experiments simulating acute exposure events, doses are often delivered at sublethal levels that are proximate to one-tenth of the LD50. Such dosing allows researchers to observe immediate, though non-lethal, sublethal biomarkers. For example:

- **Neonicotinoids:** Sublethal exposures at doses such as 2.18 ng/bee for clothianidin and 7.5 ng/bee for dinotefuran.
- **Pyrethroids:** Experiments with pyrethroids (e.g., at 32.5 ng/bee representing 1/4 of LD50) have disclosed impaired homing performance, indicating significant behavioral impacts.

Acute studies are critical for immediate metrics like homing flight accuracy, conditioned proboscis extension, and short-term mortality. However, they might miss delayed or cumulative effects present in chronic exposure scenarios.

### 4.2 Chronic Exposure Regimes

Chronic exposure studies assess the effects of persistent, low-level pesticide exposure, which are more reflective of real-world environmental conditions. Key points include:

- **Dose Ranges:** Utilization of nanomolar concentrations (e.g., 20 nM to 80 nM for neonicotinoids) over extended durations to represent environmental residue levels.
- **Sublethal and Delayed Effects:** Chronic studies have demonstrated that endpoints such as immune response indicators (altered prophenoloxidase and glucose oxidase activities) and reproductive parameters (e.g., fecundity in bumble bees) are highly sensitive to long term low dose exposure.
- **Dynamic Energy Budget Models:** Extended exposure durations (e.g., up to 240 hours or beyond) have revealed changes in LC50 by orders of magnitude compared to acute exposure durations. For instance, comparisons like the 27-fold variation of LC50 from 48 to 720 hours (illustrated in cadmium exposures) emphasize that chronic effects require separate regulatory consideration.

## 5. Endpoint Selection and Behavioral Analysis

### 5.1 Mortality vs. Sublethal Endpoints

Traditional pesticide risk assessments prioritize mortality outcomes. However, our synthesis of research indicates that sublethal endpoints often provide more sensitive early warnings of pesticide impacts. In honey bees, biomarkers such as impaired foraging behavior (homing and waggle dance decoding) and disrupted conditioned responses can be registered at lower doses than those producing outright mortality.

### 5.2 Specialized Behavioral and Physiological Assays

Different endpoints can be tailored depending on the pesticide class and the bee species under study:

- **Honey Bees (Apis mellifera):** Behavioral assays including mobility tests, foraging efficiency, and homing performance are crucial. The use of modified approaches such as conditioned proboscis extension further elucidates subtle neurophysiological changes.
- **Bumble Bees:** Reproductive and fecundity endpoints are particularly sensitive, necessitating metrics that track queen performance and colony establishment over time.
- **Solitary Bees (e.g., Osmia bicornis):** Integration of proteomic analyses and OMICs approaches provides insights into biochemical pathways affected by pesticide exposure. For example, experiments involving acetamiprid in Careo sticks formulations have revealed early biochemical changes aligning with EFSA regulatory insights.

### 5.3 Implications for Future Experimental Design

To capture both immediate and long-term impacts, experimental designs should (a) incorporate multiple endpoints (mortality, behavior, physiology, reproduction), (b) adopt a species-specific approach by validating doses against known sensitivity thresholds, and (c) implement integrative models that explore temporal dynamics of exposure responses.

## 6. Pesticide Classes and Formulations

Experiments differ based on the specific pesticide classes under evaluation. Two major groups under active investigation are:

### 6.1 Neonicotinoids

Neonicotinoids are commonly studied due to their persistence and systemic properties. Key experimental insights include:

- **Dose Ranges:** Acute experiments use sublethal nanogram-per-bee levels, while chronic studies rely on nanomolar concentrations. Field-realistic exposures are often modeled at 20-80 nM, reflecting median and high environmental conditions.
- **Analytical Sensitivity:** Advances in UHPLC-DAD and LC-MS/MS allow for sensitive detection, which is critical in identifying ultratrace residues in individual bees.

### 6.2 Other Classes: Pyrethroids and Organophosphates

Research comparing pyrethroids and organophosphates highlights notable differences:

- **Pyrethroids:** At doses around 32.5 ng/bee (approx. 1/4 of the LD50), pyrethroids have been shown to cause sublethal behavioral impairments, such as reduced homing performance.
- **Organophosphates:** At comparable sublethal dosing levels, organophosphates did not consistently elicit statistically significant behavioral changes. This disparity necessitates a re-examination of traditional hazard quotients which are based primarily on LD50 values expressed in empirical metrics (bees/ha).

The choice of pesticide class and formulation will inevitably guide the selection of endpoints and dose ranges, emphasizing the need for a tailored experimental design.

## 7. Advanced Modeling and Future Directions

### 7.1 Integrative Toxicokinetic-Toxicodynamic Models

The development and validation of models such as BeeGUTS have significantly advanced our understanding of pesticide impacts on bees. By integrating both acute and chronic data, these models can predict time-dependent toxicity and reveal non-linear dose-response relationships. Future experiments should consider:

- **Dynamic Modeling Approaches:** Incorporate dynamic energy budget and TKTD frameworks to better predict cumulative effects of pesticide exposure over extended periods.
- **Cross-species Model Calibration:** Utilize data from multiple bee species to refine model sensitivity, ensuring that the full spectrum of bee health parameters is captured in the risk assessment process.

### 7.2 Rethinking Regulatory Protocols

Traditional hazard quotient methods—using field rates relative to bee LD50 values—are increasingly viewed as limited. Future regulatory protocols might adopt more refined metrics that combine detailed dose-response curves with mechanistic insights from omics assays and integrative models. This shift would drive more accurate risk predictions and facilitate safer pesticide registration protocols.

### 7.3 Implementing Field-realistic Test Durations

Extended exposure protocols (e.g., 240 hours or longer) demonstrate that chronic exposures can produce significantly different toxicity profiles compared to traditional acute tests. Future experiments should be designed to include:

- **Long-term Monitoring:** Continuous tracking of sublethal endpoints, such as changes in immune response and reproductive metrics over weeks or months.
- **Hybrid Exposure Scenarios:** Combining acute challenge tests with chronic exposure regimens to identify threshold effects and latent toxicity phenomena.

## 8. Conclusions

This report has outlined a comprehensive framework for determining realistic pesticide ranges in bee experiments. Key conclusions include:

1. **Species-specific Sensitivity:** Experimental designs must account for inter-species differences in pesticide sensitivity. Using multiple species or adjusting doses based on sensitivity thresholds is critical.

2. **Method Calibration and Accurate Dosing:** The validation of spray methodologies (e.g., Potter-type tower with cross-validation by X-tomography) and the development of sensitive analytical techniques (e.g., UHPLC-DAD, LC-MS/MS) ensure that toxic doses are matched with precise exposure levels.

3. **Endpoint Diversification:** While mortality remains a critical endpoint, sublethal effects (behavioral changes, physiological disruptions, reproductive alterations) often offer earlier and more sensitive indicators of pesticide impact.

4. **Integrated Models for Holistic Assessment:** Combining acute and chronic exposure data with advanced modeling approaches (BeeGUTS, dynamic energy budget models) provides a more complete picture of pesticide toxicity over time.

5. **Regulatory and Field Realism:** The limitations of traditional hazard quotient models underscore the importance of innovating regulatory testing protocols, particularly toward longer exposure durations and integrated omics approaches.

Future research should explore hybrid dosing regimens that bridge acute and chronic exposures, incorporate a greater spectrum of bee species for ecological relevance, and further develop models that account for cumulative and delayed pesticide effects. These advances will ultimately improve environmental risk assessments and guide safer pesticide usage, ensuring the continued health and survival of these ecologically essential pollinators.
