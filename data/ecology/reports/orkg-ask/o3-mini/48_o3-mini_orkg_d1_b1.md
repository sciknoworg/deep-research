# Comparative Efficacy of Mowing versus Grazing in Restoring Plant Diversity

This report investigates under what conditions mowing can be more efficient than grazing in the restoration of plant diversity. The analysis is informed by recent meta-analyses, long‐term field trials, and ecosystem-specific studies across Europe. In particular, both sub-Mediterranean ecosystems—such as those in the central Apennines—and temperate regions (e.g., southern Sweden) are considered. The objective is to identify the circumstances and mechanisms by which mowing outperforms grazing with respect to restoring plant community structure, maintaining species richness, and enhancing soil health over both short- and long-term time scales.

## 1. Introduction

Restoration ecology often involves interventionist strategies to manage overgrown, invasive, or structurally homogeneous plant communities. The central management techniques include mowing and grazing—each with distinct implications in terms of plant diversity, ecosystem multifunctionality, and cost efficiency. While grazing introduces animal-plant interactions that can lead to patchy nutrient addition and direct disturbance, mowing is a mechanical intervention that offers a higher degree of control over cutting height and timing. Identifying the precise contexts in which mowing is more efficient than grazing is therefore critical for devising optimal management strategies, especially in ecosystems experiencing rapid species turnover or invasive species pressure.

## 2. Mechanisms and Underlying Processes

### 2.1. Influence on Plant Community Structure

The plant community’s response to management is highly dependent on the management method. Mowing, through its uniform and predictable cutting, can reduce the competitive dominance of aggressive species (e.g., invasive grasses) and thus allow less competitive, often native, species to establish and thrive. Studies in sub-Mediterranean contexts—specifically the central Apennines—highlight that mowing is effective at controlling invasive species like *Brachypodium rupestre*, ultimately restoring plant community structure.

In contrast, grazing introduces spatial variability where animals select certain species over others, potentially leading to heterogeneity that is beneficial for some ecosystems yet may inadvertently favor competitive species in others.

### 2.2. Soil Health and Ecosystem Multifunctionality

Both mowing and grazing impact soil properties. Mowing, especially when applied at regular intervals, maintains a paralleled and uniform stimulus on the soil surface. This can lead to moderated nutrient cycling and improved soil structure in the long term. Recent meta-analyses have shown that, particularly in areas prone to invasive species pressure or where soil health is compromised, mowing helps in reestablishing soil microbial communities and nutrient profiles over decadal time scales.

Grazing, particularly when intensive, can compact soil and lead to uneven distribution of nutrients due to the deposition of animal waste. This variability in soil health might detract from the overall restoration efficiency when uniform recovery is the goal.

## 3. Ecosystem-Specific Considerations

### 3.1. Sub-Mediterranean Contexts

In regions such as the central Apennines, invasive species represent a major challenge to native biodiversity. Meta-analyses suggest that mowing under these conditions can be more effective than grazing by:

- **Controlling Invasive Species:** Regular mowing mitigates the competitive pressure from invasive species, reducing their ability to dominate the ecosystem.
- **Restoring Soil Health:** The uniform removal of biomass promotes the gradual improvement of soil biological activity, which is essential for long-term ecosystem functionality.

Thus, in sub-Mediterranean or similarly stressed ecosystems, the controlled nature of mowing provides an avenue for restoring both vegetation structure and underlying ecosystem processes.

### 3.2. Temperate Grasslands and Scandinavian Landscapes

Field trials conducted in southern Sweden and other parts of Europe have documented the benefits of annual mowing regimes over long periods (8–14 years). Key findings include:

- **Species Richness:** Annual mowing tends to maintain higher species richness compared to reduced mowing regimes or low-intensity grazing. This is likely due to the predictable disturbance that prevents the proliferation of a few dominant species.
- **Conservation Indicators:** Indicators such as ground layer composition, seed bank diversity, and soil biota levels have been observed at higher levels under regular mowing regimes.

However, it is important to note that the magnitude of these differences is modest and can be highly habitat-specific. In productive semi-natural grasslands, for instance, slightly more frequent mowing (annually or twice a year) may enhance ecosystem multifunctionality, whereas less productive habitats might benefit from a cost-efficient, reduced frequency mowing approach.

## 4. Time Scales and Restoration Outcomes

### 4.1. Short-term Versus Long-term Dynamics

Restoration outcomes must be viewed on varying time scales:

- **Short-term Recovery:** In the initial years following intervention, mowing can rapidly reduce biomass, level competitive disparities, and create openings for native species. Such prompt actions are critical in ecosystems where invasive species are rapidly encroaching.
- **Long-term Ecosystem Stability:** Studies indicate that over decadal scales (8–14 years), the cumulative benefits of mowing—such as maintained species richness and improved soil health—result in a more stable, resilient ecosystem. These long-term benefits are particularly pronounced in ecosystems where a consistent stimulus is needed to counteract the effects of pasture degradation or invasive species dominance.

### 4.2. Metrics of Efficiency

Efficiency in the context of restoration is multi-dimensional. The studies considered here evaluate efficiency along several metrics:

- **Rate of Plant Diversity Increase:** Mowing has been shown to initiate a rapid initial burst in plant diversity, especially in systems burdened by invasive species.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Mowing regimens, particularly when optimally timed and frequency-adjusted, can be more cost-effective in less productive sites or where labor and mechanization are readily available. In contrast, grazing may require ongoing monitoring and adjustments based on animal behavior and density.
- **Impacts on Soil Health:** The uniform mechanical disruption from mowing supports a predictable pattern of soil recovery and microbial rebound over time, contributing to long-term ecosystem stability.

A careful evaluation of these metrics in relation to site-specific conditions is essential to determine the optimal management strategy.

## 5. Context-Dependent Recommendations and Strategic Implications

Based on the learnings from the current body of research, the following recommendations emerge for practitioners engaged in ecosystem restoration:

### 5.1. Selecting the Appropriate Ecosystem Management Strategy

- **For Sub-Mediterranean Ecosystems:** In regions such as the central Apennines, where invasives like *Brachypodium rupestre* are a significant threat, mowing is preferentially suitable. The predictable disturbance regime introduced by mowing not only curbs the invasive growth but also facilitates the reestablishment of native species and the recovery of soil functions.

- **For Temperate Grasslands:** In more temperate regions such as those in southern Sweden, an annual mowing regime has been documented to preserve species richness and overall ecosystem function more effectively over many years. In highly productive grasslands, increasing the frequency (to twice a year) may enhance results, although this should be carefully balanced against cost considerations.

- **For Less Productive Sites:** Reduced-frequency mowing might provide a cost-efficient option while still conferring benefits in terms of species regeneration and soil health. A “one-size-fits-all” approach is inappropriate; managers should calibrate mowing frequency based on site-specific productivity and restoration objectives.

### 5.2. Complementing Management with Monitoring and Adaptive Strategies

An important element that emerged from the integration of these research findings is the necessity for an adaptive management framework. Recommendations include:

- **Integrated Monitoring:** Continuous assessment of soil health, plant diversity metrics, and invasion pressure should inform the adaptive management process. The use of remote sensing, precision agriculture tools, and in situ biodiversity assessments can improve the precision of these evaluations.

- **Flexible Scheduling:** Depending on observed outcomes, management schedules (mowing frequency, timing, and spatial extent) should be dynamically adjusted. This may involve varying mowing frequency seasonally or temporarily switching to grazing in response to unexpected ecological disturbances.

- **Hybrid Approaches:** In some ecosystems, a hybrid management that combines both grazing and mowing might capitalize on the strengths of each method. For example, initial mowing to reduce invasive pressure can be followed by controlled grazing to maintain heterogeneity and provide nutrient cycling benefits.

## 6. Future Research Directions and Concluding Thoughts

### 6.1. Expanding the Research Horizon

While the current research provides several insights, it also highlights areas for further investigation:

- **Mechanistic Understanding:** Future studies should delve deeper into the mechanistic underpinnings of how mowing alters soil microbiomes and nutrient cycling relative to grazing. Understanding these processes at a molecular level could lead to fine-tuning management practices for even better outcomes.

- **Longer-Term Studies:** Extending long-term field trials beyond 14 years would help clarify whether the early benefits of mowing maintain their advantage or if grazing can eventually catch up in certain contexts.

- **Integration with Climate Change Scenarios:** Given that climate change is altering species interactions and ecosystem productivity, future comparisons of mowing and grazing should consider climate resilience. Predictive models that incorporate shifting rainfall patterns, temperature regimes, and extreme weather events will be vital.

### 6.2. Concluding Synthesis

In summary, mowing can be more efficient than grazing in restoring plant diversity under a number of conditions, notably when:

- The target ecosystem is facing invasive species pressures, as demonstrated in sub-Mediterranean regions (e.g., the central Apennines).
- The management goal is long-term ecosystem stability and soil health, with benefits that accrue over 8–14 years or more.
- A well-timed and frequency-adjusted mowing regime can enhance species richness and conservation indicators better than reduced mowing or low-intensity grazing in certain ecosystems.

Ultimately, the choice between mowing and grazing should be informed by an ecosystem-specific, adaptive management framework that integrates ongoing monitoring and the flexibility to switch or hybridize methods as necessary. By combining these approaches, managers can optimize plant diversity restoration and enhance ecosystem resilience in the face of both ecological and climatic challenges.

This comprehensive review underscores the multifaceted nature of restoration efficiency. While mowing presents several advantages in controlled and predictable intervention contexts, its success is deeply intertwined with the specific ecological, climatic, and economic settings of a given landscape.
