# The Impact of Climate Change on Bees' Overwintering Period: An Integrative Analysis

## Executive Summary

Climate change profoundly alters the biological and ecological parameters fundamental to bee survival and pollination services, with overwintering playing a critical role in the annual life cycles of these essential pollinators. This report synthesizes empirical data, mechanistic models, and observational studies to elucidate how climate warming affects bee overwintering patterns across different species, life history traits, and geographic contexts. We present detailed analyses of physiological impacts, phenological mismatches, spatial migration dynamics, and ensuing consequences for plant–pollinator network structures, examining both direct and indirect effects on bee fitness and ecosystem resilience.

## 1. Introduction

Bees are keystone pollinators influencing both agricultural productivity and natural ecosystems. Their overwintering stage—whether as adults or prepupae—serves as a critical bottleneck in their annual life cycle. Recent experimental manipulations combined with spatially explicit models have spotlighted climate change as a driver of significant shifts in overwintering period dynamics. This report integrates recent learnings, spanning diverse model systems (from solitary and social bees to Arctic bumblebees), to assess how warming temperatures are reshaping overwintering, emergence timing, and subsequent ecological interactions.

## 2. Mechanistic Insights from Empirical Studies

### 2.1 Temperature Effects on Overwintering Stage

Experimental data indicates that the overwintering life stage plays a pivotal role in mediating bees' responses to climate warming. Studies in Montana have compared bees overwintering as adults versus prepupae, revealing:

- **Adult Overwinterers:** They exhibit pronounced phenological mismatches in spring. A resulting delay or temporal desynchronization with floral availability reduces body size and lifespan. This outcome was corroborated by multiple experiments showing significant physiological stress under elevated temperatures.

- **Prepupal Overwinterers:** These bees tend to advance their emergence, often emerging in mid‐summer. While this early emergence may allow them to exploit peak floral resource windows (as demonstrated in studies on Osmia lignaria which link a 30.6% fitness increase with advanced emergence), rapid shifts between winter dormancy and active foraging can also lead to mismatches with the phenology of key plants.

### 2.2 Phenological Mismatches and Network Architecture

Observational data from Great Britain reveals an average advance in wild bee emergence dates of 0.40 ± 0.02 days per year since 1980, with a temperature increase corresponding to a 6.5 ± 0.2-day advancement per 1°C warming. Projections under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios hint at advances of 13.4 and 24.9 days respectively. This direct climatic control of bee phenology has cascading effects:

- **Pollination Windows:** Modified emergence timing can shorten effective pollination periods by as much as 50% under elevated CO2 scenarios.

- **Network Resilience:** Reduced temporal overlap between bee activity and flowering periods alters interaction networks, potentially increasing the vulnerability of both pollinators and plants to coextinctions, as seen in simulated extinctions driven by trait similarity among pollinators.

### 2.3 Overwintering and Dietary Specialization

Mechanistic models and empirical analyses also reveal that reduced temporal overlap in flowering periods forces bees to undergo dietary specialization, especially those species with shorter flight durations. This dietary shift reinforces changes in pollination network structures, as bees become increasingly reliant on a narrower set of resources. Consequently, the resilience of the ecosystem is compromised when climatic shifts further restrict the already limited temporal window for mutualistic interactions.

## 3. Spatial and Temporal Dynamics

### 3.1 Geographic Shifts in Bee Populations

Longitudinal surveys and spatial distribution models document clear northward and elevational shifts in bee populations:

- **British Wild Bees:** Approximately 92% of these species have expanded their climatic envelopes, potentially exposing them to new ecological pressures and altering their overwintering behavior.

- **Bumblebees in the Colorado Rocky Mountains:** These species are moving upward by hundreds of meters. Such elevational shifts are critical as they may lead to mismatches with local flora that do not shift synchronously, increasing risks for pollination disruptions.

### 3.2 Migration Dynamics and RFID-Tag Studies

RFID-based studies conducted on species such as Melipona fasciculata have underscored the importance of both neutral (bee dispersal capabilities, regional commonness) and niche-based traits (flower preferences, habitat context) in dictating spatial migration patterns. Along a 682 km latitudinal gradient, these insights revealed that:

- **Spatial Migration:** The dispersal dynamics are a key factor underpinning how bee populations track suitable climatic and floral resources, thereby influencing the overall connectivity of pollination networks.

- **Transplant Experiments & Citizen Science:** Spatial and temporal transplant experiments, augmented by citizen-science data (e.g., from eBird), highlight critical thresholds in dispersal rates (from 0.08 to 1.26 km/year) that are vital for synchronizing plant–pollinator interactions under climate change.

## 4. Interactions Between Life History Traits and Overwintering Responses

### 4.1 Differential Responses Based on Overwintering Stage

The interplay between life history traits and overwintering strategies is central to understanding climate change impacts:

- **Adult Overwinterers:** As noted, warming conditions lead to reduced body size and lifespan, and stronger phenological mismatches, particularly at the onset of spring. These alterations compromise their fitness and ability to fulfill pollination roles early in the season.

- **Prepupal Overwinterers:** Although these bees advance phenology, which may be adaptive in some contexts, they also run the risk of emerging too early if floral resources have not yet peaked. Experimental studies on solitary bees emphasize that even short mismatches of 3–6 days can result in species-specific declines in reproductive success.

Experimental evidence thus codifies that the overwintering life stage is a critical trait that modulates physiological and ecological responses to climate warming.

### 4.2 Shifts in Dietary and Behavioral Patterns

Emerging research has documented that modified overwintering dynamics lead to increased dietary specialization. For instance, mechanistic models suggest that shortened periods of floral availability compel bees with limited flight durations to focus on fewer plant species, thereby restructuring pollination network architectures. This is especially critical given that trait-based grouping can markedly alter network resilience, as highlighted by the Arctic bumblebee study involving 14 species with 1277 individuals over three seasons.

## 5. Network Implications and Co-extinction Risks

### 5.1 Pollination Network Vulnerability

Integrating species-specific physiological constraints with spatial migration dynamics has revealed profound implications for mutualistic interactions:

- **Adaptive Plasticity & Network Rewirings:** Bees exhibit adaptive plasticity and may develop novel network interactions; however, these adaptive strategies have limitations. The evolution of mutualistic interactions under climate change involves complex dynamics, including two-species Allee thresholds that can buffer, but not fully offset, the disrupted interactions.

- **Co-extinction Cascades:** Simulated extinction based on trait similarity in Arctic bumblebees and flowering plants demonstrated that co-extinction processes can be accelerated under phenological mismatches. Empirical data support that such network rewirings may not fully compensate for the loss of functional redundancy, increasing overall ecosystem vulnerability.

### 5.2 Conservation and Corridor Protection

Mechanistic models incorporating species-specific life history traits forecast that approximately 80% of plant species might be unable to track their current climatic niches under moderate climate change. This emphasizes the urgency for adaptive conservation strategies:

- **Identification and Protection of Habitat Corridors:** Regions such as eastern São Paulo and southern Minas Gerais have been identified as critical by maintaining pollination network connectivity. Protecting these corridors could bolster ecosystem resilience by facilitating the natural migration and range expansion of bee populations, thereby reducing network fragmentation.

- **Integrative Conservation Approaches:** Future research should evaluate combining adaptive management strategies with both ex situ and in situ conservation efforts. This includes identifying microclimatic refugia that can serve as buffers for vulnerable overwintering species.

## 6. Future Research Directions and Policy Implications

Given the breadth of recent findings, several research avenues and policy recommendations emerge:

### 6.1 Improved Modeling and Long-Term Monitoring

- **Enhanced Mechanistic Models:** Future mechanistic models should integrate more detailed species-specific physiological data alongside realistic dispersal kernels. Incorporating high-resolution climate data can improve projections of phenological mismatches and the cascading effects on ecosystem services.

- **Longitudinal Surveys:** Expanded long-term monitoring of bee populations using RFID and citizen-science data will be essential to validate model predictions and refine our understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics in bee life cycles.

### 6.2 Adaptive Management Strategies

- **Targeted Conservation Corridors:** Approaches that identify and protect crucial habitat corridors should become central to conservation strategies. These corridors are vital not only for maintaining connectivity but also for helping bees track shifting climatic envelopes.

- **Local Adaptation and Assisted Migration:** In cases where natural migration rates are insufficient (e.g., due to habitat fragmentation), assisted migration or microclimate buffering techniques (such as managed shading and water management) could mitigate the impacts of premature or delayed emergence.

### 6.3 Policy and Ecosystem Management

- **Integrating Climate Projections into Pollinator Health Programs:** Policy frameworks should explicitly integrate climate change projections when designing pollinator health programs. This will help preemptively adjust agricultural practices and conservation policies to synchronous shifts in bee and plant phenology.

- **Investment in Citizen Science and Data Infrastructure:** Continued investment in data collection platforms such as eBird and expanded RFID tagging networks will be indispensable for real-time monitoring and adaptive management in response to rapid climatic changes.

## 7. Conclusions

The effect of climate change on bees' overwintering period is multi-dimensional, integrating direct physiological stress, nuanced shifts in life history traits, and complex spatial and temporal migration dynamics. Alterations in the overwintering stage—whether through reduced adult survival or advanced prepupal emergence—have profound implications for phenology, pollination network architectures, and ultimately, ecosystem resilience. Empirical and modeling studies converge on the conclusion that these shifts instigate both imminent risks (such as mismatches with flowering periods and reduced body size) and long-term consequences (such as altered network vulnerabilities and coextinction risks).

Proactive conservation strategies, informed by detailed mechanistic insights and robust spatial models, are necessary to counteract these trends. As the climate continues to warm, both immediate mitigation and adaptive management will be key to sustaining the essential pollination services that bees provide.
