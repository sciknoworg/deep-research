## 1. Introduction

Bee pollinators play a pivotal role in ensuring food security, ecosystem functionality, and biodiversity. With the dual challenges of habitat fragmentation, climate change, and pathogen pressures (e.g., Varroa mites), the need for integrated, adaptive management strategies has become essential. In addressing these challenges, best practices in bee conservation have evolved to intersect genomics, land management, and policy frameworks. This report outlines the comprehensive approaches necessary to safeguard pollinator populations both at global and local scales, drawing on evidence spanning decades of research and policy development.

## 2. Contextualizing Global and Regional Policy Frameworks

### 2.1. The Role of International Policies

Modern bee conservation operates within a robust international framework. Guidelines such as the Nagoya Protocol, United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) post-2020 Framework collectively mandate mission-oriented governance and coordinated policy actions. These initiatives encourage:

- **Mission-Oriented Governance:** Aligning research priorities with actionable conservation outcomes.
- **Coordinated Public–Private Partnerships:** Facilitating large-scale and long-term resource mobilization.
- **Transdisciplinary Collaboration:** Bridging academic research particularly in genomics, with concrete conservation management actions on the ground.

### 2.2. Regional Initiatives and Frameworks

Beyond global mandates, regional frameworks such as the International Pollinator Initiative and the IUCN-guided bee Regional Red Lists drive targeted, localized interventions. By addressing regional and local stressors—ranging from invasive species to agricultural intensification—these frameworks ensure that both wild and managed populations are integrated into a cohesive conservation agenda. The emphasis on regional biodiversity aids in maintaining locally adapted genetic diversity while mitigating the homogenizing effects of international bee trade.

## 3. Integrating Genomic Insights with Conservation Practice

### 3.1. Genomic Data and Standardized Protocols

Recent advances in genomics have empowered conservationists to adopt precision-targeted strategies. High-resolution techniques from population genomics, transcriptomics, and gene expression assays are now routinely employed. Key initiatives include:

- **USDA’s Ag100Pest and Earth BioGenome Project:** These programs have been instrumental in establishing international platforms (such as i5K Workspace@NAL and Ag Data Commons) that emphasize adherence to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. Such platforms facilitate cross-border data sharing and provide the analytical backbone for large-scale genomic research.
- **Standardized Workflows:** Integrating genomic data into ecosystem service management requires standardized workflows for genotype-environment associations, providing actionable insights that inform targeted conservation strategies (e.g., assisted migration, population supplementation, and invasive species control).

### 3.2. Case Studies in Genomic Integration

The BEEHOPE and MEDIBEES projects serve as important case studies illustrating how whole-genome sequencing of over 1300 geo-referenced bee colonies across several Mediterranean subspecies has supported the conservation of locally adapted genetic diversity. These studies underscore the necessity of addressing genetic bottlenecks resulting from international trade and highlight innovative approaches to sustainable beekeeping practices.

## 4. Advancements in Land Management and Agricultural Practices

### 4.1. Ecological Intensification and Diversified Farming

Modern conservation strategies now extend to robust land management practices that integrate technological advances with traditional ecological knowledge. Some key recommendations include:

- **Ecological Intensification:** Promoting diversified and resilient agrosystems, particularly through the intensification of diversified farming systems that support a broad spectrum of pollinators beyond managed Apis mellifera.
- **Buffer Zones and Darwinian Beekeeping:** These strategies aim to alleviate pressures from intensive land use by employing buffer zones that facilitate natural pollination processes and adaptive beekeeping practices that mimic natural selection processes.

### 4.2. Strategic Land Use and Habitat Restoration

To counteract habitat fragmentation and loss, conservation practices focus on restoring landscapes with native flora, integrating pollinator corridors, and preserving ecologically significant habitats. The longitudinal bibliometric studies (1987–2016) have emphasized a strategic shift in conservation focus—from specific bioagressors to broader global change factors such as climate change and landscape alterations. The integration of such measures is crucial for promoting long-term ecological resilience.

## 5. Technological Innovations in Bee Conservation

### 5.1. Advanced Genomic and Data Analytics Tools

The deployment of state-of-the-art genomic tools is translating raw data into actionable conservation strategies. Innovations include:

- **Transcriptomics and Gene Expression Assays:** These approaches help identify stress responses in bees under varying climatic and ecological conditions. This information is pivotal for supporting adaptive management measures.
- **Open Data Platforms:** Facilitating the international exchange of genomic data through FAIR-compliant infrastructures and analytical pipelines boosts the scalability of conservation projects like the Earth BioGenome Project.

### 5.2. Integrating Traditional and Modern Practices

Technological investments are not confined solely to genomics. The integration of conventional agricultural practices with innovative technological solutions such as drones for monitoring, remote sensing for habitat mapping, and real-time data analytics for monitoring bee health offers a comprehensive, hybrid approach. These methods can be combined with Darwinian beekeeping practices, widening the toolkit available for conservation managers.

## 6. Stakeholder Engagement and Collaborative Frameworks

### 6.1. Public–Private Partnerships and Transdisciplinary Collaboration

One of the major takeaways from recent research is the indispensable role of multi-sectoral partnerships. By engaging local communities, academia, government agencies, and the private sector, conservation initiatives are better able to address the multi-dimensional challenges faced by bee populations:

- **Integrative Governance:** Aligning international policies with local management practices ensures that conservation efforts are both scalable and adaptive. This involves bridging national policy divides through coordinated governance and sustained stakeholder engagement.
- **Transdisciplinary Research:** Success relies on merging genomic research with real-world land management practices. Teams composed of geneticists, ecologists, data scientists, and policy experts ensure that innovative strategies are contextually relevant and practically implementable, bridging the gap between research and actionable conservation.

### 6.2. Implications for Managed Versus Wild Bee Populations

The integration of conservation practices must address both managed honeybees and wild bee species. While globally managed Apis mellifera colonies have seen an 85% increase since 1961 (notwithstanding high overwinter mortality rates), there is a growing emphasis on diversifying pollinator management. Recommendations now focus on harnessing the potential of approximately 66 additional pollinator species—including bumble bees, solitary bees, stingless bees, and even some pollinator flies—thus ensuring that ecosystem services related to pollination remain resilient amidst changing environmental conditions.
