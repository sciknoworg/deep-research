# Final Report: Can Herbivory Modulate the Effects of Global Change on Plant Communities?

This report synthesizes extensive research on the interactions between herbivory and global change drivers. It integrates multi-scale, multi-trophic studies carried out in diverse ecosystems—from Arctic tundra to temperate grasslands and boreal forests—to understand how herbivore activity modulates plant community structure, ecosystem processes, and feedbacks to climate regulation. The following sections detail the mechanisms, experimental evidence, modeling approaches, and outstanding challenges in this burgeoning field.

## 1. Introduction

Understanding the interplay between herbivory and global change is paramount as ecosystems face multifactorial stressors including climate warming, elevated CO2, nutrient deposition (especially nitrogen), pollution, and land-use change. Recent work has revealed that herbivory not only shapes plant community dynamics but can also modulate ecosystem responses to climatic drivers by affecting nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. This report addresses core questions raised during our inquiry: Which aspects of global change influence herbivory, what types of herbivores (vertebrates vs. invertebrates) and mechanisms (selective feeding, grazing, bioturbation) are most impactful, and how do these effects scale spatially and temporally across ecosystems such as grasslands, tundra, and forests?

## 2. Mechanistic Insights into Herbivory under Global Change

### 2.1. Plant-Herbivore Interactions and Metabolic Shifts

Herbivory drives rapid evolutionary responses and has been shown to induce both constitutive and inducible defense mechanisms in plants. For example, experimental studies with _Plantago lanceolata_ have demonstrated that elevated CO2 can reduce leaf nitrogen content while enhancing defensive metabolites. Nonetheless, interspecific competition – as observed with _Lolium perenne_ – often neutralizes these responses, highlighting the complex interplay between abiotic factors and competition. Multi-omics frameworks, combining RNA sequencing with high-throughput phenotyping, have advanced our understanding of these plant defense signaling pathways from cellular recognition (e.g., calcium and jasmonate signaling) to systemic defense responses. These insights underline the role of phenotypic plasticity and rapid adaptation in shaping trophic interactions when plants confront a suite of global change stressors.

### 2.2. Warming, Elevated CO2, and Moisture Interactions

Experiments manipulating combined climate drivers indicate that interactions among warming, elevated CO2, and altered moisture regimes produce non-additive effects on plant metabolic pathways. In particular, multivariate models sometimes counterintuitively favor larger-bodied herbivores within tritrophic networks, even though warming alone is expected to select for smaller sizes. This highlights the need for factorial designs to understand the complex dynamics among plant growth, herbivore physiology, and nutrient cycling in environments where multiple drivers are in play.

### 2.3. Nutrient Enrichment, Nitrogen Deposition, and Ecosystem Feedbacks

Nitrogen deposition plays a pivotal role in shaping herbivore dynamics. Evidence from both mesocosm and field experiments (e.g., long-term grassland studies) shows that nutrient addition can cause a disproportionate increase in herbivore biomass relative to plants and parasitoids. This imbalance, often resulting in fourfold increases in herbivore populations under synergistic warming and nitrogen addition, may reduce top‐down regulation and intensify pest outbreaks. Furthermore, nitrogen influences fauna through at least ten distinct pathways—ranging from chemical stress to microclimatic changes—though the exact mechanisms in trophic transfer remain incompletely defined. Coupled with advances in integrated mechanistic models (such as those enhanced from the CENTURY framework), these findings underscore how herbivory can modulate the carbon and nitrogen dynamics underlying long-term soil organic carbon sequestration.

## 3. Spatial and Temporal Scales of Herbivory Impacts

### 3.1. Landscape-Scale and Ecosystem-Level Dynamics

Ecosystem stability is largely mediated by the spatial structure and diversity of plant communities. For instance, data from 39 grassland experiments reinforce that higher beta diversity – reflecting increased species turnover over space – stabilizes productivity by promoting asynchronous dynamics. Conversely, both biotic homogenization and nutrient-driven species turnover can destabilize ecosystems. Herbivore exclusion experiments have shown that removing key herbivores decreases spatial asynchrony among communities, leading to diminished gamma stability. Such findings reveal that herbivory interplays with landscape-scale processes such as land-use intensification, forestry practices (e.g., afforestation vs. avoided deforestation), and rewilding initiatives.

### 3.2. Ecosystem Types: Tundra, Grasslands, and Forest Systems

In the Arctic, long-term studies such as the Svalbard mesic tundra trials (2003–2014) indicate that even short bouts of intense herbivory can produce lasting shifts in vegetation structure, including increases in dead biomass and alterations in flowering and reproductive patterns. This has implications for nutrient cycling and climate feedbacks. In boreal and temperate forests, high densities of vertebrate herbivores, particularly white-tailed deer, have been linked to altered understory composition and successional trajectories, thereby influencing both alpha and beta diversity. Broad-scale studies and standardized measurement protocols (e.g., ITEX) have further underscored that herbivory in these ecosystem types is highly contingent on local abiotic factors such as temperature gradients, NDVI-measured productivity, and even coastal proximity.

### 3.3. Temporal Dynamics and Community Turnover

Temporal stability is contingent on both species turnover and asynchronous fluctuations across space. Longitudinal experiments show that nutrient addition can trigger shifts in local communities by promoting species replacement, while herbivore exclusion reduces spatial asynchrony. A notable global experiment across 34 grasslands over five years demonstrated that while fertilizer-driven turnover undermines temporal stability, the removal of herbivores diminishes the buffering effect of spatial asynchrony. This multi-dimensional view compels us to consider both short-term (seasonal) and long-term (decadal) impacts when predicting ecosystem responses under future global change scenarios.

## 4. Trophic Cascades, Multitrophic Interactions, and Top-Down Regulation

### 4.1. Disrupted Food Webs and Cascading Effects

Global change drivers profoundly alter multitrophic interactions. Most notably, studies in grasslands and mesocosms reveal that while elevated temperatures and nitrogen deposition increase herbivore biomass substantially, plant and parasitoid responses are comparatively muted—often leading to cascading trophic effects such as reduced parasitism rates and diminished top‐down regulation. This shift in biomass distributions can undermine the resilience of food webs, paving the way for pest outbreaks and altered nutrient cycling.

### 4.2. Comparative Perspectives: Vertebrate vs. Invertebrate Herbivores

A striking gap in the current literature is the differential study of vertebrate versus invertebrate herbivory. Research has predominantly focused on vertebrate herbivores—studied around seven times more often than invertebrates—with geographic biases toward regions like Northern Fennoscandia. However, nuanced research highlighting invertebrate responses (e.g., reduced parasitism, food‐web restructuring) demonstrates that bottom-up effects are dominant under global change. Understanding these differences is critical; vertebrates and invertebrates have different physiological constraints (e.g., endothermy vs. ectothermy) that may lead to disparate trophic cascade outcomes in response to warming, nitrogen enrichment, and land-use change.

## 5. Methodological Advances and Modeling Approaches

### 5.1. Integrated Data Assimilation and Computational Advances

Recent innovations in Bayesian state-space modeling and high-performance computing have allowed researchers to integrate heterogeneous, real-time environmental datasets. Tools such as EcoPAD v1.0 and platforms like the Ondex integration pipeline have combined sensor network data, remote sensing observations, and inventory datasets to refine predictive models of ecosystem dynamics. These integrative approaches are essential for reconciling experimental data (from controlled mesocosms to landscape-scale surveys) with mechanistic models of carbon and nitrogen cycling.

### 5.2. Omics, High-Throughput Phenotyping, and Standardized Protocols

The advent of genomic-scale methods (e.g., RNA sequencing, DNA metabarcoding) and high-throughput phenotyping initiatives (such as TraitCapture) has transformed our ability to monitor plant defense traits and phenotypic plasticity across ecosystems. Standardized protocols (MIAPPE, Crop Ontology, FAIR principles) have been instrumental in ensuring data interoperability and traceability. Such integration is key to discerning genotype-by-environment interactions and to bridging studies conducted across vastly different spatial scales, from plot-level ITEX experiments to continental-scale remote sensing surveys.

### 5.3. Mechanistic and Empirical Models

Mechanistic models that incorporate empirically derived herbivory functions—often based on long-term field manipulation experiments—have proven effective in elucidating complex interactions among warming, nitrogen deposition, and herbivory. For example, adaptations of the CENTURY framework now include herbivore impacts on carbon and nitrogen dynamics, demonstrating that enhanced herbivory can depress both vegetative and soil carbon storage. Meanwhile, tritrophic food web analyses underscore that multifactorial climate drivers, when considered simultaneously, occasionally lead to counterintuitive predictions such as the favoring of larger herbivores. This highlights both the role of experimental design and the need for adaptive, climate-smart Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies.

## 6. Applications, Land-Use Strategies, and Management Implications

### 6.1. Strategies for Ecosystem Resilience

Research incorporating multi-objective frameworks has shown that ecosystem service indicators—including carbon sequestration, nitrogen retention, evapotranspiration, and biodiversity metrics—can guide land-use decisions that restore natural trophic interactions. For instance, integrated land-use models (e.g., IMAGE, MAgPIE, LPJ-GUESS) reveal that forestry strategies such as afforestation and bioenergy with carbon capture produce markedly different trade-offs. Additionally, empirical land-use planning strategies that employ stand-level mosaic management have been developed to balance carbon storage with biodiversity conservation and water regulation.

### 6.2. Trophic Rewilding and Herbivore Reintroduction

Emerging studies on rewilding and the reintroduction of large herbivores provide evidence for their potential to mitigate climate-driven vegetation changes. Comparative research in regions such as Scandinavia and Alaska suggests that reintroducing native herbivores can restore historical trophic interactions, thereby driving transitions between competing vegetation states (e.g., forest–tundra, grassland–shrub dynamics) and enhancing ecosystem resilience.

### 6.3. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Response Complementarity

Multitrophic analyses point toward opportunities for designing IPM strategies that leverage response complementarity among natural enemies. Research shows that manipulating environmental drivers to enhance particular natural enemy responses (i.e., parasitoids) could re-establish top-down regulation in systems where warming and nutrient enhancements have boosted herbivore biomass. Such approaches underline the integration of ecological, molecular, and remote-sensing data to guide management interventions.

## 7. Outstanding Challenges and Future Directions

Despite significant advances, several crucial knowledge gaps remain:

1. **Disentangling Causal Pathways:** There is a critical need to clarify how changes in plant chemical composition and trophic transfer mechanisms translate into ecosystem-level responses under nitrogen deposition and other chemical stressors.

2. **Scale-Dependent Dynamics:** Future research must further integrate spatial asynchrony, community turnover, and multi-scale analyses to disentangle the relative contributions of local versus landscape-scale processes in mediating stability.

3. **Comparative Studies of Herbivore Types:** A greater focus on invertebrate herbivory is warranted to balance the current vertebrate-centric bias, particularly in diverse global settings.

4. **Integration of Multidisciplinary Datasets:** The continued advancement of standardization protocols and integrative platforms that merge omics, remote sensing, and ecological data is essential to build predictive, mechanistic models capable of reliably forecasting ecosystem responses.

5. **Counterintuitive Outcomes from Multifactorial Drivers:** Observations that multifactorial climate drivers may favor larger-bodied herbivores contrast with traditional expectations and call for refined models that account for potential feedback loops in energy flow and nutrient redistribution.

## 8. Conclusion

Herbivory plays a multifaceted role in modulating the effects of global change on plant communities. Experimental and modeling studies across varied ecosystems underscore that the combined influences of climate warming, elevated CO2, nutrient deposition, and land-use changes produce non-additive, context-dependent impacts. Herbivore-induced shifts in vegetation structure, nutrient cycling, and trophic interactions can have long-term ecosystem consequences, particularly when interacting with regional biodiversity and spatial heterogeneity. Future research efforts must bridge disciplinary divides, fully integrate multi-scale data, and address both the biological and socio-economic dimensions of these complex systems.

Advancing our understanding of these interactions is vital not only for theoretical ecology but also for practical applications in ecosystem management, IPM, and adaptive land-use planning under the accelerating pace of global change.
