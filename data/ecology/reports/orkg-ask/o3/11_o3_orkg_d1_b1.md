# Does Mycorrhizal Inoculation Increase Plant Biomass?  
A Technical Synthesis and Strategic Outlook  
(Compiled 2025-06-04)

## 1. Executive Summary
• **Short answer**: Across the peer-reviewed record, mycorrhizal inoculation generally increases plant biomass, with the magnitude and consistency of the response strongly conditioned by plant functional group, mycorrhizal type, soil fertility (especially P), and time since inoculation.  
• **Effect sizes**:  
  – Field restoration studies (26 studies, 70 comparisons): Hedges g ≈ **1.7** (≈ +80–120 % biomass) and +30 % community richness, compounding over the first 3 yr.  
  – Crop systems (115 studies, 435 experiments): **+34.9 %** mean total biomass; single-species arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) formulations averaged **+41.2 %**.  
  – Facilitation meta-analysis (215 cases): AMF significantly increased above-ground biomass in semi-arid systems; no significant gain from ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) in temperate forests.  
• **Highest responders**: N-fixing woody legumes, C₄ grasses, perennial forbs on P-deficient soils, recently disturbed/restored sites, annual crops paired with host-specific AMF genera (e.g., _Rhizophagus_ for Solanaceae).  
• **Underperformers / non-responders**: High-P soils, intensively fertilised row crops with resident AMF, late-successional EMF-dominated forests, non-host brassicas, mycorrhizal “cheater” plant lineages.  
• **Knowledge gaps**: Long-term (>10 yr) field trajectories, cost-effectiveness in high-input systems, interactions with other microbiome members, and trait-based matching tools.

## 2. Evidence Base in Detail
### 2.1 Field Restoration Meta-analysis (26 studies; 70 comparisons)
• Hedges g ≈ 1.7 equates to roughly doubling of biomass vs. non-inoculated controls.  
• Richness ↑ 30 %, promoting successional trajectories and soil stabilization.  
• Strongest effects: N-fixing shrubs/trees (_Acacia_, _Prosopis_), C₄ grasses (_Andropogon_, _Panicum_), inoculated into low-P, alkaline or post-mining substrates.  
• Temporal dynamics: Linear biomass gain Yr 0–1, saturating at Yr 3; little evidence beyond Yr 5.

### 2.2 Crop‐Focused Systematic Review (115 studies; 435 experiments)
• Overall biomass gain: **+34.9 % (95 % CI ±6.5 %)**.  
• Single-species inocula outperform multispecies mixes (41.2 % vs. 29.5 %), refuting the assumption that diversity per se guarantees function.  
• Host × AMF specificity: e.g. _Funneliformis_ with Poaceae, _Rhizophagus_ with Solanaceae; mis-matched pairs often yield <10 % benefit.  
• Economic returns: average yield bump ≈ +12 % at commodity price level, often sufficient to amortise inoculum cost within one season for high-value vegetables.

### 2.3 Facilitation Meta-analysis (Arid & Semi-arid Systems)
• 215 documented facilitation events involving 21 nurse species.  
• AMF increased above-ground biomass by ~25 % and plant P by ~38 % in water-limited contexts.  
• Effect absent (non-significant) in temperate EMF-dominated forest understories.  
• Implication: AMF mobilise P under low moisture; EMF advantages are more about N and organic substrates, thus not captured by above-ground biomass metrics.

## 3. Moderator Analysis
| Moderator | Direction | Mechanistic Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|
| Soil P < 15 mg kg⁻¹ | ++ | AMF P-acquisition pathway more rewarding. |
| Soil disturbance (mining, agriculture) | ++ | Native propagule bank depleted, making inoculation decisive. |
| pH 5.5–7.5 | + | Optimal for hyphal growth; extremes suppress colonisation. |
| Host photosynthetic pathway (C₄) | + | Higher C supply to fungi per water unit. |
| Fertiliser P ≥ 45 kg ha⁻¹ | − | Down-regulation of AM‐induced P transporter genes (e.g., _PvPht1;1_). |
| Brassicaceae host | − | Glucosinolates suppress AMF.

## 4. Mycorrhizal Type‐Specific Patterns
1. **Arbuscular (AMF)**: Ubiquitous in herbaceous crops, grasses, many tropical trees. Strong biomass response in low-P soils; ~80 % of documented inoculation products are AMF based.  
2. **Ectomycorrhizal (EMF)**: Pinaceae, Fagaceae forests. Biomass responses modest in short term; benefits often manifest as nutrient storage and drought resistance, not necessarily mass accumulation.  
3. **Ericoid & Orchid**: Specialist; limited agronomic relevance but critical in heathlands, peatlands, horticultural blueberries. Data sparse.  
4. **Dual / Mixed Consortia**: Emerging concept—sequential inoculation (AMF then EMF) for mixed plantations; evidence preliminary.

## 5. Inoculum Source & Formulation
• **Commercial single-species spores**: Highest mean biomass (+41 %); sterility allows regulatory clearance, but potential narrow niche.  
• **Commercial multi-species mixes**: Broader host range but 10–15 % lower effect size; some taxa redundant/antagonistic.  
• **Native consortia (field soil, trap cultures)**: Superior long-term persistence, local adaptation; logistic & phytosanitary constraints.  
• **On-farm in-situ production**: Compost-based or ‘bioreactor’ methods lowering cost by 60–80 %; still R&D phase.

## 6. Controlled vs. Field Contexts
• **Greenhouse**: Mean effect sizes 20–50 % higher due to reduced native competitor fungi and controlled stressors.  
• **Field (agricultural)**: Signal often diluted by resident AMF; meaningful only when native propagules suppressed by tillage, fumigation, or high disturbance.  
• **Field (restoration)**: Highest relative gains because baseline inoculum often near zero.

## 7. Mechanistic Insights
1. **Enhanced P uptake**: Up-regulation of PHT1 transporter family in roots; hyphal network effectively extends rhizosphere by 10–20 ×.  
2. **Water relations**: Hyphal glycoproteins (glomalin) improve soil aggregation and water retention, yielding indirect biomass gains in arid systems.  
3. **Hormonal crosstalk**: AMF synthesise auxin-like compounds; altered root architecture (↑ lateral roots) increases resource capture.  
4. **Microbiome assembly**: AMF act as ‘keystone guild’, recruiting PGPR and suppressing pathogens (ISR activation).  
5. **Carbon cost vs. benefit**: Hosts allocate 4–20 % photosynthate to AMF; increase in biomass indicates net positive C exchange except under high P.

## 8. Practical Implications & Decision Framework
1. **Agronomy**  
   – Target low- to medium-P soils; reduce starter P to enhance colonisation.  
   – Pair crop family with proven AMF genus (see lookup table, Appendix A).  
   – Inoculate at seeding/transplant (~150–300 viable spores per plant) or via seed coating; avoid fungicidal seed treatments.  
2. **Restoration Ecology**  
   – Co-apply AMF with N-fixers to accelerate nutrient cycling.  
   – Use site-specific consortia; precondition nursery seedlings for 6–8 weeks.  
3. **Forestry**  
   – EMF inoculation mainly justified on nutrient-poor sands / mine spoils.  
   – Consider dual EMF-N₂ fixer nurse species (e.g. _Alnus_) for synergistic effects.  
4. **Economic Considerations**  
   – Break-even analysis typically 1–3 yr in horticulture; 4–6 yr in forestry.  
   – On-farm inoculum production could reach <US$0.10 per thousand spores within 5 yr (speculative, see Section 11).

## 9. Limitations and Research Gaps
• Lack of **long-term (>10 yr)** performance data, especially for EMF.  
• Insufficient **trait-based matching algorithms** linking host genetics to fungal functional traits.  
• Minimal quantification of **greenhouse gas trade-offs** (mycorrhizae may alter N₂O flux).  
• **Soil microbiome interactions** (phages, protists) largely ignored.  
• **Regulatory heterogeneity** hampers cross-border inoculum exchange.

## 10. Recommendations for Future Work
1. Establish **global network of common-garden field trials** standardised for inoculum dose, soil chemistry, and host genotype.  
2. Develop **omics-guided selection** pipelines: pan-genome + metabolome screens to predict host × AMF compatibility.  
3. Invest in **decision-support software** integrating soil test data, climatic variables, and inoculum performance meta-data.  
4. Encourage **open-source spore banks** and data repositories to democratise access.  
5. Explore **stacked inoculants** (AMF + PGPR + biocontrol fungi) for multi-functional benefits.

## 11. Speculative / Emerging Directions ⚠️
• **CRISPR-enabled AMF** strains with enhanced P transporter expression or drought-induced aquaporin up-regulation (regulatory hurdles high).  
• **Synthetic biology ‘minimal mycorrhizae’**: engineer _Saccharomyces_ chassis to deliver AMF effector peptides to roots without full symbiosis.  
• **In situ spatio-temporal monitoring** via nano-sensor hyphal probes, enabling dynamic fertiliser tuning.  
• **Machine-learning-driven consortia design**: generative models proposing novel fungal combinations optimised for target soil microbiomes.  
• **Biochar-bound inocula** for slow release and hyphal protection during drought.

## 12. Concluding Statement
The cumulative evidence is unequivocal: **mycorrhizal inoculation, particularly with well-matched arbuscular taxa, reliably increases plant biomass in soils where native propagules are limiting or nutrient availability (chiefly phosphorus) constrains growth.** Effect sizes vary widely but can exceed 40 % in crops and 100 % in restoration settings. Capitalising on this potential will require precision matching of host, fungal genotype, soil conditions, and management practices, coupled with rigorous long-term field validation.
