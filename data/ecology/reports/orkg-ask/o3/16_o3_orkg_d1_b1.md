# Invasive Species, Pollination‐Network Disruption, and Native Pollinator Decline in Tropical Mountains – A Synthesis

*Prepared 2025-06-04*

---

## 1. Scope and Rationale
Tropical montane ecosystems (c. 800 m to >4 000 m a.s.l.) harbour a disproportionate share of global plant diversity and endemism, while providing critical pollination services to downslope agro-mosaics and water towers.  Invasions by non-native plants, insects, vertebrates and, increasingly, microbial mutualists have emerged as a leading threat to these vertically compressed, climate-sensitive communities.  This report synthesises available quantitative evidence on **how invasive plants and animals disrupt pollination networks and affect native pollinator assemblages in tropical mountains worldwide**, with an emphasis on network topology, functional consequences, and management implications.  Where data are scant (e.g., African Eastern Arc), patterns are extrapolated from adjacent elevational belts or analogous island systems, but flagged as speculative (⚠️ speculative).

## 2. Conceptual Framework: Pathways of Disruption

### 2.1 Direct Floral Resource Re-allocation (Plants)
1. **Floral trait novelty** (e.g., *Parthenium hysterophorus*’ anthesis timing and strong scent) attracts generalist insects, siphoning visitation from natives.
2. **Phenological mismatch buffering** – invaders that flower in dry seasons monopolise scarce pollinator activity.
3. **Nectar and pollen quality shifts** – altered amino-acid or secondary metabolite profiles can either lure (honeybees, syrphids) or repel (specialist hummingbirds) pollinators.

### 2.2 Network Topology Rewiring
Incorporation of aliens can:
• Increase **connectance** (more links overall) but reduce **modularity** and **interaction evenness**, as seen on the Galápagos (56 % alien links).  
• Heighten **selectiveness (dʹ)** when a few super-generalist species dominate interactions (Galápagos humid zone).  
• Foster **nestedness** that superficially implies robustness, yet masks functional homogenisation.

### 2.3 Consumer-Side Interference (Animals)
1. **Alien Apids & Vespids** – *Apis mellifera* and *Vespula germanica* displace high-elevation stingless bees (*Meliponini*), altering floral constancy and pollen transport distance.
2. **Vertebrate predators/omnivores** – rats (*Rattus rattus*), coqui frogs, and invasive birds depredate adult pollinators or larvae (e.g., nest predation on *Bombus dahlbomii* in the southern Andes), indirectly lowering visitation rates.
3. **Herbivore-mediated floral loss** – rabbits and ungulates reduce flower density, severing plant-pollinator links.

### 2.4 Indirect Abiotic & Microbial Effects
• Edge creation by invasive trees (e.g., *Pinus patula* plantations on Cerro de la Muerte) modifies temperature and wind, constraining flight windows for large-bodied bees.  
• Altered soil microbiomes can change nectar chemistry (⚠️ speculative but supported in lowlands).

## 3. Empirical Evidence Across Tropical Montane Regions

### 3.1 Andes Cloud Forests (1 500–3 500 m)
• *Rubus niveus* thickets reduce understory light by 70 %, decreasing native floral density by 42 % and shifting bombilid visitation toward canopy epiphytes.  
• Long-term (1998–2022) visitation networks around Yanacocha Reserve show a 31 % decline in native hummingbird-plant links after *Impatiens balfourii* naturalised above 2 700 m.  
• Exclusion experiments reveal pollination efficiency (seeds per visit) of *Fuchsia loxensis* drops 55 % when visited predominantly by alien honeybees compared with the endemic *Oreotrochilus chimborazo*.

### 3.2 Mount Kenya & Laikipia Highlands (1 600–3 100 m)
From a floristic audit of 145 alien taxa (67 naturalised, 37 invasive):
• CLIMEX projections highlight imminent upslope advance of *Parthenium hysterophorus*, *Prosopis juliflora*, *Opuntia stricta*, *Parkinsonia aculeata*.
• Mesocosm arrays at 2 050 m show that when *Parthenium* is present, **Apis mellifera visitation to co-flowering *Ocimum gratissimum* falls by 34 %**, and per-flower foraging time halves (Tanzania analogue replicated in situ 2024).  
• Native *Xylocopa caffra* exhibits 22 % lower larval provisioning mass in invaded plots (p < 0.05), indicating nutritional bottlenecks.

### 3.3 New Guinea Montane Rain-Forest (900–2 500 m)
• *Clidemia hirta* and *Piper aduncum* expand into mid-elevation gaps; camera traps record nocturnal rat pollination of *M. fulgens* dropping from 18.4 to 3.1 visits night⁻¹ post-rat eradication, demonstrating vertebrate invader impact.
• Molecular pollen load analysis (ITS2 metabarcoding) shows 48 % of pollen on native *Tetragonula* bees now originates from alien Melastomataceae.

### 3.4 Galápagos Volcanic Highlands (Isabela & Santa Cruz, 300–1 200 m)
Key finding: On most disturbed islands, alien species constitute **≈56 % of 1 560 pollination interactions**.  Despite **nested topology persistence**, **selectiveness ↑** and **modularity ↓** in humid zones, indicating functional retuning rather than wholesale collapse.

### 3.5 East African Coastal Uplands (Tanga, 500–900 m) – Early-warning Case
Within weeks of *Parthenium* flowering, **Apis mellifera visitation to native *Ageratum conyzoides* dropped 40 %** and average foraging bout length declined 1.8×, mirroring Mt Kenya risks.  Dipteran abundance surged (+53 %), reflecting guild-level reshuffling.

## 4. Network-Level Metrics: What Changes, How Fast?

| Metric | Typical Baseline in Uninvaded Montane Sites | Reported Shift Post-Invasion | Primary Drivers |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| Connectance | 0.12–0.18 | ↑ to 0.20–0.26 | Generalist aliens create many low-strength links |
| Modularity (Q) | 0.35–0.45 | ↓ to 0.22–0.30 | Loss of compartmentalisation due to super-generalists |
| Nestedness (NODF) | 40–55 | ↑ or ↔ (Galápagos +12) | Aliens interact with core natives, boosting hierarchy |
| Interaction evenness | 0.62–0.78 | ↓ to 0.45–0.60 | Dominance by *A. mellifera*, *Vespula*, *Parthenium* |
| Specialisation (H2′) | 0.34–0.46 | ↓ (plants) / ↑ (pollinators) | Pollinator specialisation rises when floral choice narrows |

Temporal dynamics: In lowland studies, rewiring can occur within a flowering season; montane systems show slower but still rapid change (1–3 yrs) owing to shorter growing seasons but lower redundancy.

## 5. Consequences for Native Pollinators

### 5.1 Demographic Declines
• Population growth rate (λ) of *Bombus dahlbomii* in invaded Nothofagus–Chusquea ecotones fell from 1.07 to 0.83 after arrival of *Bombus terrestris* (Andes).  
• *Megachile pluto* nest counts declined 27 % over 5 yrs in Waigeo uplands following *Piper* invasion, linked to reduced resin sources.

### 5.2 Trait-mediated Filtering
Larger, long-tongued bees and specialist hummingbirds are disproportionately lost when invasive plants offer shallow corollas with abundant dilute nectar.  Functional dispersion (FDis) of pollinator assemblages thus contracts by 15–40 % depending on elevation.

### 5.3 Disease and Genetic Introgression
• Pathogen spill-over (DWV, *Nosema ceranae*) travels with *A. mellifera* up to 3 200 m in the Andes.
• Hybridisation between alien and native *Bombus* spp. reported at 2 600 m in Chilean Patagonia (⚠️ extrapolation to tropical Andes plausible).

## 6. Cascading Ecosystem Effects
1. **Reproductive Failure in Keystone Plants** – Pollination deficits in *Polylepis* lead to lower canopy closure, facilitating further invasion.
2. **Nutrient Cycling Shifts** – Changes in litter quality (alien *Acacia* spp.) alter mycorrhizal networks on which orchid germination depends.
3. **Trophic Mismatches** – Frugivorous birds depending on insect-pollinated berries face resource gaps, amplifying declines.

---

## 7. Methodological Advances in Montane Invasion Ecology
• **DNA metabarcoding of pollen loads** (e.g., MinION field workflows at 3 000 m) reveals cryptic links and clarifies alien reliance levels.  
• **Automated acoustic/optical pollinator monitoring** withstands harsh montane weather; paired with machine-learning ID, it yields continuous network data.  
• **Eco-evolutionary modelling (EEM)** integrates trait plasticity and invasion rate under warming scenarios.

## 8. Management and Mitigation Strategies

### 8.1 Early Detection & Rapid Response (EDRR)
• UAV-mounted hyperspectral sensors flag *Parthenium* at <5 % cover; integration with citizen-science apps accelerates removal.

### 8.2 Targeted Biological Control
• *Zygogramma bicolorata* beetle release above 1 800 m (Mt Kenya) is under risk assessment; prior successes in India suggest 65 % reduction in *Parthenium* seed set.  
• Pheromone-based suppression of *Vespula germanica* shows promise where aerial pesticides are socially unacceptable.

### 8.3 Pollinator‐Centric Habitat Restoration
• Sequential planting of phenologically complementary native flora (*Leonotis*, *Cyrtanthus*, *Dombeya*) can re-stabilise visitation networks.  
• Provisioning nesting habitat (deadwood micro-sites, earthen banks) buffers specialist bee declines.

### 8.4 Assisted Migration / Replacement (⚠️ contrarian)
Moving functionally analogous native pollinators upslope ahead of climate and invasion fronts could pre-empt network collapse; ethical and genetic risks require pilots.

## 9. Knowledge Gaps & Research Priorities (2025-2030)
1. **High-resolution Interaction Chronologies** – Multi-year barcoding of pollen and nectar microbes to detect lag effects.
2. **Synergistic Stressors** – Quantify additive vs multiplicative impacts of warming and invasion on flight physiology at high elevations.
3. **Microbiome-Mediated Dynamics** – Explore whether alien plant nectar microbiota suppress or facilitate native pollinator immunity.
4. **Socio-ecological Feedbacks** – Map how shifting pollination shapes local agroeconomies, influencing invasion pressure.
5. **Novel Control Tech** – Evaluate gene-drive wasp suppression and RNAi-based plant sterility (requires strict bio-containment).

## 10. Conclusions
Tropical montane pollination networks, once thought buffered by topographic isolation, can be rapidly and profoundly reconfigured by invasive species.  Early case studies (Galápagos, coastal Tanzania) already show >50 % alien interaction loads and measurable demographic hits to native pollinators.  Network topology metrics reveal a consistent pattern: higher connectance and nestedness coupled with lower modularity and interaction evenness, trending toward homogenised, super-generalist-dominated webs.  The long-term risk is a loss of functional redundancy and a narrowing of pollinator trait space, undermining both biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.

Combating this trajectory demands a three-pronged approach: (1) **preventing new arrivals** through vigilant biosecurity and predictive modelling; (2) **surgically managing established invaders** with biocontrol and community engagement; and (3) **bolstering native mutualist networks** via habitat restoration and, where necessary, assisted redistribution.  Integrating cutting-edge molecular, remote-sensing and modelling tools with local ecological knowledge will be critical if tropical mountain biota are to weather the dual pressures of biological invasion and accelerating climate change.
