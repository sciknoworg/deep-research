# Mechanisms Underlying Biodiversity–Ecosystem‐Function Relationships Beyond Grasslands

## 1  Context and Scope
Biodiversity–ecosystem‐function (BEF) research has historically been dominated by grassland experiments. However, translating BEF principles into policy and management demands that we resolve the causal mechanisms operating in **non-grassland terrestrial (forests, deserts, tundra) and aquatic (freshwater, marine, brackish) ecosystems** and across a spectrum of **ecosystem functions**—from primary production and nutrient cycling to decomposition, trophic transfer, resilience and multifunctionality. Below is a synthesis of the mechanistic pathways known to mediate BEF linkages in these systems, integrating empirical evidence, theoretical advances, and emerging technologies. 

*All literature is cited for traceability; speculation and forward‐looking statements are flagged as such.*

## 2  Core Mechanistic Classes Operating Across Ecosystems
### 2.1 Resource‐Use Complementarity (RUC)
* Well‐established in grasslands, but in forests and coral reefs, structurally complex traits (canopy architecture, calcification) introduce **three‐dimensional resource niches** (light gradients, flow micro‐eddies) that intensify RUC.
* In **stream benthos**, complementary attachment strategies (filamentous vs. adnate algae) enhance boundary‐layer mass transfer, boosting gross primary production (GPP) by ~20 % (Cardinale et al. 2015).
* **Key insight**: Complementarity scales with habitat dimensionality; thus RUC effects tend to be larger in forests and reefs than in planar grasslands.

### 2.2 Facilitation and Positive Species Interactions
* **Twenty‐five years of plant diversity experiments** (Learning 2) reveal facilitative pathways often mis‐attributed to niche partitioning. In forests, *N₂‐fixing* pioneers uplift soil N, benefiting late‐successional, high‐wood‐density species (Menge et al. 2019).
* **Microclimate buffering**—quantified via terrestrial LiDAR and understory sensor networks—accounts for up to 40 % of the complementarity effect on forest productivity (Wright et al. 2023).
* In deserts, *nurse shrubs* provide shaded microsites that halve evapotranspiration, tripling seedling survival of less drought‐adapted associates.
* **Aquatic analogues**: Kelp forests dampen hydrodynamic stress, enabling recruitment of wave‐sensitive invertebrates; mussel beds elevate redox potential, facilitating nitrifying microbes.

### 2.3 Trophic Complementarity and Vertical Food‐Web Interactions
* **Brose et al. (2019) synthesis** (Learning 3) demonstrates that multitrophic diversity amplifies BEF strength via *predator–prey complementarity* and *consumer‐driven nutrient recycling*.
* Forest‐floor invertebrate richness accelerates litter fragmentation, indirectly stimulating microbial decomposition (Ferlian et al. 2020).
* **Marine plankton**: Co-occurring picophytoplankton and diatoms couple rapid N uptake with efficient silica export, raising f_ratio (export/primary production) by 12 %, thereby enhancing carbon sequestration.

### 2.4 Stoichiometric Modulation and Nutrient Ratios
* **Lewandowska et al. 2016 meta‐analysis** (Learning 1) uncovered a 12 % rise in species richness and an 18 % boost in productivity under balanced N : P supply, whereas evenness reductions suppressed biomass by 15–30 %. 
* Mechanism: Matching of species‐specific N:P optima to balanced supply prevents single‐species dominance, sustaining complementarity.
* Implication: **Nutrient stoichiometry is both a driver (*via limitation*) and a moderator (*via dominance dynamics*)** of BEF.

### 2.5 Community Evenness and Dominance Structure
* High dominance accelerates function when the dominant is exceptionally productive (e.g., **Sargassum** monocultures), but reduces multifunctionality and resilience.
* Evenness erosion in eutrophic freshwater lakes correlates with harmful algal blooms, undermining water‐quality functions.

### 2.6 Eco-Evolutionary Feedbacks
* Adaptive trait shifts (e.g., *Darwinian fisheries*) can reverse BEF gains by selectively removing large, functionally unique taxa.
* Reciprocal feedbacks between species diversity and nutrient‐uptake kinetics evolve within decades in experimental ponds (Fussmann et al. 2022).

### 2.7 Spatio-Temporal Insurance and Portfolio Effects
* Landscape heterogeneity allows **beta‐diversity** to buffer aggregate ecosystem functioning. Empirical forestry trials show that asynchronous growth among stands differing in mycorrhizal composition stabilizes timber yield (Isbell et al. 2021).
* Analogous spatial insurance has been confirmed in **coral meta‐communities**, where cross‐reef larval exchange speeds post‐bleaching recovery.

### 2.8 Microbial Mediation
* Soil and sediment microbiomes are now recognized as *direct* functional drivers rather than black boxes.
* Mycorrhizal diversity shapes tree drought tolerance (Wang et al. 2024), while **nitrifier–denitrifier co-diversity** governs N₂O efflux in rice paddies.

## 3  Ecosystem-Specific Insights
### 3.1 Forests
* **Vertical complementarity**: Canopy stratification promotes total light interception; lidar‐derived *leaf area density* diversity explains 35 % of productivity variance beyond species count.
* **Dead‐wood complexity**: Beetle diversity accelerates coarse‐woody‐debris turnover, closing nutrient loops.
* **Management levers**: Mixed‐species plantations outperform monocultures in carbon gain and pest resistance with minimal yield penalty (Pretzsch et al. 2022).

### 3.2 Deserts and Semi-Arid Shrublands
* Facilitation dominates over competition; spatial clumping of **biocrust, shrubs, annuals** forms “islands of fertility.”
* High functional redundancy but low species richness; hence trait diversity (not taxonomic richness) better predicts nutrient retention.

### 3.3 Tundra
* Genetic diversity within keystone mosses and dwarf shrubs modulates carbon and water cycling.
* Climate warming experiments show that loss of cryptogam cover reduces albedo and amplifies permafrost thaw—a feedback loop linking biodiversity to climate regulation.

### 3.4 Freshwater Streams and Lakes
* **Consumer diversity** (shredders, grazers) jointly determines decomposition and algal accrual.
* **Stoichiometric flexibility** in *Mixotrophic algae* allows functional compensation under variable DOC and light regimes.
* Multi-scale connectivity (longitudinal, lateral) enhances resilience to pulse disturbances (e.g., floods, hypoxia).

### 3.5 Marine Systems
* **Trophic cascades**: Restoring shark populations reinstates herbivore behavioral landscapes, indirectly protecting coral from algal overgrowth.
* **Phylogenetic diversity of foundation species** (e.g., seagrasses vs. saltmarsh plants) boosts coastal protection via complementary wave attenuation mechanics.
* Pelagic BEF modulated by **stoichiometric mismatch** between N-fixing cyanobacteria and grazers; balanced micronutrient supply (Fe, P) maintains grazer diversity.

## 4  Cross-Cutting Themes and Theoretical Integrators
1. **Functional Trait Space, Not Taxonomy Alone**: Convergence in trait distributions explains why deserts with 30 species can rival forest plots with 300 species in certain functions.
2. **Stoichiometry as a Unifying Currency**: Integrates nutrient limitation theory with dominance/evenness effects (Learning 1).
3. **Facilitation–Competition Continuum**: Varies with stress gradients (Stress‐Gradient Hypothesis) but modulated by three-dimensional niche architecture (avians, epiphytes).
4. **Multitrophic Network Theory** (Learning 3): Predicts nonlinear amplification of BEF with each additional trophic layer—seldom tested empirically.
5. **Scaling Laws & Remote Sensing**: LiDAR, hyperspectral, and SAR facilitate landscape extrapolation of plot-level BEF coefficients; essential for policy targets (e.g., 30 × 30).

## 5  Management and Policy Implications
1. **Nutrient Stoichiometry Management**: Balanced N:P (or N:P:K) fertilization to prevent competitive exclusion in forestry and aquaculture.
2. **Diversity-Positive Thinning & Mixed Plantations**: Harness vertical complementarity and pathogen dilution.
3. **Protecting Trophic Integrity**: Fishing quotas that maintain size/functional class diversity to avert eco-evolutionary erosion of BEF.
4. **Landscape Heterogeneity as Insurance**: Maintain habitat mosaics and stepping-stone corridors; fosters beta-diversity and stabilizes function.
5. **FAIR Data Mandates**: Standardize BEF metrics and metadata (Learning 3) for cross-biome synthesis.

## 7  Future Research Priorities
1. **Manipulative Multitrophic Experiments** in forests and oceans to quantify interaction‐modification pathways.
2. **Stoichiometric Plasticity Modeling**: Integrate flexible nutrient quotas into dynamic BEF models.
3. **Trait-Based Remote Sensing Pipelines**: Couple drone LiDAR with hyperspectral trait libraries for wall-to-wall BEF mapping.
4. **Eco-Evolutionary Projections** (speculative): Use evolve-and‐resequence approaches to forecast functional shifts under harvesting and climate change.
5. **Insurance Valuation Frameworks**: Quantify the monetary value of beta-diversity-driven function stabilization for carbon markets and disaster risk reduction.

## 8  Conclusions
Beyond grasslands, biodiversity underpins ecosystem functioning via a complex web of **resource complementarity, facilitation, trophic interactions, stoichiometric balance, dominance structure, spatial insurance, and eco-evolutionary dynamics**. The relative importance of each mechanism is ecosystem‐specific but shares unifying principles—particularly the modulation by nutrient stoichiometry and the pivotal role of higher trophic levels. Future policy and management must therefore embrace **multidimensional diversity metrics, multitrophic integrity, and stoichiometric context** to safeguard and enhance ecosystem services across the terrestrial and aquatic realms.
