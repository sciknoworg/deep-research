# Current and Emerging Challenges for Biodiversity – A Comprehensive Global Assessment  
*Date: 2 June 2025*  
*Prepared for: Senior‐level analysts and decision-makers*

## 1. Executive Summary  
Global biodiversity continues to erode across virtually all biomes. The latest high-resolution GLOBIO-4 projections (300 m) show mean species abundance (MSA) slipping from **0.56 in 2015 to 0.50–0.54 by 2050**, with sub-Saharan Africa the hardest hit. Traditional pressures—habitat conversion, over-exploitation, invasive species, pollution and climate change—remain dominant, yet the governance architecture meant to address them is itself becoming a central challenge. Three structural fault-lines stand out:  
1. **Governance & Finance Gaps** – The CBD post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) is under-funded by an estimated US $700 billion yr⁻¹; harmful subsidies persist; and nature-based solution (NbS) monitoring lacks agreed standards.  
2. **Access & Benefit-Sharing (ABS) Friction** – The 2010 Nagoya Protocol introduced Prior Informed Consent (PIC) and Mutually Agreed Terms (MAT) for genetic resources, but implementation is uneven, private-international-law gaps remain, and marine & synthetic-biology realms are only partially covered.  
3. **Emerging Tech & Biosecurity Uncertainty** – Gene-editing, gene drives and synthetic biology offer both conservation tools and novel ecological risks. Current treaties (Cartagena, Nagoya, Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol) leave liability and transboundary governance loopholes, prompting calls for a dedicated post-2025 instrument.

Addressing these intertwined challenges demands: (i) aligning climate-biodiversity finance, (ii) fast-tracking ABS harmonisation, (iii) adopting a next-generation synthetic-biology risk-governance toolkit based on prudent vigilance and Bayesian network assessments, and (iv) mobilising broad societal uptake via IPBES-level science that resonates with publics and markets.

## 2. State of Biodiversity – Quantitative Signals  
• **GLOBIO-4 (2023)** – Global MSA projected declines by 2050 relative to 2015 baseline:  
  – SSP1-RCP2.6 («Sustainability»): −0.02 (0.56→0.54).  
  – SSP3-RCP6.0 («Regional Rivalry»): −0.06 (0.56→0.50).  
  – SSP5-RCP8.5 («Fossil-fuelled Development»): −0.05 (0.56→0.51).  
  Hotspots of loss: sub-Saharan Africa, SE Asia, Amazon Basin, and infrastructure corridors (Belt & Road, Arctic shipping lanes).  
• **IUCN Red List 2024** – >44,000 species threatened (28% of assessed).  
• **Living Planet Index 2024** – Average vertebrate populations fallen 69% since 1970.

Interpretation: Even under optimistic socio-economic pathways, biodiversity decline continues, driven by sheer scale of land, water and resource demand. Land-demand reduction alone cannot compensate; synergistic climate and infrastructure pressures must be tackled concurrently.

---

## 3. Classical Direct Drivers  
1. **Habitat Loss & Fragmentation** – Agricultural expansion adds ~5 M ha yr⁻¹; urban areas projected to triple by 2050.  
2. **Over-exploitation** – 34% of marine stocks fished at biologically unsustainable levels; illegal wildlife trade worth US $7–23 billion yr⁻¹.  
3. **Pollution** – Nutrient loading dominates freshwater systems; synthetic chemicals (>350,000 registered) create planetary-boundary transgressions (Persson et al., 2022).  
4. **Invasive Alien Species (IAS)** – Costing ~US $423 billion yr⁻¹ globally (Diagne et al., 2021); gene-drive consideration emerges both as control and risk vector.  
5. **Climate Change** – >90% coral reefs at risk even under 1.5 °C; species range shifts averaging 17 km poleward per decade.  

---

## 4. Indirect & Socio-economic Drivers  
• **Demographic Pressure** – Global population 9.7 billion by 2050; urban middle class intake of animal protein and biomass intensifies land-use.  
• **Economic & Trade Dynamics** – Globalised supply chains externalise habitat loss (e.g., EU imported deforestation embedded in soy, beef, palm oil).  
• **Governance Quality** – Weak land-tenure and corruption amplify illegal logging/mining.  
• **Subsidy Misalignment** – US $1.8 trillion in environmentally harmful subsidies (OECD 2022) dwarf conservation budgets.  

---

## 5. Policy & Management Challenges  
### 5.1 Funding Gap  
• *COP26–COP15 assessment*: annual biodiversity finance needs ~US $876 billion; current flows ~US $124 billion.  
• Private capital mobilisation hindered by lack of standardised NbS efficacy metrics.  

### 5.2 Governance Coherence  
• Climate and biodiversity treaties still operate in silos; Article 6 carbon markets risk perverse land-grab outcomes unless biodiversity safeguards mandated.  
• No legally binding global target on harmful subsidies comparable to Montreal Protocol’s phase-out schedules.  

### 5.3 Monitoring & Reporting  
• GEOBON Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) remain patchily integrated into national accounting; remote-sensing data uptake uneven across Global South.

### 5.4 Issue-Maturation Stagnation  
Issue-maturation literature frames biodiversity at a “Challenge-to-Governance” inflection: societal uptake lags because economic-growth benefits obscure biotic decline. Scholars urge IPBES to engage non-governmental actors and craft narratives that resonate beyond academia—echoing the IPCC’s successful public salience.

---

## 6. Access & Benefit-Sharing (ABS) Under the Nagoya Protocol  
### 6.1 Legal Architecture  
• **Binding Duties** (since Oct 2014): PIC, MAT, fair & equitable benefit-sharing for cross-border transfer of genetic resources / traditional knowledge (TK).  
• **Gaps Identified** (Univ. of Alicante, 2020):  
  – Lack of exclusive forum for dispute resolution; private-international-law ambiguity.  
  – Marine genetic resources (beyond national jurisdiction) fall into grey zone vis-à-vis BBNJ negotiations.  
• **Scholarly Proposals**:  
  – Exclusive provider-state forum to adjudicate ABS disputes.  
  – Linkage with WTO/TRIPS & WIPO to protect TK and prevent biopiracy.  
  – Extension to human genetic resources to avoid fragmented patchwork (contra current explicit exclusion).  

### 6.2 Regional Implementation  
• **Latin America & Caribbean (Ópera, 2021)** – Four hurdles:  
  1. Drafting coherent national ABS regimes.  
  2. Extending rules to marine resources.  
  3. Policing biopiracy/unauthorised use.  
  4. Ensuring benefit-sharing does not stifle research.  
• **Malaysia Case Study** – Domestic PIC frameworks strengthen Indigenous TK protection; legislative, administrative, policy actions aligned to Nagoya.  

### 6.3 Interaction with Emerging Tech  
Synthetic biology and digital sequence information (DSI) blur “genetic resource” boundaries; negotiating group at CBD COP16 (2024) failed to finalise a multilateral benefit-sharing mechanism for DSI, leaving uncertainty for researchers and industry.

## 7. Synthetic Biology, Gene Drives & Biosecurity  
### 7.1 Opportunity–Risk Duality  
• **Conservation Applications** – Gene drives to eradicate invasive rodents on islands; engineered coral resistance to bleaching.  
• **Risk Vectors** – Off-target spread, ecological cascade effects, geopolitical misuse.  

### 7.2 Governance Landscape  
1. **Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (2003)** – LMO risk-assessment focus, but ambiguous on gene drives.  
2. **Nagoya–Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol (2010)** – Administrative-order liability for GMO damage; civil liability optional; implementation gaps.  
3. **Next-Gen Toolkit** – Precautionary Principle + “prudent vigilance” (US Presidential Commission on Bioethics, 2010) + Bayesian network assessments, mapped to GBF 2030 targets.  
4. **Biosecurity “Network-of-Networks”** – Shift from pathogen-centric to synthetic-biology safeguards; treat biosecurity spending as innovation insurance; embed social-science foresight early.  

### 7.3 Identified Gaps  
• No binding norms on transboundary movement or liability specific to gene drives.  
• Developing countries risk being locked out of benefits if IP, capacity and insurance frameworks are not equitable.  

(✱ *Speculative*: A post-2025 dedicated protocol—“CBD Protocol on Synthetic Biology & Gene Drives”—is increasingly plausible, though politically contentious.)

---

## 8. Climate–Biodiversity Nexus & Nature-based Solutions (NbS)  
• COP26 recognised NbS but lacked uniform monitoring framework; methodologies now proliferate (IUCN, SBTN, TNFD), risking fragmentation.  
• Under-funding persists; redirecting even 10% of fossil-fuel subsidies (~US $5.9 trillion yr⁻¹ IMF estimate) could close biodiversity finance gap.  
• Risk of perverse outcomes: large-scale monoculture afforestation undermines biodiversity despite carbon gains.  

---

## 9. Priority Actions & Recommendations  
1. **Integrate Biodiversity Safeguards into Article 6 Carbon Markets**  
   – Require EBV-aligned biodiversity impact assessment for every NbS credit.  
2. **Fast-Track ABS Harmonisation**  
   – Adopt exclusive provider-state forum for dispute adjudication; pilot in LAC region.  
   – Negotiate DSI multilateral mechanism with tiered access fees tied to open-data milestones.  
3. **Launch a Synthetic-Biology Risk Governance Accelerator**  
   – Multi-stakeholder platform (governments, industry, Indigenous communities) to test Bayesian network assessments for gene-drive field trials.  
4. **Phase Out Harmful Subsidies by 2030**  
   – Establish CBD-level reporting & verification analog to UNFCCC Biennial Transparency Reports.  
5. **Scale Up Public-Engagement Science**  
   – IPBES to release “Biodiversity Synthesis for Citizens” similar to IPCC SPM; leverage compelling narratives to shift consumption patterns.  
6. **Embed Biodiversity Accounting in Financial Regulation**  
   – Central banks to stress-test portfolios against biodiversity loss scenarios (following NGFS Nature Taskforce guidance).  
7. **Close the Conservation Finance Gap**  
   – Deploy debt-for-nature swaps, green bonds, and biodiversity-linked derivatives; ensure transparent, standardised impact metrics.

## 10. Outlook (2025-2050)  
• *Baseline Trajectory*: Continued net decline in MSA by 0.05-0.06, with uneven regional suffering.  
• *Transformative Pathway*: Achievable if biodiversity mainstreaming matches climate ambition—requires US $500-700 billion yr⁻¹ new money, subsidy reform and strong synthetic-biology governance.  
• *Wildcards* (✱ *Speculative*):  
  – Rapid roll-out of carbon-negative biotech could lower land-pressure faster than models assume.  
  – Societal backlash against gene drives may freeze biotech solutions.  
  – Geo-engineering (e.g., solar radiation management) could trigger novel ecological disturbances.  

---

## 11. Concluding Remarks  
The biodiversity crisis sits at a critical governance juncture. Classic conservation levers alone cannot reverse current trajectories; we must synchronise them with cutting-edge technology governance, equitable ABS frameworks, and holistic climate finance. Failure to fill treaty gaps—especially around synthetic biology and benefit-sharing—risks replacing one set of ecological externalities with another. Conversely, integrated, well-funded, and socially resonant strategies could stabilise and even restore biodiversity within a generation.
