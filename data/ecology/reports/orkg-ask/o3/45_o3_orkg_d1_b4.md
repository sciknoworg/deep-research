## 1. Abstract
Mountain lakes—often naturally fishless, cold, oligotrophic, and spatially isolated—provide iconic examples of rapid biotic transformation once non-native fishes gain access. Synthesising thirteen recent empirical ‘learnings’ plus broader literature, we dissect *how* fishes become invasive in these systems across three invasion phases: (i) arrival vectors, (ii) establishment mechanisms, and (iii) landscape spread. Intentional trout stocking, live-bait releases, hydropower‐linked dispersal, and climate-assisted range shifts constitute the dominant vectors worldwide. Establishment hinges on a combination of generalized yet slow life histories (high fecundity, late maturity, long lifespan), extreme cold tolerance, capacity for predator-free refugia (e.g., hypoxic littorals), and propagule pressure. New network studies reveal that the *slope* of connecting streams, not geographic proximity per se, best predicts recolonisation risk; dynamic gravity-plus-suitability models yield AUC ≈0.94 for zooplankton analogues, underscoring transferable methodology for fish. Historical trajectories (e.g., sub-Alpine Italy, Pyrenees) highlight decades-long lags, cascade facilitation (trout enabling minnows), and biomass shifts where up to 70 % of individuals now derive from alien taxa. Management must therefore integrate calibrated risk screens (global FISK thresholds), pathway interdiction (angling bans, disinfection of gear, prohibition of live-bait transport), and network-optimised surveillance. Climate change, reservoir proliferation, and potential gene-edited sport fish introductions (flagged speculative) are poised to accelerate invasion pressure absent proactive governance.

## 2. Scope, Definitions & Conceptual Framework
• **Mountain lakes**: natural or artificial lentic waters ≥0.5 ha, typically >800 m a.s.l. (region-dependent), characterised by short growing seasons, prolonged ice cover, low nutrient status, and historically low fish diversity.  
• **Invasive fish**: non-native taxa whose introduction leads to self-sustaining populations that spread, causing ecological or socio-economic harm.  
• **Mechanisms**: both (a) *vectors* that bring propagules into the lake network and (b) *traits / environmental interactions* enabling establishment and spread.

We adopt the classical three-stage invasion model (Introduction → Establishment → Spread) but emphasise feedbacks (e.g., invader-mediated habitat alteration facilitating secondary invaders) and stochasticity in early phases.

## 3. Introduction Pathways (Vectors)
### 3.1 Intentional Fishery Stocking
• Historically dominant in many mountain regions (Rockies, Alps, Andes, Himalayas).  
• Motivations: creation of recreational fisheries, perceived ‘biological enhancement’, pest-control.  
• Example: Italian sub-Alpine lakes (1855-present) – stocking elevated species richness 25–65 %; 14 alien species now supply 65 % biomass (Learning 4).  
• *Mechanism*: high propagule pressure, repeated releases, genetic mixing enhance establishment probability.

### 3.2 Recreational-Angling Vectors (Live-bait & Bucket Releases)
• Anglers transport live minnows, shiners, suckers for bait; discard leftovers.  
• Pyrenees: trout-stocked lakes encourage bait use; minnows now occupy 27 % of 403 surveyed lakes; fishing bans within National Parks halted new minnow incursions (Learnings 6–9).  
• Additional vector: ‘bucket biology’—anglers covertly introduce sport species (e.g., Micropterus salmoides) to create local fisheries.

### 3.3 Unauthorized or “Missionary” Conservation Stockings
• Well-meaning translocations of threatened lowland species into high-altitude refuges (observed for *Coregonus* spp., cyprinids).  
• Risk amplified when mountain lakes lack native piscivorous competitors.

### 3.4 Aquaculture & Hatchery Escape
• High-altitude cage culture of salmonids, tilapias in Andean and Himalayan reservoirs.  
• Flood events breach pens; juveniles disperse to natural lakes via connected hydropower channels.

### 3.5 Natural & Assisted Upstream/Downstream Colonisation
• Reservoir cascades and hydropower tunnels function as dispersal corridors.  
• Scandinavian study (Learning 2) shows that steepness of connecting streams overrides distance; gentler slopes promote recolonisation once barriers removed or bypassed.

### 3.6 Climate-driven Range Shifts and Human-Mediated “Jump” Dispersal
• Warming lengthens growing season, allowing lowland species (e.g., *Cyprinus carpio*) to reproduce at higher elevations.  
• Aircraft, pack-raft, helicopter trout drops—common in remote Rocky Mountain management—constitute long-distance jump dispersal independent of watershed connectivity.

## 4. Establishment Mechanisms – Traits & Environmental Filters
### 4.1 Life-history and Demographic Syndromes
Laurentian Great Lakes analysis (>80 non-indigenous taxa; Learning 7) shows successful cold-lentic invaders share:  
• Small‐to‐moderate body size (facilitates transport).  
• High fecundity & long lifespan – *“generalist-with-slow-life-history”* syndrome.  
• Broad habitat range (bentho-pelagic, littoral & profundal).  
In mountain lakes, these traits confer demographic buffering against variable recruitment and enable gradual population build-up despite short summers.

### 4.2 Physiological Tolerances & Overwintering
• **Extreme Cold Tolerance**: Oriental weatherfish (*Misgurnus anguillicaudatus*) survived –3.6 °C for >100 h; critical thermal minimum −1.8 °C (Learning 11). Antifreeze glycoproteins or membrane restructuring probably involved.  
• **Hypoxia Exploitation**: Carp larvae gain refuge where winterkill suppresses native egg predators (Learning 5). Ability to gulp air or rely on anaerobic metabolism crucial.  
• **Cryoperformance of Early Life Stages**: Delayed hatching or embryonic diapause allows synchronisation with spring thaw.

### 4.3 Reproductive Strategies & Propagule Pressure
• Mass‐spawning (100 000+ eggs per female carp) compensates for stochastic fry survival.  
• Nest guarding (black bullhead), livebearing (gambusia) shorten generation time.  
• Continuous anthropogenic introductions (stocking programmes) magnify propagule supply—statistically main predictor of establishment in quantitative risk models.

### 4.4 Trophic Flexibility & Behavioural Plasticity
• Omnivory permits diet switching when zooplankton or benthos seasonally fluctuate (e.g., brook trout mediated zooplankton compensation; Learning 10).  
• Mobility between littoral, pelagic, and hypolimnetic zones exploits thermal mosaics.

### 4.5 Facilitation by Prior Invaders
• Classic cascade: stocked trout create prey base & angling culture that introduces minnows; minnows further enhance trout growth, reinforcing both populations (positive feedback).  
• Invaders can also engineer habitat (carp turbidity) favouring tolerant followers.

## 5. Landscape-Scale Spread
### 5.1 Connectivity Metrics – Why Slope Trumps Distance
• 367 Scandinavian lakes: logit models show ‘slope along connecting streams’ explains majority of reinvasion variance; straight-line distance adds negligible fit (Learning 2).  
• Management corollary: barrier placement or natural waterfalls in steep catchments provide disproportionate containment.

### 5.2 Propagule‐Pressure Layers Coupled to Lake Suitability
• Dynamic, multi-stage network models (Learning 3) integrate:  
  1. Gravity-based propagule flux (origin × destination attractiveness).  
  2. Stochastic dispersal kernel along network edges.  
  3. Node-specific suitability (pH, phosphorus, conductivity, area, elevation).  
• High forecast skill (AUC ≈0.94) for zooplankton demonstrates transferability to fish; importantly, uncertainty must be propagated through each stage.

### 5.3 Reservoirs & Hydropower Networks as *de facto* Corridors
• Artificial lakes are warmer and more invaded (Learning 12).  
• Turbine pipelines bypass steep gradients, connecting previously isolated basins.

## 6. Case Studies Illustrating Mechanistic Pathways
### 6.1 Trout–Minnow Cascade (Pyrenees)
• Chronology: 19th-century trout stockings → live-bait minnow releases → minnows in 27 % of 403 lakes.  
• GAM: trout presence alone explains 27 % of minnow occurrence deviance.  
• Management success: fishing bans within National Parks yielded near-zero new minnow introductions, confirming vector interception efficacy.

### 6.2 Common Carp Recruitment in Winterkill Lakes (Upper Mississippi)
• Severe ice-cover induces hypoxia; native egg predators die, carp eggs survive via tolerance & sheer output (>100 000 eggs/female).  
• Mobility: adults migrate into hypoxic refugia to spawn, then disperse once oxygen recovers—example of temporal niche exploitation.

### 6.3 Oriental Weatherfish Cold Resilience
• 79 % survival at sub-zero temps, including two individuals fully ice-encased (Learning 11).  
• Mechanism likely involves AFP proteins + cutaneous respiration enabling survival in ice-sealed littoral mud.  
• Implication: small-bodied, benthic loaches pose overlooked threat to alpine lakes once introduced via bait or aquaria.

### 6.4 Sub-Alpine Italian Lakes – 170 Years of Community Reshaping
• Stocking since 1855 introduced *Rutilus rutilus*, *Coregonus lavaretus*, *Micropterus salmoides*, etc.  
• Present: 71.5 % of individuals & 65.1 % biomass are non-native.  
• Demonstrates cumulative effect of sustained propagule pressure plus warming sub-Alpine climate.

## 7. Ecological & Management Implications (Brief)
### 7.1 Risk Screening & Global Prioritisation
• FISK meta-analysis (1 973 assessments, 372 taxa, 45 countries) gives calibrated climate-specific thresholds; nine taxa consistently high-risk (carp, black bullhead, round goby, Amur sleeper, eastern mosquitofish, etc.).  
• Enables pre-border policy triage for mountain regions.

### 7.2 Prevention & Pathway Interdiction
• Ban live-bait transport; mandatory gear disinfection.  
• Regulate or cease helicopter trout drops in wilderness basins.  
• Align hatchery permitting with risk model outputs.

### 7.3 Containment & Network-Optimised Surveillance
• Prioritise outlet barriers on low-slope connectors first (Scandinavian insight).  
• Use gravity-plus-suitability models to allocate eDNA sampling & rapid response teams.

### 7.4 Adaptive Lake-Specific Eradication / Suppression
• Small, isolated lakes: piscicide complete eradication feasible.  
• Larger systems: targeted gill-netting, winter drawdown (where feasible) or biomanipulation via native predators.

## 8. Future Outlook & Speculative Elements (⚠️ flagged)
1. ⚠️ **Climate velocity**: 1–3 km decade⁻¹ upslope warming could allow subtropical species (tilapia) to breach thermal barrier by 2050, especially in dam-moderated catchments.  
2. ⚠️ **Gene-edited sport fish** (e.g., heat-tolerant rainbow trout) under development; inadvertent release may bypass current risk screens.  
3. ⚠️ **Hydrogen-powered drone stocking** could lower logistical cost, increasing propagule pressure in very remote headwaters.  
4. ⚠️ **CRISPR-based biocontrol** (e.g., all-male trout) may become management tool but carries off-target risks in interconnected networks.
