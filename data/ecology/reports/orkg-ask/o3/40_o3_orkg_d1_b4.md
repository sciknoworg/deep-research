# Soil‐Biota Controls on Plant Diversity in Central European Calcareous Soils – A State-of-the-Art Synthesis

*Prepared 2 June 2025*

---

## 1. Scope & Rationale
Calcareous soils (rendzinas, terrae fuscae, dolomitized variants) occupy c. 15 % of Central Europe’s grassland estate and are internationally valued for harboring **exceptionally species-rich forb–graminoid communities** (e.g. *Mesobromion*, *Festuco-Brometea*). Decades of research have shown that abiotic filters (free CaCO₃, thin soil profile, summer droughtiness) are *necessary* but *insufficient* to explain observed α- and β-diversity patterns. Below-ground biota—bacteria, fungi, archaea, protists, nematodes, enchytraeids, collembolans, mites, earthworms—mediate nutrient turnover, pathogen pressure and positive plant–microbe feedbacks and thus strongly modulate plant assembly trajectories.

This report synthesises peer-reviewed experiments, long-term trials, pan-European surveys and targeted calcareous-grassland case studies, with an emphasis on **Central Europe** (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czechia, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, N-Italy, E-France, Belgium, Luxembourg). Manipulative and observational evidence are integrated, implications for conservation/restoration extracted, and research gaps highlighted.

## 2. Functional Guilds of Interest
1. **Symbiotic fungi**
   • Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) – *Glomeromycota*
   • Septate root endophytes – *Sebacinales*, *Helotiales*
2. **Rhizospheric N-fixers**
   • Rhizobiaceae (*Rhizobium*, *Bradyrhizobium*, *Mesorhizobium*)
   • Free-living diazotrophs (*Azotobacter*, *Frankia*)
3. **Saprotrophic & pathogen-suppressive bacteria/fungi**
4. **Soil meso- and macrofauna**
   • Nematodes, microarthropods, earthworms – trophic cascading on microbes and litter
5. **Pathogens** (*Rhizoctonia*, *Pythium*, *Fusarium*, bacterial wilts) – negative feedback driving coexistence.

## 3. Abiotic Template of Central-European Calcareous Soils
Calcareous rendzinas combine:
• High base saturation & pH 6.8–8.2  → phosphate sorption, micronutrient imbalances (Fe, Mn, Zn)
• Low organic-matter (2–6 % C), shallow depth (10–40 cm)
• Seasonal water stress (rapid percolation, thin A-horizon)
These constraints shape microbial stoichiometry (low C:N ≈ 8–12) and select for **oligotrophic bacterial taxa** (e.g. *Gemmatimonas*, *Nitrosospira*) and calcium-tolerant AMF lineages (*Claroideoglomus*, *Septoglomus*).

## 4. Empirical Evidence Linking Soil Biota to Plant Diversity

### 4.1 Manipulative Field Experiments
| Region & Substrate | Design & Duration | Key Biotic Findings | Plant Diversity Outcome |
|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Belgian Calcareous Grasslands** (Hesbaye Plateau dolomite) | Coppice removal → grassland restoration plots (n = 18, 0–15 yr; Mertens et al., 2019) | *Rapid convergence* of bulk soil N, P, K to reference within 5–8 yr; however microbial extracellular-enzyme activity (N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, acid phosphatase) lagged → **depressed mineralisation** | Floristic similarity reached only 62 % after 15 yr; delayed specialist forbs recruitment linked to low N-mineralisation & AMF inoculum scarcity |
| **Rhizoctonia suppressiveness trial** (CZ, AT, DE) | Grassland vs arable soils (16 sites); maize bioassay | Permanent grassland soils displayed **higher bacterial evenness** (DGGE) and slower *R. solani* hyphal extension | Suppressiveness correlated (r = 0.71) with plot-level plant species richness – supports pathogen‐mediated negative feedbacks aiding coexistence |
| **Hay-cut & Inoculation – N England (MG3b analogue on limestone till)** | 21 Jul cut + legume/Rhinanthus seed mixture; 14 yr | Fungal:bacterial PLFA ↑ 1.8×; AMF hyphal length density doubled | Species richness rose from 12 → 38 m⁻²; community converged on target meadow within ≤10 yr |

**Insights**:
• Targeted seeding of hemi-parasite *Rhinanthus minor* weakened dominant grasses, *indirectly* raising forb diversity by modifying root biomass and rhizosphere carbon fluxes; the manoeuvre works best when mycorrhizal inocula are ample.
• **Soil microbial functional recovery precedes, but does not guarantee, above-ground species assembly**; inoculation of late-successional AMF/rare diazotrophs may shorten the bottleneck.

### 4.2 Pan-European Surveys Relevant to Limestone Contexts
1. **PLFA transect (Sweden→Portugal):** Fungal biomarkers respond strongly to management intensity; calcareous grasslands under *extensive* regimes displayed the **highest saprotrophic fungal abundance**, which positively correlated with forb richness (ρ = 0.45) after correcting for pH.
2. **β-diversity cross-continental synthesis (145 plots, 4 continents):** Plant turnover is a *strong predictor* of bacterial & fungal turnover independent of edaphic variation. Limestone plots fell at upper quartile of both plant and microbial β-diversity → underscores tight plant–microbe co-sorting along the calcareous edaphic niche.
3. **715-soil Atlas:** Grasslands/croplands hold higher microbial α-diversity than forests; however limestone grasslands contain **disproportionate fractions of fungal symbionts** and *Gemmatimonadetes* (adapted to low P availability).

### 4.3 Long-Term Agronomic Trials on Calcareous Derivatives
• **Skierniewice 100-yr luvisol trial (high CaCO₃ 8 %):** Organic amendments ↑ *Actinobacteria* (cellulose decomposers) and diversified N-cycling genes; no-plough regimes ↓ nitrifiers (*Nitrospirae*). Such shifts alter nitrate availability and can tip competitive hierarchies among calcicole forbs.

## 5. Mechanistic Pathways
1. **Mycorrhiza-mediated P scavenging**
   • Calcareous soils lock P as Ca-phosphates; AMF extend exploitation radius and secrete acid phosphatase.
   • Specialist calcicole forbs (e.g. *Gentianella germanica*, *Thesium linophyllon*) show mycorrhizal dependency indices >60 %. Absence/delay of matching AMF morphotypes retards their establishment during restoration.
2. **Symbiotic N-fixation & Stoichiometric Balancing**
   • Legume abundance (clovers, *Onobrychis*, *Lotus*) often limits total N. In the Dutch 16-yr study, Trifolium addition sequestered 317 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹—elevated C:N ratio maintained forb niches by preventing grass over-dominance.
3. **Pathogen Accumulation & Negative Plant–Soil Feedbacks (NPSF)**
   • High host specificity of calcareous pathogens (*Olpidium brassicae*, *Rhizoctonia* lineages) generates density-dependent mortality, stabilising coexistence.
4. **Soil Fauna as Microbial Architects**
   • Microarthropods graze fungal hyphae, stimulating compensatory exudation and increasing labile C in the rhizosphere, which promotes beneficial bacteria (contrarian view: high grazing may suppress AMF networks). Earthworm casts on shallow rendzinas create micro-hotspots of neutral pH and available P.

## 6. Management & Restoration Implications
1. **Define a Microbial Reference:** Baseline calcareous grasslands exhibit (i) F:B PLFA ratio ≈ 1.2–1.5, (ii) AMF spore richness 12–18 OTUs/50 g soil, (iii) diazotrophic nifH copy numbers >2 × 10⁸ g⁻¹. Restoration success metrics should include these.
2. **Propagule Steering**
   • *On-site soil transfer* (15 mm donor turf) supplies whole microbiome but risks weeds; *AMF trap-cultures* ensure traceability.
3. **Hay-Cut Scheduling**
   • Mid-July cut (not June) maximises forb seed rain yet allows AMF carbon allocation before photosynthate removal.
4. **Native Bio-inoculant Development**
   • Combine culture-dependent & ‑independent QC (Bright-field + SEM + NGS). The main error source remains **improper soil sampling**—use spatially stratified cores.
5. **Phosphate Management**
   • Avoid any P addition; instead co-apply Fe/Al oxide fines (industrial by-product) to tie up excess P where legacy fertiliser loads threaten calcicolous specialists (unconventional but field-tested in Franconian Jura; speculative flag).
6. **Pathogen Biocontrol via Diversity Seeds**
   • Introduce forb seed mixtures that host distinct root exudates; greater chemical diversity suppresses generalist pathogens.
7. **Digital Twin Modelling** (emerging tool)
   • Pair eddy-covariance C-flux towers with metagenomic time-series to predict plant community shifts under climate change (speculation but pilots running in Swiss Jura).

## 7. Contrarian & Emerging Ideas
• **Carbon-ate Weathering Enhancement:** Grinding and broadcasting silicate fines on calcareous grasslands could (i) draw down CO₂, (ii) acidify micro-zones, temporarily increasing P solubility—may favour early-successional forbs but risk grass surge. Requires microcosm tests.
• **Phage Therapy for Rhizosphere Engineering:** Tailored bacteriophage cocktails to knock back *Pseudomonas* pathovars implicated in *Gentianella* decline (lab evidence only). Flagged as speculative.

## 8. Knowledge Gaps & Future Research Priorities
1. **Trait-based Matching of AMF & Calcicole Hosts** – need phylogenetic-functional linkage maps.
2. **Quantification of Protist & Viral Roles** – almost no data from limestone systems.
3. **Long-term (>25 yr) Microbial Succession Trajectories** – existing chronosequences rarely exceed 15 yr.
4. **Interactive Climate × Biota Effects** – drought–re-wet pulses on thin rendzinas likely restructure microbial networks; lacks manipulative tests.
5. **Scaling from Micro-patch to Landscape** – use eDNA with distributed autonomous sensors.

---

## 9. Key Take-Home Messages
• Soil biota exert **multi-layered control** over plant diversity on Central-European calcareous soils via nutrient acquisition, pathogen feedback and carbon cycling.
• Fungal guilds—both mutualists and saprotrophs—are **particularly sensitive to management** and can be leveraged through hay-cut scheduling and inoculation.
• Restoration trajectories are **bottlenecked by slow microbial functional recovery**, not merely by chemistry; targeted microbial amendments shorten this lag.
• Biodiversity outcomes are maximised when **plant species turnover is mirrored by microbial turnover**—hence seed mixes and soil inocula must be co-designed.
