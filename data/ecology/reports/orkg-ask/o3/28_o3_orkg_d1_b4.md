# Can Herbivory Modulate the Effects of Global Change on Plant Communities?  
### A Synthetic Review Integrating Empirical, Modeling and Theoretical Insights (2025)

---

## Executive Summary
Current evidence overwhelmingly shows that herbivores—ranging from soil‐dwelling wireworms through insect folivores to large ungulates—do far more than passively track global environmental change (GEC). Instead, they frequently *modulate*, *amplify*, *buffer* or even *reverse* the direct effects of elevated CO₂, warming, altered precipitation, nutrient deposition, land-use change and altered disturbance regimes on plant communities. Across 13 recent studies (2018-2024) spanning multiple continents, biomes and trophic levels we find four recurrent themes:

1. **Stoichiometric and Nutrient Feedbacks**: Herbivore presence can flip the direction of soil C / N responses to fertilization or atmospheric deposition, generating outcomes opposite to prevailing equilibrium theory (e.g., Nutrient Network and vertebrate-exclosure experiments).
2. **Transient Vegetation Dynamics Matter**: When vegetation change lags behind climate forcing, coupling herbivore–plant feedbacks into models can shrink projected alpine mammal range losses by 60 %. Ignoring the transient dimension yields systematically pessimistic forecasts.
3. **Climate–Herbivore Interactions Are Highly Trait- and Guild-Specific**: Warming suppresses invertebrate herbivory directly along an elevation gradient, yet indirectly raises it by eroding phylogenetic plant diversity; conversely, heavy rainfall pulses can switch below-ground–above-ground interactions from facilitation to suppression within weeks.
4. **Landscape Heterogeneity and Management Intensity Modulate Outcomes**: Silvopastoral models and fire–grazing simulations show that stocking density, grazer selectivity and disturbance feedbacks jointly determine whether global change homogenises or diversifies vegetation mosaics.

Collectively, these findings call for a paradigm shift: *any attempt to forecast or manage plant community responses to global change that ignores herbivory is likely to be wrong in magnitude, direction—or both.*

## 1. Introduction
Global change research traditionally treats herbivores as external stressors that additively reduce plant biomass. Yet herbivores alter nutrient cycling, selective pressures, microclimate and disturbance regimes, thereby feeding back into plant community trajectories under the six dominant anthropogenic drivers (elevated CO₂, warming, precipitation change, N enrichment, land-use change and altered disturbance regimes such as fire). Here we synthesise evidence across herbivore guilds (large mammals, above-ground insects, below-ground invertebrates) and evidence types (manipulative experiments, continental observational networks, next-generation dynamic vegetation models) to answer: *Can herbivory modulate the effects of global change on plant communities?* The short answer is yes—often in ways that violate first-order expectations from classic plant ecology.

## 2. Mechanistic Pathways of Modulation
### 2.1 Stoichiometric Feedbacks and Nutrient Cycling
• **Young Vertebrate Exclosures (6–8 yr, N. America & Europe)**: Herbivore removal *decreased* soil resin-extractable N where ambient plant N concentration was high, but *increased* it where plant N was low—opposite to prevailing stoichiometric models assuming equilibrium (Learning 1). This suggests rapid, non-equilibrium nutrient drawdown when herbivores are removed from N-rich sites, likely via increased plant uptake and microbial immobilisation.

• **Global Grassland Nutrient Network (22 sites)**: Under ambient nutrients, excluding large herbivores left soil C/N unchanged; under NPK+micronutrient addition, exclusion *reduced* soil C and N pools, whereas grazed+fertilised plots stored the most C/N (Learning 5). Direction of grazer impact flipped with mean annual temperature—losses in cold sites, gains in warm ones—indicating a strong climate × nutrient × herbivore interaction controlling below-ground carbon sequestration.

### 2.2 Vegetation Dynamics and Successional Trajectories
• **Alpine Chamois Model Coupling**: Climate-only projections predicted an 80 % range loss by 2100, but incorporating transient vegetation dynamics plus forage feedbacks cut the decline to 20 % (Learning 2). Herbivory therefore dampened apparent climate impacts by tracking shifting plant resources, delaying shrub encroachment and facilitating lagged colonisation.

• **WoodPaM Silvopastoral Model**: A modest +1 °C per century drives closed-forest takeover unless low stocking density with high selectivity is maintained (Learning 4). Herbivores sustain open-wooded mosaics under warming by targeting competitive woody recruits; high stocking, low selectivity homogenises the system.

### 2.3 Trait-Mediated Plant Defence and Microclimate
• **Rain Pulse Experiment (Spain)**: +30 % rainfall pulses halved biomass and floral output of *Moricandia moricandioides* and reversed wireworm–chewing insect interactions from facilitation to suppression (Learning 3). Moisture stress altered root exudates, thereby changing below-ground herbivore behaviour and cascading above-ground.

• **Simulated Downpours on Brassicaceous Hosts**: Short, intense rains killed *Plutella xylostella* but not *Pieris brassicae*; both experienced slower development due to 5 °C canopy cooling; plant chemical shifts were minor (Learning 9). Herbivore vulnerability therefore depends on cuticular hydrophobicity and thermal thresholds more than host chemistry.

### 2.4 Trophic Cascades and Top-Down Control
• **Multifactor Grassland Experiment**: Warming quadrupled, and N deposition doubled, total herbivore biomass while parasitoids remained static, yielding herbivore-dominated communities (Learning 10). Loss of top-down control under combined drivers corroborates theory predicting outbreak risk when herbivore thermal or nutrient optima exceed those of their enemies.

• **Barley Mesocosms Under Drought vs. Drought/Deluge**: Continuous drought reduced plant mass and weakened wireworm impact; drought/deluge left biomass constant but boosted aphids +15 % and their ladybird predators +66 % (Learning 12). Pulsed precipitation thus propagated upward cascades across three trophic levels via phloem chemistry.

### 2.5 Spatial Heterogeneity and Landscape-Scale Feedbacks
• **FireBGCv2 + GrazeBGC**: Even with highest grazing pressure, total carbon fluxes and area burned remained climate-dominated; but grazer inclusion altered shrub & herb biomass, fireline intensity and smoke emissions (Learning 11). Herbivores therefore modulate disturbance severity more than frequency.

• **UK Calcareous Grassland Resurveys**: Despite conservation grazing, ≥15 yr of chronic N deposition cut Shannon diversity and rare species richness; structural equation modelling indicated *direct* N effects overshadowed herbivore mediation (Learning 7). In high‐N systems, grazing alone cannot compensate for atmospheric inputs.

## 3. Modulation Across Global Change Drivers
### 3.1 Elevated CO₂
A cross-system meta-analysis indicates that elevated CO₂ uniformly *increases* herbivory, particularly by generalist feeders, across both managed and wild plants (Learning 6). Enhanced C assimilation loosens carbon limitation, dilutes N in tissues, and stimulates compensatory feeding. Thus, CO₂ enrichment often *amplifies* herbivore pressure, which can counteract CO₂-induced plant growth gains.

### 3.2 Warming
Empirical patterns remain mixed. Along a 1,101 m gradient warmer temperatures reduced invertebrate herbivory directly (thermal stress) but raised it indirectly via decreased plant phylogenetic diversity (Learning 8), highlighting community-context dependence. Modeling (WoodPaM, Alpine chamois) suggests herbivores can mitigate warming-driven vegetation closure by preferential browsing/grazing on woody encroachers. Yet warming can also decouple parasitoid control, risking outbreak (Learning 10).

### 3.3 Altered Precipitation
Rainfall variability alters herbivory via direct mortality, microclimate cooling, and plant chemistry (Learning 3, 9, 12). Pulsed regimes often intensify above-ground insect herbivory and can flip below-ground interactions, whereas sustained drought can dampen herbivore impact by reducing host quality and herbivore survival. Trait specificity (cuticle hydrophobicity, developmental rate) governs winner–loser dynamics.

### 3.4 Nitrogen Deposition and Nutrient Enrichment
Chronic N deposition depresses plant diversity even under active grazing (Learning 7). However, *interactive* fertilisation experiments reveal that large grazers can offset fertilisation-induced soil C/N losses (Learning 5). Thus herbivory can be either compensatory (maintaining soil C/N) or insufficient (biodiversity loss) depending on deposition intensity, temperature and management regime.

### 3.5 Land-Use Change & Disturbance Regimes
Herbivores shape vegetation mosaics under land-use intensification and fire. Grazing selectivity controls whether warming transforms wood-pastures into closed forest (Learning 4); in fire-prone systems, herbivores mainly modulate fire intensity rather than area burned, with climate and suppression efficacy dominating total fluxes (Learning 11). Ignoring herbivores in carbon and smoke forecasting models thus misrepresents disturbance severity.

## 4. Herbivory Types and Biome Contexts
1. **Large Vertebrates (Ungulates, Livestock)** – Key for soil C/N feedbacks, maintaining open habitats, moderating fire intensity. Effects scale with stocking density, selectivity and nutrient context.
2. **Above-Ground Insects** – Rapidly responsive to CO₂, temperature and precipitation pulses; mediate top-down cascades; outbreak potential under combined warming-nutrient scenarios.
3. **Below-Ground Herbivores** – Wireworms and root feeders interact strongly with moisture regimes and can flip facilitative vs. suppressive roles after precipitation change (Learning 3, 12).
4. **Multi-Guild Interactions** – Precipitation or warming often alters the balance among guilds, e.g., insect parasitoids lag behind herbivores under warming, shifting trophic structure (Learning 10).

Biome-specificity remains high: cold grasslands show grazer-induced soil C/N loss under fertilisation, warm grasslands show gain; alpine systems rely on herbivory to buffer shrub expansion; Mediterranean shrublands exhibit moisture-driven sign reversals in below-ground–above-ground interactions.

## 5. Synthesis: A Typology of Modulation
We propose four non-exclusive categories:
1. **Amplification** – Herbivory strengthens GEC effects (e.g., elevated CO₂ → higher herbivory → greater tissue loss).
2. **Buffering/Dampening** – Herbivores offset GEC (e.g., alpine chamois browsing delays climate-induced shrub takeover; grazing maintains soil C/N under fertilisation in warm sites).
3. **Reversal** – Direction of change flips (e.g., rainfall pulses flip wireworm facilitation to suppression; nutrient addition + grazer exclusion reverses soil C/N responses).
4. **Contingency** – Outcome depends on trait filters or environmental context (e.g., temperature‐mediated shift from functional to phylogenetic diversity control of herbivory).

## 6. Emerging Technologies & Contrarian Angles
• **eDNA & Metabarcoding** now allow diet reconstruction for elusive herbivores, capturing trophic shifts under GEC in near real time.
• **High-frequency Drone LiDAR** can quantify canopy structural changes from intense insect herbivory before visual symptoms appear.
• **Edge-AI Sensors on Livestock** provide grazer selectivity data to parameterise models like WoodPaM, turning traditional pastoral systems into living laboratories.
• **Stoichiometric Metamodels** question equilibrium assumptions, advocating transient flux monitoring (soil probes, stable isotopes) during the first decade after herbivore removal.
• **Contrarian Idea**: Intentional rewilding with megaherbivores in nutrient-polluted temperate zones could *increase* native plant diversity by selectively feeding on nitrophilous competitors—an untested but theoretically plausible outcome demanding adaptive experimentation.

## 7. Management Implications & Policy Guidance
1. **Integrate Herbivore Feedbacks into Climate Adaptation Planning**: Alpine protected areas should manage browser densities to preserve forage-mediated buffering of range loss.
2. **Couple Grazing Regimes with Fertiliser Policy**: In warm grasslands, allowing moderate grazing under fertilisation maximises soil C sequestration—counterintuitive to current exclusionary carbon credit schemes.
3. **Disturbance-Informed Stocking**: Fire-prone landscapes require herbivore densities calibrated not to area burned but to desired flame length thresholds for safe suppression.
4. **Precipitation Variability Forecasting**: Agroecosystems should plan cultivar choice and pest management around trait-specific vulnerabilities (cuticular hydrophobicity, thermal tolerances) under projected rain event statistics.
5. **N Deposition Targets Must Recognise Grazing Limits**: Conservation grazing cannot fully counteract chronic atmospheric inputs; emission reductions remain non-negotiable for biodiversity.

---

## 8. Key Research Gaps & Priorities (2025-2030)
• **Temporal Lag Quantification**: Multi-decadal exclosure chronosequences to capture transitions from transient to equilibrium nutrient states.
• **Model–Experiment Fusion**: Iteratively update dynamic vegetation–herbivore models with real-time remote sensing and eDNA diet data.
• **Cross-Guild Multi-Factor Experiments**: Factorial warming × CO₂ × precipitation × nutrient × herbivory to parse higher-order interactions driving outbreak risk.
• **Socio-Ecological Scenarios**: Integrate livestock economics and cultural grazing practices into land management models like FireBGC-GrazeBGC.
• **Below-Ground–Above-Ground Linkages**: Resolve mechanism of precipitation-driven interaction flips via root exudate metabolomics and soil microbiome profiling.

## 9. Speculative Outlook (Flagged as High Uncertainty)
1. **Herbivore-Driven Geo-Bioengineering**: Strategic deployment of large herbivores in high-latitude peatlands may offset methane release by maintaining sedge-moss dominance—a hypothesis needing field trials.
2. **CRISPR-Based Plant Defence Tuning**: Editing decoy receptors could render staple crops less palatable under elevated CO₂ while maintaining yield, potentially recalibrating herbivore pressure globally.
3. **AI-Optimised Dynamic Stocking**: Real-time satellite + wearable sensor data could allow autonomously controlled flock movements to track rapidly changing forage quality under extreme weather, reducing overgrazing hotspots.

---

## 10. Conclusion
Across ecosystems, herbivores are neither mere passengers nor simple drivers but *dynamic moderators* of global change effects on plant communities. Stoichiometric feedbacks, transient vegetation dynamics, trait-mediated interactions and landscape heterogeneity produce context-dependent outcomes that can amplify, buffer, reverse, or render contingent the plant community responses to climate, CO₂, precipitation, nutrients and land-use change. Incorporating herbivory into experimental designs, long-term monitoring and process-based models is no longer optional—it is essential for accurate forecasting and effective management in the Anthropocene.
