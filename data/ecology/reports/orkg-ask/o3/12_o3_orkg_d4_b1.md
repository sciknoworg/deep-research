# Impacts of Buckthorn Invasion on Biodiversity – An Integrated Technical Review

*Focal taxa:*  
• Common buckthorn *Rhamnus cathartica* L.  
• Glossy buckthorn *Frangula (=Rhamnus) alnus* Mill.  
*Core ecosystems addressed:* Temperate hardwood and mixed-conifer forests of the Upper Midwest/Northeast USA and south-eastern Canada, plus experimental grassland mesocosms.

## 1. Context and Motivation
Buckthorns are among the most aggressive woody invaders of North American forests and wetlands. Their impacts have usually been framed in terms of overstory regeneration failure and mid-story thicket formation. A decade of new work, however, reveals a more complex picture in which buckthorn functions as an ecosystem engineer, forming self-reinforcing feedbacks with exotic earthworms, altered nutrient cycles, and disturbance regimes. The resulting cascade influences multiple, partially decoupled dimensions of biodiversity: taxonomic richness, phylogenetic breadth, functional diversity, microbial guild structure, and soil-fauna assemblages.

The present report synthesises **all available mechanistic lines of evidence** (experimental, observational, tracer-based, and management trials) and identifies practical leverage points. Where necessary, I extend the logic chain with clearly flagged hypotheses (*speculative*).

## 2. Mechanisms of Impact
### 2.1 Intrinsic buckthorn traits
1. **Shade tolerance** jointly with **high maximum photosynthetic rates** → persistence across a broad light gradient.
2. **Bird-dispersed, lipid-rich fruit** → long‐distance spread, especially along edge habitats.
3. **Extended leaf phenology** (leaf-out ±20 d earlier and leaf-drop ±30 d later than co-occurring natives) → lengthened period of C gain and litter deposition while neighbours are dormant.
4. **High foliar N (~3.0 %) and low C:N litter** → rapid decomposition, flushes of mineral N in early spring (Knight et al. 2007 review).
5. **Root exudate profile** (coumarins, emodin) with mild allelopathic potential.

Collectively these traits pre-adapt buckthorn to colonise disturbed microsites and, once established, to **shift resource availability and microbial activity in its own favour**.

### 2.2 Synergy with non-native earthworms – the co-invasion feedback
Greenhouse factorials manipulating light, litter depth, and earthworm presence converge on a striking result: **earthworms triple *R. cathartica* seedling density and biomass regardless of the above-ground environment** (learning #7 & #10). Mechanistic pathways include:

• Litter displacement → seed–soil contact, higher germination.  
• Enhanced soil moisture retention in worm-worked microsites.  
• Elevated inorganic N (up to 1.8× control) via fast turnover of low C:N litter and gut passage.  

Conversely, buckthorn’s high-quality litter **feeds worm populations**, closing a positive feedback.

## 3. Dimensions of Biodiversity Affected
### 3.1 Vascular plant layer
#### 3.1.1 Species richness & regeneration failure
• In four southern-NH Pinus–mixed hardwood stands, 2 × 2 m plots showed that *F. alnus* basal area alone explained more variance in woody seedling density than canopy openness, soil pH, or texture; **seedling density, herb cover, and total species richness declined 30–60 % along the buckthorn gradient** (Webb et al. 2001; learning #2).

• Across 24 oak forests in Minnesota, **phylogenetic diversity—not raw species richness—best predicted low *R. cathartica* abundance**. Canopy gaps and bare soil (often earthworm-generated) facilitated buckthorn (learning #6). This suggests management must target community composition, not simply richness counts.

• Spring‐ephemeral herbs (*Trillium*, *Uvularia*, *Viola*) decline 30–50 % in stands simultaneously invaded by European earthworms (learning #4). While worms are the proximal driver (O-horizon loss, soil compaction), buckthorn accelerates worm establishment, so the composite invasion amplifies understory collapse.

#### 3.1.2 Functional & phylogenetic diversity
Buckthorn thickets simplify **functional trait space** by excluding slow-growing, low‐plasticity, mycorrhiza-dependent herbs and shrubs, while favouring fast-cycling, shade-tolerant graminoids and opportunistic forbs. The resulting community is dominated by a **narrower evolutionary slice** (mostly rosids and asterids), reducing redundancy and adaptive capacity.

### 3.2 Soil microbial community
Multiple tracer studies (learnings #1 & #3) indicate that worm-dominated buckthorn stands retain microbial N yet lose soil C:

• **Microbial biomass N up 13–26 %.**  
• **Potential net N-mineralisation down 20–40 %.**  
• 13C/15N from fresh litter is incorporated more rapidly into microbial pools, but total C storage drops by 30–40 %.

Interpretation: Buckthorn litter supplies easily decomposable substrates; earthworms mix it into the mineral horizon, triggering a **“boom–bust” microbe cycle** – rapid immobilisation followed by cohort turnover and nitrate pulses, explaining elevated NO₃⁻ leaching (learning #4). Result: **microbial ‘carrying capacity’ expands for N but not for C**, altering stoichiometry for downstream consumers.

### 3.3 Soil fauna
Earthworm assemblages shift from native or absent toward **European endogeic → anecic dominance** (*Lumbricus rubellus*, *L. terrestris*). Liming experiments (learnings #8 & #11) demonstrate that even previously earthworm-resistant podzols can become invasion hot-spots once forest managers attempt Ca recovery for sugar maple. *Management implication:* Lime application can inadvertently unlock buckthorn–worm co-invasion fronts.

Additional faunal consequences (largely *speculative* due to limited empirical data):
1. **Collembola & oribatid mites** decline as O-horizon disappears; alters litter breakdown pathways.  
2. **Ground beetle assemblages** shift toward open-habitat species; predation pressure on some seeds and invertebrates changes.  
3. **Amphibian foraging success** may drop with leaf-litter loss, though moisture retention in worm-casts could partially offset this.

### 3.4 Above-ground invertebrates & vertebrates
Data remain sparse, but likely trajectories include:
• Reduced structural complexity → fewer web-building spiders and foliage-gleaning birds.  
• Buckthorn fruits attract frugivores, possibly subsidising bird populations that disseminate additional invasives (*speculative*).  
• Chemical composition of fruit (emodin) can act as a laxative, shortening gut retention time and aiding long-distance dispersal, with unknown impacts on bird gut microbiomes.

## 4. Ecosystem-level Consequences
1. **Nutrient cycling acceleration** – net mineralisation pulses, but longer-term N retained in microbial biomass; risk of early-season nitrate leaching.  
2. **Carbon stock depletion** – 30–40 % O-horizon C loss when worms present; buckthorn facilitates this by supplying low-lignin litter.  
3. **Shift from mor to mull humus** – thinner litter (≤2 cm), higher bulk density, higher pH, accelerating further worm/buckthorn establishment.  
4. **Hydrological change** – increased infiltration via bioturbation yet reduced water storage capacity; may intensify drought sensitivity for residual flora.  
5. **Feedback loops** – Positive buckthorn–worm–nutrient cycling loop; lime addition or canopy disturbances can push systems past invasion thresholds.

## 5. Management Implications and Novel Leverage Points
### 5.1 Conventional measures
• *Mechanical removal* (cut-stump, basal bark herbicide) is effective but labour-intensive and must be coupled with:  
  – Restoration plantings of shade-tolerant natives with **wide phylogenetic dispersion** (learning #6 finding) to resist recolonisation.  
• *Prescribed fire*: limited efficacy under closed canopy; risk of stimulating seed release if not paired with follow-up treatments.
• *Chemical control*: glyphosate or triclopyr; non-target effects need accounting.

### 5.2 Integration of earthworm context – often overlooked
1. **Minimise forest-floor liming** unless essential; explore foliar Ca-Mg fertilisation as a low-soil disturbance alternative.  
2. **Target high-N litter interception** – Deploy **litter fences or straw additions** temporarily to raise C:N, dampening worm population growth (*experimental but promising*).  
3. **Encourage coarse woody debris retention** to rebuild physical barriers against earthworm mixing and provide microsites for slow-establishing herbs.

### 5.3 Manipulating microbial legacies (*emerging, speculative*)
• Biochar additions could re-complex mineral N and rebuild C stocks, making the system less favourable to buckthorn.  
• Introduction of *Entomopathogenic nematodes* or microbial worm pathogens (e.g., *Vairimorpha duboscqui*) may selectively curb earthworm biomass, but regulatory and ethical hurdles are high.

### 5.4 Functional diversification plantings
Results from the Jena experiment (learning #12) indicate that higher plant functional group richness feeds back to lower worm dominance via altered litter stoichiometry. *Recommendation:* Post-buckthorn removal, **seed a mixture of legumes, grasses, and slow-decomposing forbs** to dilute high-N litter and re-stabilise nutrient cycling.

## 6. Decision Tree for Practitioners
1. **Is earthworm biomass >200 g m⁻²?**  
   – Yes → Implement C-rich mulch, limit disturbance, monitor NO₃⁻ leaching.  
   – No → Focus on buckthorn stem removal and phylogenetic planting mixes.
2. **Is O-horizon thickness <3 cm?**  
   – Yes → Prioritise ground layer restoration and moisture retention (logs, nurse stumps).  
3. **Has the stand been limed or scheduled for liming?**  
   – If yes, weigh Ca recovery against invasion risk; consider targeted canopy injections instead.

---

## 7. Research Gaps & Opportunities
1. **Longitudinal paired‐catchment studies** tying buckthorn removal to watershed-scale N export.  
2. **Metagenomic profiling** to map shifts in fungal vs. bacterial guilds under co-invasion.  
3. **Trait‐based reassembly models** – predict which native assemblages best resist re-invasion given altered soil templates.  
4. **Biological control feasibility** – exploration of specialist rust fungi (*Puccinia coronata* races) or seed predators.  
5. **Socio-ecological incentives** – cost-sharing frameworks that account for nutrient retention and carbon credits post-restoration.

---

## 8. Key Take-Home Messages
• Buckthorn’s impact is magnified—not merely additive—when co-occurring with exotic earthworms.  
• Biodiversity loss extends beyond plant richness to **phylogenetic and functional erosion**, microbial stoichiometric shifts, and soil fauna simplification.  
• Management must address underlying **soil process alterations**, not just above-ground stems, to avoid rapid reinvasion.  
• Maintaining or restoring **phylogenetically diverse understories** and curbing disturbances that increase light and bare soil are cost-effective, evidence-backed levers.  
• Liming programs aimed at forest health can inadvertently tip systems into a buckthorn–worm positive feedback; alternative Ca supplementation approaches warrant urgent testing.
