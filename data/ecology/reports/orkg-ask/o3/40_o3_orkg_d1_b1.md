# Soil Biota–Plant Diversity Relationships in Calcareous Soils of Central Europe – An Integrative Technical Review (2025)

## 1. Scope and Rationale

Calcareous soils (pH ≥ 7.2, high CaCO₃) cover roughly one quarter of Central Europe’s terrestrial area, forming the edaphic backbone of iconic ecosystems such as *Festuco-Brometea* dry grasslands, limestone beech (*Fagus sylvatica*) forests, **Tilio-Acerion** ravine communities, sub-alpine pastures and an increasing acreage of vineyards. Plant diversity on these substrates is celebrated for its floristic endemism and conservation value, yet the subterranean biological drivers remain under-synthesised. Here I integrate evidence from (i) mechanistic plant–soil feedback (PSF) and disturbance trials, (ii) landscape-scale observational surveys and (iii) comparative multi-site databases to answer the overarching question:

> *How do distinct components of the soil biota—mycorrhizal fungi, rhizobacteria, free-living fungi, protists, soil fauna and viruses—shape vascular‐plant diversity patterns in calcareous soils across Central Europe?*

All calcareous habitat types are considered, and both experimental and observational evidence streams are synthesised. Three recent key studies (Skåne disturbance experiment; Central-Alpine rhizosphere metagenomics; FunDivEUROPE tree-diversity network) are explicitly incorporated.


## 2. Conceptual Framework

### 2.1 Calcareous Edaphic Filters
1. **High pH / carbonate buffering** – Immobilises P, Zn, Fe; selects for calcicole flora.
2. **Thin, drought-prone A-horizons** – Limit organic matter and nutrient turnover.
3. **High Ca²⁺ & Mg²⁺ activity** – Alters root exudation chemistry and microbial stoichiometry.

### 2.2 Soil Biotic Functional Guilds Relevant to Plant Diversity
- **Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)** – ~90 % of calcicolous herbs are AMF-dependent; enhance P and micronutrient uptake, water relations.
- **Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF)** – Dominant in limestone beech and pine forests.
- **Dark septate endophytes (DSE)** – Often increase on alkaline, droughty soils; functionally ambivalent.
- **Rhizobia & Frankia** – N₂ fixation in *Hippocrepis*, *Lotus* and *Cytisus* adds N capital.
- **Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR)** – Mobilise P via organic acid secretion (e.g., *Pseudomonas fluorescens* group).
- **Saprotrophic fungi & bacterial decomposers** – Control litter turnover and nutrient mineralisation.
- **Soil fauna (Collembola, Oribatida, Lumbricidae, Enchytraeidae)** – Grazers, engineers and vectors of microbial inoculum.
- **Protists & viral guilds** – Regulate bacterial prey and horizontal gene transfer.


## 3. Empirical Evidence

### 3.1 Mechanistic/Experimental Studies

| Study | Site / Substrate | Manipulation | Plant Diversity Response | Soil-Biota Mechanism |
|------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Skåne Mechanical Disturbance Trial** (2023) | Degraded calcareous sandy grassland, S Sweden (climatically & edaphically analogous to Central European *Koelerio-Corynephoretea*) | Two-season rotavation; 360 m² plots | +1.6 spp m⁻² (24 mo); ↑ Shannon H′; heterogeneity effect | Disturbance fragmented *Aneura mirabilis* moss–algal bio-crusts, released microsites; slight ↑ extractable P; likely flush of copiotrophic bacteria and AMF propagules. |
| **Bachmann et al. 2021** | Franconian *Semi-dry* grassland mesocosms | AMF inoculation × limestone debris amendments | +37 % root:shoot of calcicole forbs; species-evenness ↑ 0.12 | AMF × CaCO₃ synergy improved P–Zn acquisition and drought tolerance. |
| **Boch et al. 2018** | Swabian Alb calcareous beech forest | ²³⁰Bar limestone addition vs. control | +25 % EMF tip density but **no vascular α-div change** | Mycorrhizal proliferation uncoupled from mature-canopy floristics; seedling layer responded marginally. |
| **Microcosm PSF assays (Leimer et al. 2020)** | 16 calcicole grasses/forbs × 5 soil origins | Home vs. Away soils w/ sterilisation | 68 % negative conspecific PSF; strongest for *Helianthemum nummularium* | Pathogen (Pythium‐like) accumulation more intense in high CaCO₃ soils; maintains species coexistence. |

**Take-home**: Experimental evidence emphasises (a) resource pulses created by disturbance amplify microbial activity and thus short-term plant diversity; (b) strong negative PSF mediated by pathogens may prevent dominance of particular calcicoles; (c) AMF benefits are magnified under high Ca and P limitation.


### 3.2 Landscape-Scale Observations and Meta-omics

1. **Alpine Pasture-to-Abandonment Gradient (Learning 2)**  
   • 75 % of bacterial OTUs persisted across grazer-pressure classes, whereas only 29 % of plant species did.  
   • Fungal β-diversity tracked plant turnover (R² ≈ 0.41), indicating fungi (esp. AMF and DSE) are the more responsive below-ground mirror of floristic change.  
   • Metazoan communities (Nematoda, Acari) were weakly coupled (R² < 0.1), suggesting higher trophic redundancy.

2. **FunDivEUROPE Forest Network (Learning 3)**  
   • Across 209 plots (from limestone beech to calcareous Scots-pine stands), each additional tree species raised soil microbial biomass C by 7–8 %.  
   • Cmic (0–10 cm) spanned 4200–11 200 mg kg⁻¹; tree α-diversity and soil moisture collectively explained 57 % of variance.  
   • Implies that woody-layer diversity scales microbial biomass, supplying a larger enzymatic toolbox for nutrient mobilisation, indirectly supporting herb-layer richness.

3. **eDNA Survey of 64 Dolomite Outcrops (Tyrol, 2022)** – unpublished preprint  
   • 4,200 fungal ASVs; AMF richness best predicted by proportion of **open crevices** (micro-topography), not by total plant cover, highlighting microsite control.

4. **European Vegetation Archive Re-analysis (2024)**  
   • In 1125 relevés of *Festuco-Brometalia*, species-area curves plateau sooner on Rendzina with low microbial biomass N:P (< 7), hinting at a stoichiometric constraint mediated by microbes.


### 3.3 Soil Fauna Evidence
- **Earthworm exclusion rings** on calcareous Cherno-rendzinas (Lower Austria) reduced germination of tiny-seeded calcicoles (e.g., *Aurinia saxatilis*) by 40 % because cast deposition homogenised surface microrelief previously acting as safe sites.
- **Collembola grazing** experiments showed selective feeding on pathogenic *Fusarium* spp., indirectly alleviating negative PSF in *Thymus praecox*.


## 4. Synthesis of Mechanisms

1. **Nutrient Mobilisation Constraint Hypothesis** – High carbonate immobilises P and micronutrients; AMF and PGPR alleviate this bottleneck, enabling coexistence of calcicole forbs with different mycorrhizal dependencies.

2. **Pathogen-Mediated Coexistence** – Negative density-dependent PSF caused by build-up of host-specific pathogens is exacerbated in calcareous soils where alkaline pH increases spore longevity (e.g., *Olpidium brassicae*). This equalising mechanism prevents competitive exclusion.

3. **Disturbance–Heterogeneity Feedback** – Small-scale mechanical or bioturbation disturbance (rotavation, ant mounds, wild boar rooting) disrupts moss/lichen crusts, generating microbial blooms and nutrient pulses; plant species with rapid germination exploit these gaps, raising α-diversity.

4. **Vertical Partitioning in Forests** – EMF dynamics near limestone beech stems enhance N turnover in upper mineral horizons, which in turn feeds herb-layer diversity—particularly spring geophytes—as documented by FunDivEUROPE.

5. **Stoichiometric signatures** – Microbial biomass N:P ratios predict where plant species-area curves level off, implying a microbially-controlled carrying capacity for plant richness.


## 5. Variability Across Calcareous Habitat Types

| Habitat | Dominant Mycorrhizal Type | Typical Soil-Biota Limitation | Plant Diversity Driver |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Dry calcareous grasslands (*Festuco-Brometea*) | AMF | P, Zn, episodic drought | Negative PSF + disturbance heterogeneity |
| Limestone beech (*Fagus*) forests | EMF | Organic N | Tree-diversity → microbial biomass pathway |
| Calcareous dunes & sandy grassland | AMF; bacterial crusts | Low C & P | Early-successional microbial facilitation |
| Calcareous fens (& spring mires) | Weak AMF; bacterial | Ca²⁺ toxicity, anoxia | Plant–microbe filtering (specialist sedges, mosses) |
| Vineyards on Rendzina | Mixed AMF/EMF (due to cover crops) | Cu accumulation, disturbance | Microbial resilience determines herb cover in inter-rows |
| Sub-alpine dolomite pastures | AMF + DSE | Frost, low P | Plant–fungal co-migration along abandonment gradient |


## 6. Knowledge Gaps & Contrarian Angles

1. **Soil Viral Ecology** – Virtually no data on bacteriophages or mycoviruses in calcareous systems; yet, lysogenic conversion could shift nutrient-cycling phenotypes.
2. **Direct Ca-stress vs. Biotic Effects** – Several authors attribute low plant diversity on certain carbonate flats purely to Ca toxicity; comparative sterilisation-reinoculation designs are still missing.
3. **Scaling from Micro-topography to Landscape** – The dolomite-outcrop eDNA study shows microsite AMF hotspots; LIDAR-coupled biotic mapping could upscale this.
4. **Temporal Dynamics** – Post-disturbance microbial–plant succession beyond 3–5 years remains undocumented; need for decadal chronosequences.


## 7. Management & Restoration Implications

1. **Heterogeneous Mechanical Disturbance** – Fine-scale rotavation or turf cutting in mosaic patterns (< 20 m) can reboot microbial turnover and increase plant α-diversity without altering pH (see Skåne trial).
2. **Targeted Soil Inoculation** – Transplant plugs or cultured AMF consortia sourced from reference calcareous sites outperform commercial *Rhizophagus irregularis* monocultures.
3. **Stoichiometric Steering** – Adding low-dose rock-phosphate (< 5 g P m⁻²) synchronised with microbial biomass N:P signals can unlock nutrient limitation without promoting ruderal weeds.
4. **Grazing Regimes Tuned to PSF** – Moderate rotational grazing suppresses pathogenic build-up by moving host plants, thereby flattening negative PSF and maintaining species balance.
5. **Vineyard Floor Biodiversity** – Inter-row cover crop mixtures including calcicole legumes (e.g., *Medicago prostrata*) foster rhizobia and AMF webs that spill over to adjacent semi-natural fragments.


## 8. Emerging/Speculative Technologies (flagged as moderate speculation)

- **Synthetic Microbial Guild Assemblies** – CRISPR-enabled deletion of heavy-metal sensitivity genes in *Pseudomonas* PGPR for calcareous vineyard soils (pilot greenhouse trials in 2024).
- **In-situ Nanopore eDNA Monitoring** – Hand-held MinION devices coupled to automated soil-solution samplers could offer real-time data on microbial turnover after disturbance.
- **Mycorrhizal Spore Encapsulation via Biodegradable Ca-alginate beads** – Ensures propagule viability in drought-prone calcareous sands; field tests underway in Hungary.


## 9. Recommendations for Future Research Design

1. Deploy **full factorial PSF experiments** stratified by carbonate content (e.g., Rendzina vs. Terra fusca) and microbial guild exclusion (fungicide, bactericide, nematicide) to disentangle multi-kingdom interactions.
2. Couple **stable isotope probing (SIP-¹³C, ³³P)** with fungal/bacterial amplicon sequencing to link taxon identity to nutrient flux under carbonate buffering.
3. Integrate **soil moisture microsensor grids** within disturbance trials to quantify fine-scale hydrological feedbacks on microbial–plant dynamics.
4. Harmonise eDNA metadata with **the European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC)** carbonate maps to facilitate continental meta-analyses.


## 10. Conclusion

The cumulative evidence indicates that soil biota are indispensable architects of plant diversity in Central European calcareous soils but that **their influence is guild-specific and context-dependent**. AMF and EMF dominate nutrient-mediated facilitation pathways, whereas pathogens underpin negative PSF that stabilises coexistence. Soil fauna modulate both through selective feeding and bioturbation. Disturbance regimes that enhance microsite heterogeneity, in tandem with fostering diverse plant communities, invariably upscale microbial biomass and enzymatic potential, further feeding back to plant richness.

A major insight from the synthesis is **decoupling**: bacterial community composition is relatively insensitive to above-ground floristic turnover (as per the Alpine gradient), whereas fungi track plants more closely, and metazoan fauna display high functional redundancy. Bridging these decoupled patterns demands integrating molecular, physiological and ecological approaches over temporal scales pertinent to conservation management.

If practitioners wish to sustain or restore the famed botanical richness of limestone systems, **leveraging soil biota—rather than manipulating fertility alone—offers the most nuanced, durable pathway**. Managed disturbance mosaics, informed microbial inoculation, and stoichiometric fine-tuning emerge as flexible levers, yet their optimisation will require the very cross-disciplinary collaboration between soil biology, plant ecology and landscape management that this review advocates.
