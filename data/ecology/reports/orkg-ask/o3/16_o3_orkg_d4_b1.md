# Invasive Species, Pollination Networks, and Native Pollinators in Tropical Mountains – A Technical Synthesis

_Compiled 2025-06-02_

## 1  Scope and Objectives
Because the follow-up questions were left unanswered, this review adopts a **global perspective on tropical montane systems** (c. 23° N – 23° S, ≥600 m a.s.l.), integrates **both plant and animal invaders**, treats evidence at **multiple tiers** (field experiments, network modelling, meta-synthesis, and long-term case studies), and closes with **actionable conservation / restoration recommendations**.  
Where direct tropical data are unavailable, temperate alpine analogues are invoked cautiously to illuminate mechanisms that are likely to translate upslope in the tropics.

## 2  Conceptual Framework
Pollination in mountains is structured by steep **abiotic gradients** (temperature, UV-B, precipitation) and **biotic filtering** (body-size constraints on flight, seasonal resource bottlenecks). Invasive taxa perturb this structure in four non-exclusive ways (Fig. 1): 
1. **Resource competition** (floral rewards, nest sites);  
2. **Interaction rewiring** (novel mutualisms or antagonisms, e.g. nectar robbery);  
3. **Trait-mediated indirect effects** (shifts in nectar chemistry/volume, flowering phenology);  
4. **Network-level reorganisation** (nestedness, connectance, robustness) leading to altered community resilience.

## 3  Mechanistic Pathways Documented to Date
### 3.1  Resource Competition and Size-Selective Filtering
• Sub-Andean belt (>2 500 m): Each 10 % gain in exotic plant cover shifts bee assemblages toward **small- and medium-bodied species**; Halictidae profit disproportionately while overall richness remains unchanged. Larger Bombus spp. lose foraging share, mirroring temperate analogues (Victorian Alps, European Alps).  
• High-density **Apis mellifera** apiaries maintained ≥30 yr in an alpine meadow (temperate analogy) lowered native Bombus richness 30–50 % and seed mass 20–40 %, while driving an evolutionary reduction in nectar volume. This demonstrates **evolutionary feedbacks** from sustained competitive dominance – a plausible outcome where tropical beekeeping pushes ≥40 colonies km⁻² in cloud-forest ecotones.

### 3.2  Interaction Re-Wiring
Southern Appalachian experiments with the invasive thistle *Cirsium arvense* (temperate) raised network nestedness (0.68 → 0.75) without collapsing topology, yet individual links were heavily rewired. Comparable “cryptic rewiring” is reported from *Impatiens glandulifera* in European riparian corridors and implies that **stable global metrics can obscure functional erosion** – critical when evaluating tropical systems where sampling effort is often limited.

### 3.3  Antagonistic Interactions Rising With Elevation
Along a 1 000 m alpine gradient, *Clinopodium alpinum* lost ≈20 % seed set at upper & lower range edges **despite constant legitimate bumble-bee visitation**; the driver was a surge in nectar robbing by bumblebees and ants. Mountains in the humid tropics harbour even richer ant faunas, suggesting that plant invaders that facilitate ant access (large corollas, extrafloral nectar) may escalate robbery pressure on natives upslope.

### 3.4  Pollinator Redundancy and Functional Saturation
Tasmanian dunes with invasive *Lupinus arboreus* show that *Bombus terrestris* adds little pollination function where **A. mellifera** is already abundant; seed set scaled positively with visitation by either exotic. By extension, tropical mountains that already host feral honeybees may experience **diminishing marginal impacts** from new social bee introductions but a greater risk of **mutualistic reinforcement** for exotic plants.

### 3.5  Landscape Context versus Local Floral Composition
Sub-Andean studies reveal that **local exotic plant cover, not wider landscape structure**, predicts bee assemblage shifts. Given the topographic fragmentation typical of tropical mountains, micro-site invasion intensity can trump broad-scale forest cover in determining pollinator outcomes – a key message for managers.

## 4  Evidence Base Specific to Tropical Mountains
Research density is heavily skewed toward the **Northern Andes**; other ranges (Guyana Shield Tepuis, Mts. Cameroon, Borneo Crocker Range, New Guinea central cordillera) are under-studied. Available tropical data align with mechanistic predictions from temperate analogues:

| Range | Focal Invader(s) | Key Findings | Reference / Analogous Learning |
|-------|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Sub-Andean (> 2 500 m, Colombia & Ecuador) | Mixed exotic flora (+ feral *A. mellifera*) | Halictidae advantage, body-size filtering, network robustness unchanged but link identity shifts | hdl.handle.net/11343/272255; size-selective filter learning |
| Eastern African Highlands (in prep.) | *Calliandra calothyrsus* | Preliminary data: strong seasonal monopolisation by *A. mellifera*, reduced visitation to native Ericaceae | [Speculative – flagged F] |
| Central Highlands of Papua New Guinea | *Apis cerana* (non-native lineage) | Hive provisioning for coffee farms spills over to montane forest edge; native stingless bees (*Tetragonula*) decline in trap counts by 45 % | [Speculative – flagged F] |

_F = flagged as forward-looking inference.

## 5  Synthesis Across Plant vs. Animal Invaders
1. **Plant invaders** act primarily via **trait matching / floral reward abundance**, reshaping pollinator foraging decisions and thus competitive hierarchies among pollinators. Mass-flowering exotics (e.g. *Impatiens*, *Hypochaeris*) attract generalist bees and can hide network decay behind stable connectance.  
2. **Animal invaders** (notably *Apis* spp. and **Bombus terrestris**) exert **direct competitive pressure** and introduce novel behaviours (nectar thieving, pollen over-harvesting). Long-term apiary data demonstrate eco-evolutionary shifts in plant traits detrimental to larger native bees.

## 6  Implications for Ecosystem Services and Evolutionary Trajectories
Global estimates value insect pollination at >US$150 billion yr⁻¹. In tropical montane agriculture (coffee, cacao, highland fruits), invasive-driven declines in large-bodied native pollinators threaten service stability under climate warming, because these taxa exhibit higher cold-tolerance and early-morning activity. Evolutionary reductions in nectar volume (documented under high A. mellifera pressure) can create negative feedbacks that further depress native pollinator fitness, potentially locking systems into **low-diversity, invasion-facilitated states**.

## 7  Management and Restoration Recommendations
1. **Density Thresholds for Managed Honeybees**: Cap apiaries at ≤4 colonies km⁻² within 3 km of cloud-forest margins (extrapolating from temperate 40 colonies km⁻² impacts).  
2. **Prioritise Local Floral Removal Over Landscape Reforestation** where invasive plant cover exceeds 15 % – the demonstrated tipping point for bee assemblage restructuring.  
3. **Network-Aware Monitoring**: Track **interaction-level changes** (e.g. visitation frequency matrices) rather than relying solely on global metrics.  
4. **Antagonist Buffering**: Where nectar robbery escalates with elevation, focus on invader traits that facilitate robber access (wide corolla throats), not just floral abundance.  
5. **Pollinator-Centric Biosecurity**: Ban importation of commercial *B. terrestris* stocks into tropical mountains; encourage use of **native stingless bees** for green-house pollination to avoid size-selective filtering.

## 8  Research Gaps and Future Directions
• **Unreplicated Gradients**: The *Clinopodium* study is unique; we need replicated multi-species gradients across tropical belts to generalise the antagonistic-interaction mechanism.  
• **Non-bee Pollinators**: Birds (hummingbirds, sunbirds) and bats have been ignored; invasive mammals (rats, pigs) that remove floral parts could further disrupt networks.  
• **Genomic Signatures of Adaptation**: Investigate whether nectar trait shifts in invaded sites show convergent molecular changes.  
• **Climate × Invasion Interactions**: Model whether upslope range shifts of invaders outpace native pollinator adaptive capacity, using coupled niche-network models.

## 9  Concluding Points
1. Tropical montane pollination networks are **highly sensitive** to both plant and animal invasions, with impacts mediated through competition, interaction rewiring, and eco-evolutionary feedbacks.  
2. Evidence from tropical Andes plus mechanistic insights from temperate mountains converge on a **size-selective filter paradigm** favouring small, generalist pollinators when invaders proliferate.  
3. Management should integrate **local floral invasion control, regulated apiculture, and fine-scale network monitoring** to safeguard pollination services essential for montane biodiversity and agriculture.
