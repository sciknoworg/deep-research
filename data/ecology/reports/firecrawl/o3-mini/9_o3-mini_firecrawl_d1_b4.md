# Comprehensive Restoration Strategies for Degraded Peatlands

This report synthesizes current research and field-scale learnings on restoring degraded peatlands. It explores both passive and active intervention methods by integrating hydrological, ecological, and landscape-level approaches. Drawing on multi-regional studies—from boreal Canada to Indonesian peat swamps, and from temperate blanket bogs in Scotland to tropical systems—the report outlines detailed measures and their associated benefits, challenges, and trade-offs. The objective is to guide decision-making processes that aim to maximize carbon sequestration, biodiversity recovery, and water quality improvements while managing socio-economic factors.

## 1. Introduction

Peatlands, although occupying a small fraction of terrestrial area, provide disproportionate ecological benefits, including carbon storage, biodiversity support, and regulation of hydrological processes. The extensive drainage of peatlands has transformed these systems into significant sources of greenhouse gases, with contributions amounting to nearly 4% of anthropogenic emissions globally. As restoration efforts gain importance under international climate accords like the Paris Agreement, choosing optimized restoration strategies is critical.

The core challenges encompass:

- **Hydrological Degradation:** Lowering of water tables and altered soil moisture regimes that affect peat-forming species.
- **Carbon Dynamics:** Shift from carbon sink to source due to drainage and climatic factors.
- **Biodiversity Loss:** Impaired ecosystem services and species composition changes.

This report integrates learnings focused on both passive (e.g., rewetting and natural regeneration) and active (e.g., engineered infrastructure and vegetation replanting) restoration methods. It also pays attention to regional variability in peatland types, climate effects, and land-use legacies.

## 2. Hydrological Management and Rewetting Techniques

### 2.1. Field-Scale Interventions

Empirical evidence from numerous field-scale studies has underscored the role of rewetting measures such as ditch blocking and peat dam construction in restoring peatland hydrology. Key findings include:

- **Water Table Recovery:** Innovative measures successfully reduce groundwater response rates by over 60% (for instance, decreasing from ~17.4 mm/h in drained areas to roughly ~6.2 mm/h in rewetted sites). Accompanying this are raised groundwater levels (increases between 6–64 mm) and extended periods where water levels remain at or near the surface.

- **Spatial Extent of Impact:** However, the hydrological effect is spatially restricted. Research indicates that the effective impact radius for rewetting interventions, such as blocked ditches, averages between 17–24 meters. This suggests that while rewetting is highly effective locally, a larger-scale integration of similar interventions is necessary to restore the wider landscape effectively.

### 2.2. Timing and Seasonal Considerations

- **Seasonal Variations:** The timing of restoration interventions can profoundly influence outcomes. For instance, early spring interventions may offer heightened resilience as the system moves into the growing season, whereas interventions during hotter, drier periods might require adaptations to counteract rapid moisture loss.

- **Species Establishment:** Maintaining high water tables (ideally within 20–40 cm below the surface, depending on the regional context) is critical for the establishment and proliferation of peat-forming species like Sphagnum. These species are the cornerstone of peatland recovery, facilitating the re-establishment of a carbon-sequestering canopy.

## 3. Active vs. Passive Restoration Approaches

### 3.1. Passive Restoration

Passive restoration predominantly involves rewetting and natural regeneration. Its advantages include lower immediate cost and minimal intervention, making it suitable in regions where the peatland retains some functional integrity despite degradation. However, passive restoration may not suffice in more severely altered systems where active intervention is required to overcome legacy drainage effects and entrenched degradation.

### 3.2. Active Restoration Methods

Active restoration leverages engineering solutions and targeted biological interventions. Recent research highlights include:

- **Engineered Rewetting:** Combining techniques such as ditch blocking, peat reprofiling, and the moss layer transfer technique has proven highly effective. Models show these measures can reduce net greenhouse gas radiative forcing (CO₂ + CH₄) by up to 89% within 20 years. This is a stark improvement over passive measures, potentially accelerating the transition toward net climate neutrality by over a century.

- **Integration into a Wetscape:** A holistic approach that integrates near‐natural core reserves, productive paludiculture zones, and hydrological buffer zones. This layout not only addresses hydrological improvements but also creates economic opportunities through sustainable wet agriculture and forestry, ensuring a multi-functional landscape that supports both biodiversity and livelihoods.

- **Regional Case Studies:** In Minnesota, for example, detailed mapping combined with restoration easements has helped target approximately 1.44 million acres of peatland (both partially and fully drained areas). Funding under programs like the EPA’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grant and initiatives such as RIM Wetlands and CREP exemplifies how policy and science can align to tackle widespread degradation.

## 4. Regional and Climatic Contexts

### 4.1. Climatic Influence on Restoration

Climate significantly modulates restoration efficacy. For instance, in boreal systems, even modest warming (e.g., increases of around 4°F) can tip a peatland from being a net carbon sink to a net carbon source. This underscores the need for dynamically adaptive management practices that consider both current and future climatic projections.

### 4.2. Geographical Specificity in Restoration Planning

Peatland restoration must be tailored to the specifics of local hydrology, species composition, and historical land use:

- **Extraterrestrial Peatlands:** For temperate regions such as Scotland, achieving an optimum water table (often around 20 cm below the surface) is paramount for re-establishing native peat-forming species.

- **Tropical and Subtropical Systems:** In regions like Southeast Asia and the Congo Basin, interventions may require adaptations to deal with different hydrological regimes and vegetation communities. Here, spatial optimization models at high-resolution (e.g., 1 km² units) can help target both restoration and fire risk reduction strategies effectively.

- **Implications for Carbon Management:** Optimization studies, such as those from Indonesia, indicate that targeted restoration can potentially mitigate between 0.002–0.36 Pg CO2e per year at costs as low as US$2–19 per Mg CO2e. Nevertheless, trade-offs exist when balancing multiple co-benefits such as climate mitigation, biodiversity recovery, and fire risk reduction.

## 5. Integrative and Landscape-Level Approaches

### 5.1. The Wetscape Concept

A transformative strategy emerging from recent studies is the integration of rewetting within a broader ‘wetscape’ framework. Key elements include:

- **Protected Core Zones:** Areas preserved in near‐natural states to serve as reservoirs for biodiversity and peat accumulation.

- **Buffer Zones:** Hydrological buffers that mitigate edge effects and facilitate connectivity between degraded patches and core reserves.

- **Paludiculture:** The adoption of sustainable, water-tolerant agricultural and forestry practices that reconcile economic activities with ecological functions. This integrated model fosters socio-economic viability alongside environmental restoration, ensuring long-term resilience against both legacy drainage and ongoing climate change impacts.

### 5.2. Trade-Offs and Multi-objective Optimization

Bringing multiple objectives to bear in restoration projects introduces inherent trade-offs:

- **Water Quality vs. Carbon Sequestration:** While deep rewetting helps in carbon sequestration, it may sometimes delay the recovery of aquatic species or affect water quality differently.
- **Biodiversity Recovery vs. Fire Risk Reduction:** Higher resolution planning (e.g., at 1 km² units) may reveal spatial heterogeneities where addressing one goal might compromise another. Effective restoration planning thus requires embracing multi-objective optimization techniques that quantify and balance these outcomes.

## 6. Recommendations and Future Directions

### 6.1. Adaptive Management and Tailored Solutions

Given the complexity of peatland systems, effective restoration should be adaptive:

- Conduct **site-specific assessments** that consider local hydrological conditions, climatic projections, and historical land use.
- Apply a **combination of passive and active restoration techniques**, aligning the degree of intervention with the level of degradation.
- Monitor emergent hydrological and ecological responses through long-term, ecosystem-scale studies, akin to the research conducted across 53 sites in eastern Canada.

### 6.2. Embracing Technological and Modelling Advances

- Integration of **high-resolution spatial models** to inform multi-objective planning and cost–benefit analyses.
- Adoption of **remote sensing and field-based sensors (e.g., piezometer networks)** to monitor effective radii of hydrological impacts and to guide the timing and placement of interventions.
- Investment in research exploring **novel restoration techniques**—such as controlled peat reprofiling and the transplanting of peat moss layers—to expedite the return to ecological function.

### 6.3. Policy and Socio-economic Integration

- Align restoration initiatives with policy supports such as those seen in Minnesota and other regions. Secure multi-level funding that promotes long-term easements and management programs.
- Develop stakeholder partnerships that include local communities, conservation organizations, and landowners. This will facilitate knowledge exchange and ensure that restoration projects achieve socio-economic, alongside ecological, objectives.

### 6.4. Anticipating Climate Change

Future strategies must embed resilience against climatic variations:

- Model climate–vegetation interactions in experimental setups to better predict threshold shifts (e.g., from carbon sink to source) under warming scenarios.
- Consider the cumulative impacts of rapid climatic shifts and plan restoration actions in a phased, iterative manner to allow for recalibration of water table targets and species re-establishment efforts.

## 7. Conclusion

Restoring degraded peatlands presents a multifaceted challenge. The synthesis of field-scale studies, experimental analyses, and modeling efforts provides a robust framework for both active and passive restoration strategies. A careful balance of hydrological management, active interventions, and landscape-level integration underpins the path toward long-term ecosystem recovery. With tailored, adaptive management practices that acknowledge regional specificity and climatic pressures, peatland restoration can significantly contribute to carbon sequestration, biodiversity recovery, and enhanced water quality. Future research should emphasize innovative rewetting techniques, multi-objective spatial planning, and the integration of socio-economic strategies—ensuring that restoration efforts are resilient in the face of a rapidly changing climate.

This comprehensive strategy demands continued collaboration among scientists, policymakers, and communities, fostering the development of peatland landscapes that are both ecologically robust and socio-economically viable. The challenge, while significant, presents an opportunity to substantially mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and restore a vital component of the Earth’s natural heritage.
