# Enemy Release Hypothesis and Invasion Success: An Integrated Review

This report collates and synthesizes current understandings and research findings on the enemy release hypothesis (ERH) as an explanation for invasion success. The report draws on meta‐analyses, experimental designs, and mechanistic frameworks to explore the role of enemy reduction in facilitating invasive species establishment, while concurrently considering additional drivers such as disturbance, propagule pressure, and biotic resistance. In doing so, the report offers a comprehensive analysis that spans multiple ecosystems and taxonomic groups, and outlines key factors modulating the effects observed in alien species introductions.

## 1. Introduction

The enemy release hypothesis posits that invasive species experience reduced pressure from natural enemies—encompassing predators, pathogens, parasites, and herbivores—after introduction into a novel ecosystem. This loss of specialized enemy interactions relative to the native range is often considered a crucial factor for the observed demographic and competitive release in invaders. However, the complexity and variability across different environments and taxa suggest that enemy release, while significant, is intertwined with several other ecological processes. In this report, we review evidence from meta-analyses, experimental tests, and theoretical frameworks to critically assess whether enemy release adequately explains invasion success.

## 2. Empirical Evidence from Meta-Analyses

### 2.1 Differential Enemy Pressure Across Ecosystems

Meta-analytical studies provide broad support for ERH by showing that, on average, invasive species experience **reduced enemy pressure** compared to their native congeners. Notable points include:

- **Reduced Diversity and Impact:** The overall reduction in enemy diversity (with fewer specialist herbivores, pathogens, and parasites) in invasive ranges is well documented. In many cases, the quantitative loss is associated with diminished population regulation.
- **Ecosystem-Specific Variability:** Aquatic and marine systems tend to exhibit stronger enemy impacts overall compared to terrestrial systems. This indicates that species coming from environments with intense enemy pressure might be poised for substantial demographic benefits when introduced into ecosystems where enemy impacts are diminished.
- **Taxonomic Variation:** Variation in enemy losses is observed among taxa, with some families or life forms (e.g., plants vs. invertebrates) experiencing different levels of release. The interplay between physiological traits and the enemy spectrum further modulates invasion dynamics.

### 2.2 Methodological Considerations

An identified systematic variation in native enemy effects (Eₙ) across ecosystems and taxonomic groups emphasizes the importance of contextual variables. Discrepancies between observational studies and manipulative experimental designs underscore a key methodological issue: direct links between enemy loss and population performance measures are not always straightforward to establish. While observational studies consistently report enemy loss, experimental biogeographical studies sometimes yield conflicting results due to the complexity of interactions involved.

## 3. Disturbance and Its Role in Invasion Dynamics

### 3.1 The Role of Anthropogenic Disturbance

Disturbance—especially those stemming from anthropogenic activities—plays a critical and multifaceted role in facilitating invasion success. Key insights include:

- **Alteration of Resource Availability:** Disturbances can alter light regimes, nutrient availability, and habitat structure. Enhanced resource availability often propels rapid colonization by invasive species, particularly in ecosystems where the native propagule bank is diminished or slow to recover.
- **Interaction with Enemy Release:** By mediating competitive interactions and priority effects, disturbance can amplify the benefits provided by enemy release. For instance, in environments where native competitors are already stressed by altered resource dynamics, even a modest reduction in enemy pressure can have disproportionately high impacts on invader performance.

### 3.2 Prioritizing Contexts for Future Research

Incorporating disturbance into the enemy release framework may be critical for improved predictive models of invasion dynamics. Future research should focus on integrated field experiments that manipulate both enemy presence and disturbance factors to quantitatively assess their synergistic effects on invasion outcomes.

## 4. Integrative Mechanistic Frameworks

### 4.1 Decomposing Exotic Performance

A mechanistic framework has been proposed to better understand the nuances of ERH, decomposing invasive performance into three principal factors:

1. **Enemy Impact:** Direct amplitude by which natural enemies reduce invader performance.
2. **Enemy Diversity:** The breadth and range of natural enemy species absent from the introduced range.
3. **Host Adaptation:** The intrinsic adaptations of the invader, which may further minimize enemy interactions.

This framework is modulated by seven contexts which include:

- Time since introduction
- Resource availability
- Phylogenetic relatedness between invader and native species
- Host–enemy asynchronicity
- Number of introduction events
- Enemy type
- Growth–defence trade-offs

The decomposed approach clarifies why some invasive species may benefit more profoundly from enemy release than others. It also facilitates nuanced comparisons between ERH and other invasion hypotheses, such as those focusing on propagule pressure and biotic resistance.

### 4.2 Context Dependency and Multi-Factor Interactions

Experimental tests, particularly those employing biogeographical comparisons and manipulative designs, highlight that the benefits of enemy release are highly context-dependent. For example, studies on invasive woody plants (e.g., Callery pear) have illustrated that while reduced specialist herbivory offers a significant advantage, the inherent life-history traits of the species (fast growth and high fecundity) are equally influential. Such cases affirm that enemy release rarely operates as a solitary mechanism but rather as one component within a matrix of interacting forces.

## 5. Beyond Enemy Release: Complementary Drivers of Invasion Success

### 5.1 Propagule Pressure and Biotic Resistance

While enemy release is a strong hypothesis, empirical evidence suggests that invasion success is best understood through a lens that considers multiple reinforcing factors:

- **Propagule Pressure:** The abundance and frequency of introduction events have a decisive effect on establishment probability. High propagule pressure can overwhelm even well-defended ecosystems, limiting the scope of biotic resistance.
- **Biotic Resistance:** Native community resilience—measured in terms of species richness, abundance, and competitive dynamics—is often overlooked. A comprehensive assessment that includes both invasive species performance and native community responses can reveal the conditions under which enemy release and propagule pressure synergistically drive invader success.

### 5.2 Implications for Management

Strategies focused solely on the enemy release angle may miss opportunities for integrated management. For instance, enhancing native community resistance through restoration of functional guilds (e.g., bolstering native predator populations) may help mitigate the benefits conferred by enemy release. Additionally, management can benefit from understanding the context-specific thresholds where propagule pressure tips the balance in favor of invasion.

## 6. Methodological Discrepancies and Future Directions

### 6.1 Bridging Observational and Experimental Approaches

A notable challenge in the literature is the methodological discrepancy between studies:

- **Observational Studies:** Tend to report enemy loss and correlate it with invasion success. However, they often fail to directly link enemy absence to increased demographic parameters in the invading populations.
- **Experimental Designs:** Manipulative studies sometimes yield ambiguous outcomes because they cannot fully capture the complex interplay of multiple biotic and abiotic factors in situ.

Establishing integrated experimental protocols that combine long-term field observations with controlled manipulations will be key to resolving these discrepancies and directly testing the causal mechanisms underlying enemy release.

### 6.2 Expanding Taxonomic and Ecosystem Scope

Future research should strive to expand beyond the traditional focal groups (e.g., terrestrial plants) to include a wider range of taxa and aquatic ecosystems. This broader approach will allow for a more definitive testing of ERH and its interactions with additional drivers of invasion success. The integration of genomic and transcriptomic data may also elucidate host–pathogen and host–herbivore coevolutionary dynamics in notoriously invasive species.

### 6.3 Incorporating Theoretical and Predictive Modelling

Apart from empirical work, the development of advanced mechanistic models that incorporate multiple layers of biotic interactions (enemy effects, propagule pressure, mutualisms) is essential. Such models can capture non-linear dynamics and emergent properties that simpler conceptual models might overlook. Agent-based models, for example, could simulate invasion scenarios under varying degrees of enemy pressure and disturbance, providing new insights into threshold effects and critical transitions.

## 7. Conclusion

The enemy release hypothesis provides a valuable, albeit partial, explanation for invasion success. While meta-analyses consistently show reduced enemy pressure in the introduced range, the degree to which this reduction translates into invasion success is context dependent, influenced by disturbances, propagule pressure, biotic resistance, and intrinsic species traits. The integrative mechanistic frameworks discussed in this report highlight that ERH, although compelling, interacts with a suite of ecological processes that must be accounted for in both research and management.

For future progress, it is imperative to design integrated experiments that couple observational data with manipulative studies, thereby clarifying the direct causal links between enemy release and invader performance. Additionally, broadening the taxonomic and ecosystem scope and employing advanced modelling techniques promise to refine our understanding of invasion dynamics and enhance management strategies aimed at mitigating the impacts of invasive species.

This multi-layered, integrative approach allows us to view enemy release as one piece within a complex puzzle—a puzzle that requires a collaborative synthesis of meta-analysis, experimental manipulation, and theoretical innovation to fully comprehend the drivers of invasion success in our rapidly changing world.
