# Final Report: Comparative Efficiency of Mowing Versus Grazing in Restoring Plant Diversity

*Date: 2025-06-03*

This report synthesizes findings from a range of empirical studies and meta-analyses, drawing on long-term and multi-site experiments in temperate regions and beyond, to critically evaluate when mowing may be more efficient than grazing in restoring plant diversity. The report examines the roles of management interventions, contextual environmental factors, and methodological approaches used in previous research to provide an integrated overview of the mechanisms and outcomes associated with each method.

## 1. Introduction

The restoration of plant diversity in semi‐natural grasslands, scrublands, forest edges, and other ecosystems is an evolving challenge in conservation management. Two widespread management approaches—mowing and grazing—have been used both interchangeably and complementarily to control competitive species, modify vegetation structure, and reset successional trajectories. However, their efficiency varies considerably across landscapes and experimental contexts. This report delves into the context-dependent efficiency of mowing relative to grazing, with emphasis on plant species richness, functional diversity, and community composition. We compile insights from robust long-term experiments, indicator systems, and meta-analytical techniques, aiming to delineate conditions under which mowing may outperform grazing.

## 2. Mechanisms Underpinning Mowing and Grazing

### 2.1 Removal of Biomass and Litter

- **Mowing:** 
  - Uniform removal of biomass, which significantly reduces litter accumulation.
  - Enhanced light penetration is achieved due to the uniform thinning of vegetation. This, in turn, decreases competitive exclusion and allows for the establishment of subordinate and early-successional species.
  - Evidence from long-term field experiments indicates that mowing, particularly when applied post-reproductive phase, "resets" community composition in systems where succession has led to dominance by a few late-successional species (e.g., Elytrigia atherica in salt marshes).

- **Grazing:** 
  - Grazing by herbivores is inherently selective. At low intensities, grazing leads to moderate biomass removal, but also contributes to increased nutrient availability due to excreta deposition.
  - The uneven nature of grazing leads to heterogeneity in vegetation structure, including increased microrelief and variability in micro-climatic conditions.
  - Long-term experiments indicate that while grazing maintains heterogeneity and supports the establishment of nutrient-enriched and open-habitat specialist species, it often does so at the expense of more uniformly distributed subordinate species.

### 2.2 Nutrient Cycling

- **Mowing:** 
  - Eliminates above-ground biomass rapidly, thereby curbing the internal nutrient recycling that may lead to excess nutrient availability which in turn favors competitive species.
  - Indicator systems developed regionally (e.g., by Bertilsson & Paltto, and Ekstam & Forshed) have been used to classify species according to their responses to nutrient enrichment. Uniform mowing regimes can better support sensorily balanced communities by avoiding sharp nutrient peaks.

- **Grazing:** 
  - Even at low intensities, grazing triggers nutrient recycling through animal excreta, which may benefit ruderal species. Only at higher intensities does grazing tend to moderate these nutrient pulses sufficiently to sustain vegetation heterogeneity.

## 3. Contextual Considerations: Ecosystem Type and Environmental Variables

The efficiency of either intervention is strongly moderated by environmental context and management history. The following factors are critical in determining when mowing may be more efficient than grazing:

### 3.1 Ecosystem Type and Successional Stage

- In disturbed or abandoned systems, where unregulated succession reduces diversity, mowing has shown its strength by uniformly removing biomass and re-establishing a favorable light environment. By doing so, mowing can facilitate the resurgence of species with broad ecological amplitudes.
- Conversely, in more undisturbed and structurally complex systems, grazing’s selective pressure might promote distinct functional groups and maintain vegetation heterogeneity.

### 3.2 Soil Fertility, Slope, and Micro-Habitat Gradients

- **Soil Type and Fertility:** The response of plant communities to mowing versus grazing is often mediated by local soil conditions. Studies indicate that in nutrient-poor soils or those with high competition from dominant grasses, mowing can deliver more pronounced benefits by reducing litter and light limitations.
- **Slope and Connectivity:** Topographical variations and connectivity to species‐rich propagule sources are crucial. Connectivity facilitates dispersal and establishment; thus, even if mowing has a generally uniform effect, its efficiency in isolated patches might be reduced compared to areas with greater propagule input.

### 3.3 Timing, Frequency, and Intensity

- **Mowing Frequency:** Research, including long-term European studies and meta-analyses, shows that adjusting mowing frequency (e.g., one versus multiple times per year) can yield similar conservation outcomes under the right local conditions. Notably, once or twice-yearly mowing regimes have been effective in boosting species richness by approximately 32% in some studies.
- **Grazing Intensity:** Grazing outcomes are more variable and heavily tied to the intensity of animal presence. Low-intensity grazing may inadvertently promote nutrient enrichment, whereas normal to high grazing intensities tend to better maintain a heterogenous structure. This has been demonstrated using principal response curves and structural equation modeling which illustrate the direct and indirect (soil-mediated) effects on plant community composition.

## 4. Empirical Evidence and Meta-analytical Insights

### 4.1 Key Case Studies and Experiments

- **Northern Temperate Grasslands (e.g., Sweden, Hungary):** Long‐term experiments reveal that mowing effectively suppresses the dominance of competitive grasses such as Calamagrostis epigejos. This limitation of competitive exclusion leads to an increase in species richness and a shift towards grassland indicator species, which is especially beneficial in semi-natural grasslands.
- **Swiss Pre‐Alps Wet Grasslands:** Meta-analyses conducted by Tälle et al. (2016) and related studies have compared the outcomes of grazing and mowing, demonstrating that while both methods maintain species diversity, the mechanisms diverge. Grazing enhances microrelief and supports nutrient-rich specialists, while mowing creates a more consistent vegetative environment favoring species with broad ecological tolerances.

### 4.2 Integrated Indicator Systems

- Regional indicator systems that classify plant species into management response categories (e.g., good management vs. excess nitrogen indicators) have been critical in parsing the nuanced outcomes of both management regimes. While effect sizes associated with these classifications are moderate (log OR differences of approximately 0.21–0.4), the convergence of results over multiple sites and years provides robust evidence for adaptive management.
- Empirical analyses have shown that mowing's uniform removal of biomass, when applied systematically, leads to a stable and repeatable shift in plant community structures that might not be achievable through variable grazing pressures.

## 5. Synthesis: When is Mowing More Efficient?

### 5.1 General Conditions Favoring Mowing

1. **Disturbed or Abandoned Systems:** In ecosystems where succession has led to a dominance of late-successional or competitive species, mowing efficiently resets community composition and promotes early-successional species with broad ecological amplitudes.
2. **Uniform Vegetation Cover Desirable:** When the conservation goal is to lower biomass uniformly to reduce competitive exclusion, mowing provides a more controlled and predictable outcome than the often patchy effects of grazing.
3. **Post-Reproductive Phases:** Timing mowing operations post-reproductive phase ensures that seed banks are sufficiently reset, allowing for the establishment of desired indicator species.
4. **Sites with Limited Nutrient Accumulation:** In environments where nutrient recycling via grazing might lead to excess nitrogen, mowing circumvents this issue by removing biomass before significant nutrient resorption occurs.

### 5.2 Limitations and Considerations

- **Ecological Specificity:** The advantages of mowing are not universally applicable. In structurally complex or undisturbed ecosystems, the selective nature of grazing can promote desired heterogeneity and functional differentiation.
- **Local Environmental Modifiers:** Soil types, slope, and proximity to propagule sources must be considered in management planning. Even if mowing shows a theoretical advantage, its success is contingent upon favorable local conditions.
- **Management History and Long-Term Effects:** Long-term experiments indicate that both management regimes produce measurable shifts in soil chemistry and plant composition over time. Stakeholder expectations and policy decisions should be based on an adaptive management framework that utilizes iterative monitoring.

## 6. Implications for Conservation Management and Future Research

### 6.1 Adaptive and Evidence-Based Management

- **Integrating Indicator Systems:** Managers should incorporate regional indicator frameworks to tailor mowing or grazing interventions based on species-specific responses to management-induced changes in nutrient availability and vegetation structure.
- **Context-Specific Protocols:** Rather than a “one-size-fits-all” approach, the choice between mowing and grazing should be based on a holistic understanding of local environmental conditions, successional stages, and management histories. This includes scalable monitoring protocols that assess vegetation structure, species richness, and functional diversity over both alpha and beta scales.

### 6.2 Technological and Methodological Innovations

- **Remote Sensing and High-Resolution Mapping:** Recent advances in remote sensing offer the possibility of tracking real-time changes in vegetation structure and biomass variability. Coupling these techniques with in situ measurements will refine the ability to predict the outcomes of both mowing and grazing across heterogeneous landscapes.
- **Simulation Modeling:** State-of-the-art simulation models based on structural equation modeling, principal response curves, and even machine-learning algorithms should be integrated into decision-support systems. Such models can help predict how varying frequencies and intensities of mowing versus grazing will influence long-term community dynamics.
- **Integrated Experimental Frameworks:** Future research should strive for multi-site, multi-year experiments that not only compare mowing and grazing but also test hybrid approaches. These could include integrated systems where initial mowing is followed by controlled grazing to maintain heterogeneity while resetting community composition.

### 6.3 Emerging and Contrarian Perspectives

- **Hybrid Management Strategies:** An underexplored area is the potential benefit of combining mowing with selective, timed grazing. Preliminary findings suggest that such hybrid regimes may balance the benefits of uniform biomass removal with the long-term heterogeneity benefits of grazing.
- **Ecological Engineering and Resilience Theory:** Viewing mowing as a form of ecological engineering could prompt new research into resilience theory. Understanding how management interventions might buffer ecosystems against future disturbances (e.g., climate change, invasive species) is critical. Future studies should experimentally test these hypotheses across contrasting ecosystems.

## 7. Conclusions

The comparative efficiency of mowing versus grazing in restoring plant diversity is profoundly context-dependent. While mowing consistently provides a controlled and predictable method for reducing biomass and resetting competitive dynamics—thereby benefiting light-demanding, subordinate species—the effectiveness of grazing hinges on appropriate intensity and selective pressure that maintains vegetation heterogeneity. Mowing appears particularly advantageous in disturbed or abandoned systems, in environments prone to nutrient overload from grazing, and when uniform community restructuring is desired.

In summary, a nuanced and adaptive management approach that leverages technological advances, established indicator systems, and robust experimental data will be essential for tailoring interventions to local conditions. As demonstrated, the decision between mowing and grazing is not binary but rather a complex interplay between management objectives, environmental context, and the inherent dynamics of plant community succession.
