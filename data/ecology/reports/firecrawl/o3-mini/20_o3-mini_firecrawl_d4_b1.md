# Final Report on the Effects of Green Roofs on Urban Insect Biodiversity

This detailed report synthesizes a wide range of learnings from recent research on green roofs and their impacts on urban insect biodiversity. The findings span methodological advancements, urbanization metrics, functional trait analyses, and experimental challenges, with a special focus on multi‐trophic interactions and standardized evaluation frameworks. Below, we provide an in-depth discussion of these topics, structured into several sections that collectively capture the state-of-the-art in this rapidly evolving research area.

## 1. Introduction

Urban greenspaces have increasingly become an integral component of urban planning and sustainability initiatives, and green roofs are at the forefront of these interventions. Initially designed for stormwater management and thermal regulation, green roofs have come to be recognized for their potential to foster biodiversity in fragmented urban landscapes. Research has particularly focused on how green roofs contribute to urban insect biodiversity, a key indicator of ecological health, with many studies exploring both taxonomic and functional dimensions.

The literature reveals a complex interplay between green roof design elements (e.g., substrate depth, vegetation composition), urbanization metrics (e.g., impervious surface cover, local climate indices), and functional traits among insect communities. In the following sections, we delve into the primary learnings from the research and attempt to chart a course for future studies, while addressing the methodological inconsistencies that currently hinder cross-study synthesis.

## 2. Methodological Advances in Studying Green Roofs

### 2.1 Experimental Frameworks and Design Protocols

Current leading research has placed strong emphasis on the development of standardized experimental frameworks designed to capture both taxonomic and functional diversity. Several studies have integrated explicit design factors such as:

- **Substrate Depth and Composition:** Variations in substrate depth can influence moisture retention and microhabitat conditions, influencing community assembly among insect populations.

- **Vegetation Composition:** Key taxa such as Sedum have been used as indicator species in controlled design experiments. Diverse plant assemblages not only contribute to increased species richness but also support a wide array of functional traits critical for services such as pollination and microclimatic regulation.

- **Connectivity Metrics:** Factors like green roof connectivity with other urban greenspaces are assessed to evaluate habitat connectivity and its potential to serve as an ecological corridor. Statistical tools including generalized linear models, AICc model averaging, RLQ, and fourth‐corner analyses have been applied in these contexts to assess multi‐trophic interactions.

These elements underscore that replicability and control are vital. However, the scarcity of conventional controls and the lack of adequate replication in many studies (with only around 33 studies quantitatively appraising biodiversity) is a significant methodological roadblock.

### 2.2 Integrating Urban Metrics into Ecological Research

A shift towards integrating consistent, quantitative urbanization metrics in experimental designs has been notable. Researchers have begun to incorporate tangible urban parameters, including:

- **Impervious Surface Percentage:** This metric is crucial in correlating urban densification with changes in microclimatic conditions that affect insect communities.

- **Building Density and Local Climate Indices:** Studies have shown that these parameters, especially when combined with models like ENVI‐met and LCZ classifications, help elucidate the functional responses of green roofs to urban heat island effects and localized climate anomalies.

- **Remote Sensing Data:** Efforts to use Earth Observation datasets (e.g., Copernicus Land Cover and NASA soil hydrological data) have advanced the capability to standardize these measurements across different geographic contexts.

These urbanization metrics are essential not only in evaluating the performance of green roofs but also for creating unified global indices that can more reliably compare ecological responses across diverse urban settings.

## 3. Quantitative Biodiversity Metrics and Functional Trait Analysis

### 3.1 Taxonomic Versus Functional Diversity

Though many studies report lower species richness on green roofs compared to ground-level habitats, there is compelling evidence suggesting that when functional diversity indices (such as Rao’s quadratic entropy and functional dispersion) are deployed, green roofs can support a broad range of functional traits. This functional diversity highlights critical ecosystem functions, including:

- **Pollination Services:** A diversified insect community helps maintain pollinator networks even in urban centers.

- **Habitat Connectivity:** Functional traits represented by insects may facilitate movement and gene flow between isolated green spaces.

- **Microclimatic Regulation:** The abundance of specific functional traits linked to microhabitat cooling efficiencies has been observed in areas with optimally designed green roofs.

### 3.2 Multi‐Trophic Interactions

Recent standardized protocols have begun capturing multi‐trophic interactions, which include not only insects but extend to higher trophic levels. The insights gained from RLQ and fourth‐corner statistical analyses help clarify how green roof designs affect interactions among predators, prey, and competing species. Such analyses offer insights into ecosystem services that transcend conventional species richness measurements.

### 3.3 Meta-Analytical Evidence

Meta-analyses of green infrastructure (GI) reflect that specific constructed elements, including green roofs, yield significant biodiversity benefits compared to conventional grey infrastructure. Observed effect sizes (e.g., Hedge’s g around 1.0 ± 0.33 with p < 0.003) confirm the advantage, although the responses are taxa-specific. Vertebrate gains are generally consistent, whereas invertebrate (especially insect) responses require further detailed investigation using functional trait analyses.

## 4. Challenges and Limitations in Current Research

### 4.1 Variability in Experimental Protocols

The research landscape concerning green roofs is replete with methodological disparities. The variation in protocols—from the use of standardized controls to differences in sampling intervals and design replicability—creates challenges in cross-study comparisons. This variation is particularly evident in insect community studies, where differences in spatiotemporal sampling and urban quantification metrics hinder broader synthesis.

### 4.2 Data Bias and Standardization Issues

Methodological differences and inherent data biases, especially in how urbanization is quantified (e.g., residential land use, impervious surfaces, proximity to urban development), reduce the reliability of multi‐study comparisons. Researchers have called for theDevelopment of harmonized protocols that consistently capture both taxonomic diversity and functional traits within multi‐trophic frameworks. Leveraging robust experimental designs and unified urban indices via remote sensing further stands as a key recommendation.

### 4.3 Incorporating Risk-Based Metrics and Simulation Models

Recent studies employing risk-based and simulation methodologies, such as the curve number method for flood risk assessment in urban contexts (e.g., Milan), illustrate the potential of data-driven simulation techniques. These models integrate iterative and scenario-based analyses, balancing ecological responses with urban infrastructure metrics. While promising, these approaches require continued refinement to improve predictive reliability and cross-geographic applicability.

## 5. Future Directions and Recommendations

### 5.1 Developing Standardized Experimental Frameworks

Moving forward, future research should emphasize the development and adoption of standardized, trait-based experimental protocols. Such protocols should encompass:

- Detailed quantification of physical factors (substrate depth, plant species composition)
- Consistent measures of urbanization metrics (impervious surface percentage, local climatic conditions)
- Integration of multi‐trophic functional trait analyses that move beyond simple species richness measures

Establishing agreed-upon metrics and utilizing robust statistical analyses (e.g., RLQ, fourth‐corner methods) will enhance the comparability of studies and improve replicability across diverse urban contexts.

### 5.2 Leveraging Advanced Remote Sensing and Geospatial Technologies

Incorporating remote sensing coupled with Earth Observation datasets offers an advanced approach to standardizing urban metrics across scales. Future work should explore harmonized geospatial protocols, which, along with process-based models (e.g., InVEST, ENVI‐met) and empirical vulnerability functions, can support the construction of a globally applicable index for urban green infrastructure performance.

### 5.3 Emphasizing Multi‐Scenario and Risk-Based Analyses

Progress in risk-based methods and multi-scenario analyses provides a promising avenue for linking ecological outcomes with urban planning and infrastructure. Iterative simulation techniques that prioritize key variables (e.g., water depth in flood risk models) should be further extended to integrate biodiversity responses for complex urban systems.

### 5.4 Tailoring Green Roof Designs to Local Contexts

Given the context dependency of green roof performance highlighted by numerous studies, adopting a flexible, data-driven approach is crucial. Urban planners and ecologists should customize green roof designs based on local urbanization metrics, climatic conditions, and available species pools. This tailoring will ensure that green roofs do not solely become aesthetic or infrastructural elements but serve as robust hubs for urban biodiversity, especially for insect communities.

## 6. Conclusion

The body of research on green roofs and urban insect biodiversity has grown considerably, reflecting both technological advancements and a deepening understanding of urban ecosystems. Empirical evidence robustly supports that with appropriate design — integrating careful planning of physical, biological, and urban factors — green roofs can provide significant ecological benefits, even in high-density urban environments.

The synthesis provided in this report underscores several pivotal points:

- Standardized experimental design using consistent metrics is essential for reliable cross-study comparisons.
- Integrating urbanization metrics such as impervious surface cover and local climate indices is crucial to understand the context-dependent performance of green roofs.
- Despite lower species richness, green roofs may maintain comparable functional diversity, which is critical for ecosystem services including pollination, habitat connectivity, and microclimatic regulation.
- Future research must incorporate risk-based simulation analyses and robust remote sensing technologies to develop a globally applicable index for green roof performance.

These insights not only validate current green roof interventions but also offer comprehensive guidelines to bridge the methodological gaps. By addressing these challenges, future research can facilitate more accurate and holistic assessments of urban insect biodiversity, ultimately guiding better urban planning and sustainable design strategies.
