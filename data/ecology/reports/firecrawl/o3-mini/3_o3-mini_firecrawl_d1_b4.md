# Final Report: The Role of Mowing in Grassland Maintenance

## 1. Introduction

Grasslands represent some of the most dynamic ecosystems on the planet, serving as critical reservoirs of biodiversity, key regulators of nutrient cycles, and providers of ecosystem services ranging from forage production to cultural landscapes. Among the various management strategies employed to sustain these ecosystems, mowing has emerged as a particularly versatile tool. This report synthesizes the latest research, integrating findings from both conservation and agricultural contexts to elucidate how mowing maintains grassland ecosystems. The discussion synthesizes ecological impacts, temporal and spatial scales of intervention, interactions with other management practices such as grazing and prescribed burning, and the implications of historical and regional management legacies.

## 2. Ecological Impacts of Mowing

### 2.1 Plant Biodiversity and Community Structure

Mowing practices induce a series of ecological disturbances that can be either beneficial or detrimental, depending on the intensity, frequency, and timing of the intervention. Key research findings indicate that:

- **Species Richness Dynamics:** A reduction in mowing frequency from intensive regimes (6–12 times per year) to minimal regimes (once or twice per season) typically results in a notable increase in plant species richness (by approximately 30%). This occurs because less frequent mowing allows for colonization by typical meadow forbs, thus enhancing spatial heterogeneity. The intermediate disturbance resulting from moderate mowing aligns with the humped‐back model of biodiversity, where a balance is struck between competitive exclusion and succession.

- **Community Composition and Functional Traits:** Detailed analyses in urban grasslands in western France have demonstrated that while specific mowing regimes (e.g., early versus late mowing) may not significantly alter overall measures of diversity (e.g., Shannon diversity or species richness), they do substantially alter plant community composition. Shifts in functional traits, such as variations in competitive versus stress‐tolerant strategies (CSR scores), can be attributed to mowing. Such changes are especially pronounced when vegetation patches are considered in the context of surrounding landscape matrices, where factors like proportions of impervious surfaces and crop areas contribute as much as twice the influence of mowing settings.

- **Scale‐Dependent Effects:** Mowing frequency and timing have scale‐dependent consequences. Studies in sandplain and agricultural grasslands have shown that late-season mowing reduces woody regrowth and promotes the cover of forbs and graminoids. Conversely, frequent or intensive mowing tends toward homogenization, often leading to the predominance of lawn‐type species. This dual outcome underscores the importance of managing mowing practices at both the patch and landscape levels to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functionality.

### 2.2 Nutrient Cycling and Ecosystem Multifunctionality

The interaction between mowing and nutrient cycles is another pivotal aspect of grassland management:

- **Reduction in Litter and Nutrient Redistribution:** Moderate mowing serves as a disturbance mechanism that removes excessive litter and dominant graminoids, thereby reducing soil nitrogen levels and alleviating light competition. This can potentially foster an environment where other species establish more effectively, enhancing both above‐ and below‐ground interactions.

- **Coupling of Above‐ and Below‐Ground Processes:** Research from Eurasian steppe grasslands highlights that even when grazing has been widely applied, mowing alone supports higher multifunctionality by maintaining stronger coupling between above‐ and below‐ground processes. This coupling is critical for nutrient cycling, influencing the distribution and availability of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus within the ecosystem.

- **Non‐Additive Effects in Combined Management:** The more intense scenarios where mowing is combined with grazing disrupt positive correlations between plant richness and soil function. This suggests that the simultaneous application of multiple land‐use drivers can lead to non‐additive effects, potentially compromising ecosystem resilience and multifunctionality.

## 3. Temporal and Spatial Dimensions of Mowing

### 3.1 Mowing Frequency and Timing

The effects of mowing on grassland ecosystems are profoundly influenced by the timing and frequency of mowing events:

- **Seasonal Timing:** Comparative studies indicate that summer or late-season mowing is effective in reducing woody vegetation and favoring the proliferation of forbs and graminoids. Such temporal specificity allows for a strategic manipulation of plant community dynamics to favor desirable species over invasive or overly competitive species.

- **Intensity and Frequency:** While intensive mowing (repeated multiple times per season) can lead to degraded species diversity and homogenized plant communities, irregular or less frequent mowing creates spatial mosaics that facilitate a broader range of species with varied functional strategies. These findings underscore the delicate balance needed between disturbance and stability in grassland ecosystems.

### 3.2 Landscape and Regional Variations

Regional studies provide context-specific insights into how mowing practices should be tailored:

- **Urban vs. Rural Contexts:** In urban grasslands, where the surrounding landscape matrix (including impervious surfaces and cultivated lands) plays a significant role, mowing practices must be viewed within the broader context of landscape composition. For example, analyses in western France revealed that landscape composition explains approximately 13.2% of the variance in plant community structure—significantly more than the variance attributed solely to mowing.

- **Historical Land-Use Legacies:** In regions such as the alpine grasslands of Lautaret and Stubai, historical transitions from traditional, heterogeneous mowing to more intensive grazing or even abandonment have resulted in shifts from fine‐grained multifunctional landscapes to more homogeneous settings. These historical changes underscore the need for management strategies that consider both legacy effects and current ecological dynamics.

## 4. Mowing in the Broader Grassland Management Framework

### 4.1 Integration with Prescribed Burning and Grazing

Grassland management is not reliant on mowing alone. Instead, it functions as an integral component of a broader ecosystem management strategy that may include grazing and prescribed burning:

- **Prescribed Burning:** Fire regimes play a crucial role in maintaining grassland openness and resilience. Prescribed burning, like mowing, assists in litter removal and nutrient cycling. However, prescribed burning typically achieves these outcomes in a manner that can buffer against the eventual build-up of nutrients; yet, short-term studies (<15 years) might inadvertently underrepresent or misrepresent the long-term impacts on community composition. The synergistic effects between burning and mowing can provide complementary benefits to grassland management.

- **Grazing Impacts:** While grazing has been shown to reduce above‐ and below‐ground productivity and nutrient concentrations, its interactions with mowing are complex. Grazing tends to affect surface soil layers more than belowground root nutrients (C, N, and P), and studies suggest that selective grazing combined with mowing might optimize plant–soil linkages. Grazing, when applied less intensively or when combined with mowing, can sometimes enhance species richness and functional diversity compared to either practice alone.

### 4.2 Multi-Scale and Context-Specific Management

The inherent complexity of grassland ecosystems demands a flexible, multi-scale approach that accounts for abiotic conditions (e.g., soil type, moisture, climate) and site‐specific dynamics. The cumulative research suggests that:

- **Long-Term Considerations:** Management interventions must be assessed over longer time scales to capture the full spectrum of ecological responses. Non‐additive interactions between mowing, grazing, and other disturbances may only become apparent in long-term, multi-scale studies.

- **Tailored Interventions:** Given regional differences and historical land-use legacies, one-size-fits-all management strategies are insufficient. Customizing mowing regimes (in terms of frequency, timing, and intensity) according to the specific ecological context (urban, alpine, agricultural) is essential for sustaining both productivity and biodiversity.

## 5. Mowing and Invertebrate Dynamics

Beyond its impact on plant communities and nutrient cycles, mowing also plays a significant role in shaping the dynamics of grassland invertebrates. Research has found the following:

- **Arthropod Abundance:** There is often a 3-7 fold increase in arthropod abundance approximately 100 days after mowing compared to immediately post-mowing. This temporal rebound suggests that while mowing initially disturbs invertebrate communities, it eventually creates conditions favorable to arthropod recovery and population growth.

- **Equipment Sensitivity:** The type of machinery used for mowing (e.g., mulchers versus bar mowers) and the selected cutting height significantly influence invertebrate responses. Mulchers, which tend to shred plant material more finely, may inflict greater harm to sensitive arthropod orders relative to bar mowers that leave larger plant clippings intact. Such findings highlight the importance of integrating equipment choice into management plans.

## 6. Synthesizing Contrasting Impacts and Management Trade-offs

The research indicates that mowing interacts with other forms of grassland management in nuanced ways. Key considerations include:

- **Trade-Offs Between Productivity and Biodiversity:** Mowing can lead to trade-offs where enhancing one ecosystem function (e.g., biomass production) might compromise another (e.g., species diversity). The intermediate disturbance characterized by moderate mowing regimes is often optimal under the humped-back model of biodiversity, wherein species richness peaks at moderate levels of disturbance.

- **The Impact of Combined Management Regimes:** Studies that have examined scenarios involving both mowing and grazing reveal that the most intensive management practices can decouple the positive correlations typically observed between plant richness and soil functions. These non‐additive, synergistic or antagonistic interactions emphasize the need for a balanced, integrated approach rather than relying exclusively on a single regime.

- **Invasive Species and Dominant Grasses:** Through recurrent mowing, managers can inhibit the competitive dominance of certain aggressive graminoids and invasive species. However, care must be taken to ensure that mowing is not so intensive as to inadvertently select for species that are resilient to disturbance but may not contribute to ecosystem multifunctionality.

## 7. Future Directions and Proposed Solutions

### 7.1 Innovative Mowing Regimes

Given the depth of current research, there remain several promising avenues for future exploration:

- **Adaptive Mowing Frequency:** Incorporating real-time remote sensing data to dynamically adjust mowing schedules could optimize the balance between biomass removal and biodiversity conservation. Such adaptive management systems could help avoid over-mowing while ensuring that litter and invasive species are kept in check.

- **Equipment Innovation:** Exploration into less invasive mowing technologies could reduce immediate impacts on sensitive invertebrate populations. For instance, developing mower systems that can modulate cutting height or deploy precision sensing to protect arthropod hotspots would be advantageous.

- **Mosaic Mowing Techniques:** Implementing mosaic or patch-level mowing—where different areas are mowed at differing frequencies and times—could further enhance spatial heterogeneity. This fine-grained approach may support a broader spectrum of ecological functions across a single landscape.

### 7.2 Multi-Dimensional Monitoring and Research

To maximize the benefits of mowing and other management practices, ongoing long-term monitoring is essential:

- **Integrating Ecosystem Functions:** Future studies should aim to simultaneously monitor plant biodiversity, nutrient cycling, invertebrate dynamics, and soil properties to fully capture the cascade of ecological impacts.

- **Context-Specific Frameworks:** Building on the multifaceted data from regions ranging from Eurasian steppes to alpine and urban grasslands, it is critical to develop context-specific decision-support systems. These frameworks would assist land managers in tailoring interventions based on both historical trajectories and current ecological conditions.

- **Potential for Experimental Approaches:** There is scope to design experimental protocols that couple mowing with complementary management strategies (e.g., rotational grazing, intermittent prescribed burns) to map out non-additive ecosystem responses over time. Given the dynamic and multi-scale nature of grasslands, integrating experimental and observational data will be critical in refining current models.

## 8. Conclusion

Mowing is far more than a simple mechanical process—it is a critical tool for managing the intricate mosaic of grassland ecosystems. Detailed research across different regions and management contexts has revealed that the ecological effects of mowing encompass plant community composition, nutrient cycling, and invertebrate dynamics. Depending on the frequency, timing, and methods employed, mowing can foster higher biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality or lead to homogenization and decoupled ecosystem functions. Moreover, mowing does not operate in isolation; its effects are interwoven with other management practices such as grazing and burning, each adding layers of complexity to grassland dynamics.

For practitioners and researchers alike, the key takeaway is the importance of context specificity and the balancing of multiple management objectives. Adaptive mowing regimes, integration with cutting-edge monitoring techniques, and the careful coordination with other land-use practices are strategies that promise to enhance the sustainability and biodiversity of grasslands. Given the complexities outlined in this report, future work should continue to adopt long-term and multi-scale methodologies to fully harness the potential of mowing in maintaining resilient and multifunctional grassland ecosystems.
