# Final Report: The Impact of Grassland Management Extensification on Soil Microbial Diversity

This document provides an in‐depth analysis of how grassland management extensification influences soil microbial diversity, leveraging evidence and insights from recent research. The report spans multiple aspects of the topic, including underlying edaphic drivers, microbial necromass dynamics, the role of management practices, and the integration of advanced modelling techniques. While our analysis synthesizes a variety of learnings, we also discuss potential research gaps and propose innovative avenues for further study.

## 1. Introduction and Context

Grassland ecosystems are complex and dynamic environments where soil microbial communities play an essential role in nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and overall ecosystem functioning. The management of these systems—whether by intensification (e.g., through increased fertilization, heavy grazing, and frequent mowing) or extensification (via reduced inputs and lower disturbance)—has a profound impact on microbial community structure. The core inquiry addressed in this report is whether grassland management extensification reduces soil microbial diversity. We consider not only taxonomic diversity (i.e., the variety and abundance of microbial taxa such as bacteria, fungi, and archaea) but also functional diversity, which reflects the roles these organisms perform within the ecosystem.

In developing our synthesis, we also address additional questions: What are the relevant geographic scopes (e.g., temperate, Mediterranean, tropical ecosystems) and how might underlying edaphic and climatic conditions interact with management practices to modulate soil microbial communities? What mechanisms—ranging from shifts in nutrient availability to changes in physical soil structure and aggregate formation—mediate the relationship between management intensity and microbial diversity?

## 2. Edaphic Drivers of Microbial Diversity

A substantial body of research confirms that edaphic factors are primary drivers of soil microbial community structure. Specifically:

- **Soil pH, Clay Content, and Nutrient Levels:** These parameters often account for up to 23–24% of the variance observed in microbial diversity metrics (both fungal and prokaryotic) through redundancy and Mantel analyses. Soil pH not only affects microbial enzyme activity but also influences the availability of nutrients such as total nitrogen (N) and available phosphorus (P).

- **Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) and Mineral Associations:** SOC stabilization appears governed via two pathways: an in vivo route that emphasizes microbial biomass and necromass formation, and an ex vivo route involving the sorption of depolymerization products onto mineral surfaces. Key findings indicate that microbial carbon use efficiency tends to be low (<0.2), which highlights that a significant proportion of organic carbon ends up as necromass—predominantly fungal in origin (exceeding 65% of necromass)—with strong implications for long‐term SOC sequestration.

These findings underscore that soil microbial diversity is highly sensitive to intrinsic soil properties and that management practices must be evaluated against this complex biochemical backdrop.

## 3. Microbial Necromass and Carbon Sequestration Dynamics

### 3.1. Role of Microbial Necromass

Recent insights suggest that microbial necromass constitutes one of the major building blocks of soil organic carbon. For instance, necromass has been shown to account for 51% in cropland, 47% in grassland, and 35% in forest topsoils. In this context, fungi are particularly significant contributors due to their higher biomass and slower degradation rates relative to bacteria. This preferential preservation enhances SOC stability, especially in soils with higher clay content where mineral-associated fractions become predominant.

### 3.2. Warming and its Implications

Empirical evidence from alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau indicates that warming scenarios (e.g., following RCP8.5 projections) can lead to marked increases in topsoil microbial necromass carbon (MNC)—from an average of 10.96 mg/g to 18.45 mg/g, which corresponds to a ~68% increase. This effect is non-uniform across ecosystems, with edaphic properties and climatic conditions acting as key moderators. Such warming-induced shifts in necromass accumulation have direct repercussions on soil carbon budgets and community structure dynamics.

## 4. Influence of Grassland Management Practices

Management practices in grassland ecosystems can be broadly categorized into intensification and extensification strategies, each with distinct impacts on the soil microbiome.

### 4.1. Intensive Management

Intensive management practices, including high fertilization rates, heavy grazing, and frequent mowing, have been widely studied for their ability to alter microbial community composition. Key observations include:

- **Shifts in Community Composition:** There is a distinct enrichment for copiotrophs alongside shifts toward indicator taxa specialized in nitrogen cycling [e.g., Rhodococcus and Paracoccus]. These changes are often accompanied by an increase in the copiotroph:oligotroph ratio.

- **Impairment of Fungal Richness:** Evidence suggests that while bacterial richness may increase under intensive regimes, fungal richness often declines. For instance, studies have observed decreased fungal ASV (amplicon sequence variant) richness in intensive pastures compared to their extensively managed counterparts.

- **Accelerated Nutrient Mineralization:** Intensively managed systems may experience rapid decomposition and mineralization of organic matter. The resulting higher microbial respiration and turnover potentially reduce the accumulation of stable SOC and microbial necromass, thereby compromising long‐term carbon sequestration.

### 4.2. Extensive Management and Extensification

In contrast, grassland management extensification—which implies reducing external inputs and disturbances—appears to have more nuanced effects:

- **Enhanced Oligotrophic and Fungal Communities:** Extensively managed grasslands typically benefit from lower nutrient inputs and higher plant diversity, which in turn promote oligotroph-dominated communities. The diversity of fungal taxa is usually better preserved in such settings, contributing to more recalcitrant SOC fractions, particularly within the mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) pools.

- **Balanced Microbial Functions:** The formation of stable soil aggregates and a broad spectrum of microbial functions, including enhanced carbon sequestration, are often more pronounced under extensive management. This balanced environment supports a heterogeneous microbial assemblage that may be more resilient to environmental fluctuations.

- **Indicator Taxa Variability:** Distinct microbial taxa serve as indicators of various management regimes. In extensively managed systems, taxa tend to be more diverse, reflecting heterogeneous nutrient cycles and less disturbance.

Overall, extensive management practices can support a higher relative abundance of oligotrophic microorganisms that, through slower turnover and effective integration into stable SOC pools, enhance the soil’s capacity to sequester carbon over the long term.

## 5. Modelling Soil Microbial Dynamics

The utilization of advanced modelling approaches has provided significant insights into microbial community dynamics in relation to management practices:

- **Phase-Space Diagnostic Models:** Such models have been instrumental in demonstrating that SOC stabilization predominantly occurs via an in vivo pathway characterized by microbial necromass accumulation. Low parameter values for depolymerized carbon transfer (<10% ex vivo) emphasize the importance of in situ microbial processes.

- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques:** Models employing random forest algorithms and stacked autoencoders (integrating ‘eco-cluster’ relative abundances) have successfully predicted the spatial distribution of microbial necromass (MNC). These approaches integrate climatic factors (e.g., mean annual temperature, precipitation, aridity index) with soil properties (e.g., pH, texture, clay content) and plant-derived indices (e.g., NDVI, net primary productivity).

The advanced modelling frameworks underscore how subtle variations in management (intensive versus extensive) interact with environmental drivers to shape soil microbial diversity and functionality.

## 6. Underlying Mechanisms and Aggregation Processes

### 6.1. Role of Soil Aggregates and Mineral Associations

The formation of stable soil aggregates (e.g., >63 μm) and the partitioning within silt-and-clay fractions are critical for understanding SOC dynamics. Particularly in carbon-rich soils, stable aggregates are the dominant mechanism for SOC stabilization, while in SOC-poor soils, mineral associations are relatively less susceptible to microbial degradation. These physical processes are intimately linked to microbial necromass dynamics and are modulated by management practices that influence soil disturbance and residue input.

### 6.2. Interactive Effects of External Factors

Beyond management practices alone, external conditions such as climate (e.g., temperature, soil moisture) and land use practices (e.g., no-till, residue retention, crop rotations) further dictate microbial physiological responses. For instance:

- **Warming Effects:** As warming alters microbial carbon use efficiency, it consequently shifts the balance between respiration and biomass accumulation. Such changes are measurable through altered accumulation patterns of microbial necromass.

- **Nutrient Inputs and Disturbance:** Management practices that reduce nutrient inputs or disturb soil less frequently tend to support the formation of a more recalcitrant SOC pool through robust aggregate formation and enhanced organo-mineral interactions.

## 7. Synthesis and Future Directions

### 7.1. Integrating Edaphic and Management Drivers

The research synthesis reveals that while grassland management extensification might not uniformly reduce overall microbial diversity—particularly taxonomic richness—it does result in significant shifts in the functional and structural attributes of the soil microbial community. Extensification supports a microbial community that is more oligotroph-dominated and fungal-rich, which is beneficial for SOC stabilization and long-term carbon sequestration.

### 7.2. Policy and Management Implications

Based on the integrated research findings:

- **Mosaic Management Strategies:** A combination of management regimes (i.e., a mosaic approach) may be optimal. Such an approach would include zones of both intensification and extensification, designed to maximize the diversity of microbial taxa and functional groups. This strategy may help to sustain overall below‐ground biodiversity and enhance ecological resilience.

- **Tailored Management Based on Edaphic Conditions:** Given how strongly soil pH, clay content, and nutrient levels modulate microbial responses, management practices should be tailored to local edaphic conditions. This could involve adaptive management strategies where soil amendments are precisely managed to balance productivity and microbial health.

### 7.3. Emerging Research Avenues

Several promising lines of inquiry emerge from this synthesis:

1. **Examination of Microbial Indicators in Diverse Ecosystems:** Further research should focus on comparing microbial indicator taxa across different grassland ecosystems (e.g., temperate versus tropical) under similar management extents to evaluate the generalizability of current findings.

2. **Mechanistic Studies on Necromass Stability:** There is a need for detailed mechanistic studies on how varying degrees of management-induced disturbance affect the persistence and biochemical composition of microbial necromass, particularly in relation to mineral-associated organic matter.

3. **Integration of High-Resolution Modelling with Remote Sensing:** Advances in machine learning and remote sensing (e.g., high-resolution NDVI and other plant-derived indices) could further refine predictions of microbial community responses to climate and management. Leveraging these technologies should be prioritized to map spatial variability at finer scales.

4. **Implications of Climate Change Synergies:** Given that warming scenarios (and associated changes in precipitation patterns) significantly influence microbial processes, future work should prioritize understanding how climate change synergistically interacts with grassland management to affect soil biodiversity and carbon cycling.

## 8. Conclusion

The cumulative research suggests that while extensification of grassland management does not necessarily reduce microbial diversity in a simplistic manner, it fundamentally alters microbial community composition and functionality. Extensively managed systems tend to promote oligotrophic, often fungal-dominated communities that enhance the formation of recalcitrant SOC fractions. In contrast, intensive management results in a shift towards copiotroph-dominated communities with rapid nutrient turnover, potentially compromising long-term soil carbon sequestration.

The interplay between edaphic factors, climate, and management practices is complex and central to determining the overall health and function of soil microbial communities. Future management practices should thus adopt integrative, site-specific strategies that consider both the ecological benefits and the trade-offs involved. Innovative modelling approaches, combined with targeted field experiments, will be invaluable in designing such adaptive management frameworks.
