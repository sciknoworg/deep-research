## 1. Introduction

Phragmites australis, commonly known as the common reed, appears in both native and invasive Old World haplotypes. In near-urban areas, invasive forms can lead to significant ecological trade-offs. While Phragmites can provide ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration, nutrient uptake, and maintenance of certain habitat functions) due to its high biomass production, its aggressive spread often comes at the expense of native biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity. This critical review examines methods for management tailored to near-urban contexts, balancing eradication or containment efforts with habitat enhancement objectives under varying regulatory and environmental constraints.

## 2. Management Objectives and Context

### 2.1 Defining Clear Objectives

Before implementing a management technique, a clear definition of the management objectives is essential:

- **Complete Eradication vs. Containment:** Is the aim to remove Phragmites entirely, or to maintain it at levels below a defined threshold (<5% areal cover is sometimes indicated for sensitive species)?
- **Habitats for Native Species:** Should the strategy also include the rehabilitation of native species and restoration of ecological functions?
- **Ecosystem Services:** How might any residual Phragmites biomass be used to offer ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration and water filtration?

In near-urban settings, additional pressures (e.g., adjacent impervious surfaces, human disturbance, regulations regarding water quality) make integrated, multi-objective management particularly challenging.

### 2.2 Environmental and Regulatory Considerations

Near-urban sites are characterized by a dynamic interplay of hydrological, ecological, and anthropogenic pressures. Key factors include:

- **Water Management Conditions:** Urban watersheds have altered hydrology—from stormwater runoff to changes in channel connectivity. Real-time data on water quality, flow regimes, and substrate conditions are critical. Adaptive permitting frameworks that can integrate metrics like epibenthic substrate quality or fish passage metrics can help fine-tune management thresholds.
- **Sensitive Species and Habitat Requirements:** Protection of sensitive native species creates a regulatory imperative to monitor ecosystem responses post-intervention using techniques like line-intercept transects and repeated annual sampling.
- **Local Regulations:** Permitting processes (e.g., USACE, MDDNR guidance) must adapt to rapid changes in hydrologic connectivity and urban disturbances. This requires integration of community science data with agency-collected metrics to establish flexible performance thresholds.

In urban contexts, adaptive management frameworks that rely on real-time monitoring and iterative decision-making (linked to Bayesian updating and management strategy evaluation—a multi-year target-setting process) have proven effective in dynamically adjusting removals and restoration interventions.

## 3. Synthesis of Research Learnings

### 3.1 Spatial Prioritization and Effort Allocation

Research from invasive species management in river systems (e.g., adaptive watershed restoration in the Anacostia system) illustrates the benefits of spatial prioritization. Approaches such as Epicenter, High Invasion, and Linear prioritizations help allocate limited effort effectively. Key takeaways include:

- **Optimal Detection and Eradication Probabilities:** Studies have indicated that target probabilities of around 0.5 (detection) and 0.75 (eradication) are realistic, influencing decisions on resource allocation (typically 20–60 hours per week). In a near-urban 1-hectare stand, prioritizing epicenters that are most likely to serve as sources for further invasion would be crucial.
- **Risk Tolerance and Invasion Stage:** Strategies must differ based on whether the management site represents an established or an emerging invasion. In more established stands, a robust, multi-year approach combining chemical and mechanical treatments may be required.

### 3.2 Integrated Permitting and Data-Driven Decision-Making

Adaptive permitting frameworks must account for both rigorous agency-collected data and community-sourced observations. This is essential for:

- **Ecosystem Performance Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of variables such as percent cover, seed output, and vegetation composition feeds into dynamic permitting. This data-driven approach allows thresholds to be recalibrated as the intervention progresses.
- **Real-time Management Adjustments:** Bayesian updating methodologies and dynamic multistate occupancy models help assess the immediate impacts of interventions. Such iterative adjustments in action can reduce re-invasion risks by ensuring that performance standards (e.g., maintain invasive cover below 5%) are met and sustained.

### 3.3 Best Management Practices (BMPs) and Adaptive Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

A review of BMPs by agencies including the USDA Forest Service and the California Invasive Plant Council suggest that an integrated IPM approach, particularly for Phragmites, is optimal. Key components include:

- **Combined Mechanical and Chemical Treatments:** Integrated approaches that combine targeted herbicide applications (with an increasing role for drone technology for precision) with mechanical removal (e.g., winter mowing, which according to multi-site experiments, can enhance control) have shown efficacy. In near-urban watersheds, ensuring that drift and non-target impacts are minimized is paramount.

- **Timing of Treatments:** Studies indicate that fall-applied herbicides, paired with subsequent winter mowing, are more effective in reducing cover and inflorescence compared to summer treatments. This timing is particularly sensitive to factors such as soil moisture, which also benefits native species recruitment.

- **Long-term Monitoring:** A 40-year review underscores the importance of extended monitoring beyond short-term interventions. Too often, eradication appears successful in the short term but fails to inhibit reinvasion as ecosystem-level recovery for native plants is not monitored beyond a few seasons.

### 3.4 Multi-Dimensional Urban Analysis and Ecosystem Services

In near-urban areas, the interplay between urbanization and ecological management is complex:

- **Metrics of Urbanization:** The integration of impervious surface cover, road density, and the overall urban 'cocktail' into the management framework is crucial. Understanding these stressors can help fine-tune the thresholds and adaptive management targets.

- **Ecosystem Heterogeneity:** Insights from urban waterbody studies (e.g., Oertli et al.) indicate that designing heterogeneous pond habitats—with consideration for optimized pond sizes and varied margin structures—can enhance ecosystem services such as water purification and flood control. While Phragmites removal may target invasive dominance, secondary interventions aimed at habitat reconstruction for native species should integrate these metrics.

- **Ecosystem Services of Phragmites:** It is important to acknowledge the ecosystem functions provided by Phragmites in terms of biomass, carbon sequestration, and soil nutrient cycling. A balance might need to be struck where complete eradication may be less desirable if the ecosystem services are being significantly leveraged. This further argues for a management approach that might incorporate containment rather than complete removal, if local conditions support native species restoration concurrently.

### 3.5 Technology and Innovation in Management Practices

Recent advancements in drone technology, real-time satellite and UAV imaging, and sensor-based hydrological monitoring have enhanced the precision and effectiveness of invasive species control. Specific recommendations include:

- **Precision Herbicide Application:** Drones outfitted with GPS and sensors enable targeted herbicide applications that minimize off-target damage. This is especially valuable in near-urban areas where collateral impacts to non-target flora (and potential aesthetic or legislative issues) need to be minimized.

- **Mechanized Removal and Remote Monitoring:** Coupling mechanical removal with real-time monitoring allows managers to adjust methods over a multi-year timeframe. Integrating continuous data streams with adaptive management frameworks provides a science-based feedback loop that informs permit adjustments, necessary additional interventions, or alterations in restoration objectives.

- **Integrated Data Platforms:** Establishing centralized platforms that combine data from rigorous, agency-driven monitoring and community science observations ensures that local fluctuations (such as changes in local hydrologic regimes) are rapidly incorporated into management decisions.

## 4. Proposed Management Strategy for the 1-Hectare Phragmites Stand

Based on the research learnings and best practices identified, the following multi-year, integrated management strategy is proposed:

### 4.1 Phase I: Comprehensive Site Assessment and Objective Setting

- **Baseline Data Collection:** Utilize line-intercept transects, hydrological surveys, and mapping (using UAV and drone imagery) to quantify current Phragmites cover, seed output, biomass, and distribution. Assess soil moisture regimes and hydrological connectivity.
- **Stakeholder and Regulatory Alignment:** Engage local regulatory agencies (USACE, relevant state departments) and integrate community science data platforms to establish adaptive performance thresholds based on local urban stressors.
- **Objective Definition:** Clearly define whether management will pursue complete eradication, spatial containment, or a combination strategy that includes promoting native species. This should incorporate thresholds (e.g., Phragmites cover should be maintained at <5%) and ecosystem service metrics.

### 4.2 Phase II: Integrated Control Measures and Adaptive Permitting

- **Chemical and Mechanical Interventions:** Implement fall-applied herbicides (e.g., glyphosate) followed by winter mowing. Optimize treatment times based on real-time soil moisture data to ensure both effective Phragmites suppression and promotion of native recruitment.
- **Drone and Remote Sensing Utilization:** Use drone technology for targeted herbicide applications and to continually update the treatment map. This minimizes non-target impacts in near-urban areas and allows for rapid response in emerging hotspots.
- **Adaptive Permitting:** Apply flexible permitting frameworks that allow parameters to be adjusted in response to real-time data. Define action thresholds informed by both rigorous monitoring and community science observations, and include performance standards such as percent cover, biomass reduction, and native species recovery indices.

### 4.3 Phase III: Restoration and Long-Term Monitoring

- **Native Species Reintroduction:** Concurrent with Phragmites suppression, develop a native vegetation restoration program. Use insights from studies on urban waterbody heterogeneity to reintroduce native species along varied margin structures and design small-scale microhabitats that promote biodiversity.
- **Integrated Monitoring and Feedback:** Develop an integrated monitoring system using dynamic multistate occupancy models and Bayesian updating. This system should continuously monitor cover, seed banks, soil nutrient profiles, and hydrological variables to guide additional interventions.
- **Iterative Adaptive Management:** Over a multi-year horizon (minimum 5–10 years), iteratively review performance outcomes relative to established thresholds. Adjust treatments (e.g., increase removal efforts, modify herbicide dosage or timing) based on observed trends, and update regulatory permits as needed.

### 4.4 Phase IV: Engaging Stakeholders and Policy Feedback

- **Community Involvement:** Engage community groups in monitoring through citizen science initiatives, ensuring local buy-in and supplementing high-resolution, on-ground data with remote sensing.
- **Policy and Permit Adaptation:** Use results from the integrated monitoring framework to inform policy and adaptive permitting, ensuring management strategies reflect both ecological responses and urban regulatory updates. This encourages a continuous loop of data-driven decision making.
- **Knowledge Dissemination:** Document the process and outcomes to contribute to the wider field of invasive species management. Sharing results through academic and regulatory channels ensures that insights can be adaptively integrated into larger watershed management strategies.

## 5. Challenges and Considerations

### 5.1 Trade-offs and Ecosystem Services

Any management strategy must balance the dual roles of Phragmites as an invasive threat and as a provider of certain ecosystem services (e.g., carbon storage, nutrient uptake). Practitioners must weigh the benefits of complete eradication against potential losses in ecosystem services. In scenarios where complete eradication might compromise ecological function, a strategy of partial suppression combined with native species restoration might be more appropriate.

### 5.2 Long-Term Commitment and Resource Allocation

Multi-year commitment and sustained resource investment (in terms of both personnel hours and technological inputs) are prerequisites for success. Historical analyses reveal that short-term treatments rarely yield long-term outcomes, so incorporating multi-annual monitoring and adaptive management is non-negotiable.

### 5.3 Uncertainty in Urban Ecosystem Dynamics

The near-urban context is marked by dynamic environmental and anthropogenic pressures. Uncertainties associated with urban stormwater events, rapid land-use changes, and evolving regulatory mandates mean that flexibility in management approaches is essential. Real-time monitoring and adaptive management are the primary tools to navigate this complexity.
