# Invasive Species, Pollination‐Network Disruption and Native Pollinator Communities in Tropical Mountains – An Integrative Review  
*Prepared 2025-06-03*

## 1. Why Tropical Montane Pollination Systems Merit Special Attention

1. Elevational stratification and extreme β-diversity make tropical mountains (Andes, Eastern Arc, New Guinea Highlands, Himalaya, Meso-American cordilleras, Mt Kinabalu, Central African Albertine Rift, Hawaiian shield volcanoes) global centres of plant–pollinator co-diversification.   
2. Climatic isotherm compression means a 1 °C warming lifts isotherms ~125–150 m and can wipe out entire elevational bands; montane endemics frequently “run out of mountain”. Species distribution models (SDMs) for 32 Himalayan *Bombus* spp. predict ≤10 % range retention for 72 % of species by 2050, and ≥90 % habitat loss for 13–15 taxa by 2070.  
3. Steep sociological gradients: small-holder shade coffee, tea, cardamom and high-value fruit/vegetables dominate sub-montane belts; land scarcity fosters aggressive introduction of alien crops, trees (e.g., *Pinus*, *Cryptomeria*, *Acacia*), groundcovers and managed pollinators (European honey bee, *Bombus terrestris*, leafcutter bees).  
4. Islands-in-the-sky topography fragments populations; metapopulation rescue is weak so any network destabilisation reverberates faster than in contiguous lowlands.

Bottom-line: montane ecosystems exhibit both the *highest stakes* and the *lowest functional redundancy*, making them exquisitely sensitive to invasive organisms that tamper with mutualistic webs.


## 2. Conceptual Pathways by Which Invasives Affect Pollination in Mountains

Mechanisms operate at three nested levels (Fig. 1 conceptually):  
1. **Resource‐use and Behavioural Interference**  
   • Consumptive competition for floral rewards.  
   • Aggressive displacement (*Apis mellifera scutellata* vs stingless bees).  
2. **Network Topology Reconfiguration**  
   • Addition of super-generalist nodes increases connectance, reduces modularity, drives nested centralisation (preferential attachment).  
   • Plant invaders that bloom in dearth periods (e.g., *Impatiens glandulifera* at 2000–3000 m in the Himalaya) attract otherwise specialist pollinators → rewiring.  
3. **Downstream Fitness, Demography & Ecosystem Services**  
   • Pollen quality dilution (heterospecific pollen load ↑80 %) lowers conspecific pollen deposition and seed set (≈−20 %).  
   • Crop yields, cultural keystone species (e.g., *Fuchsia boliviana* for Andean hummingbird ceremonies) threatened.


## 3. Empirical Signals from Network Metrics

| Metric | Typical direction when invasive **plants** dominate | When invasive **pollinators** dominate | Key empirical insights |
|———|———|———|———|
| Connectance | ↔ or ↑ (super-generalist links) | ↑ at *low* dominance, ↓ at >70 % dominance (native specialists drop out) | In Mediterranean scrubland augmenting observational data with pollen loads inflated connectance 1.43 × and exposed hidden modules—shows sampling artefact caution. |
| Nestedness | ↑ due to centralisation | Initially ↑, may later ↓ if native hubs lost | Nestedness increased after pollen-load inclusion; invader removal on Seychelles reduced nestedness (normalisation). |
| Modularity | ↓ if generalists integrate modules | ↑ if invader monopolises specific plant subset | Remote-sensed Asat, canopy height and leaf-P predicted 29 % of modularity variance across 209 tropical webs—useful for landscape surveillance. |
| Robustness to extinctions | Often seemingly unchanged (structural inertia) | Can be over-estimated; functional output declines | Seychelles shrub eradication ↗ robustness; but raspberry & coffee yields fell under invasive bee domination despite stable topology. |

Take-home: **Structure can be misleadingly stable; functional metrics (pollen quality, seed set, yield, rewiring capacity) are indispensable.**


## 4. Invasive Plants in Tropical Mountains

### 4.1 Canonical Case Studies

1. **Seychelles granitic inselbergs (300–550 m):**   Eradication of 39 700 exotic shrubs raised interaction diversity + 23 % and native fruit set + 17 % *within one season* (Kaiser-Bunbury 2017). Reveals rapid pollinator response where regional species pool is intact.
2. **Meso-American cloud forest → shade coffee conversion (1200–1500 m Chiapas):**  Late-successional forest and shade coffee exhibited higher modularity than cattle pasture; yet coffee networks more specialised and less robust because *Coffea* monopolised visits. Generalist hummingbirds maintained robustness in pasture—counter-intuitive role for vertebrate generalists.
3. **Andean invasive *Gentiana* spp. (speculative, flagged):**  Unpublished evidence suggests neon-blue *Gentiana* becomes floral mega-hub at 2800–3400 m, concentrating 55 % of visits of *Oreotrochilus* hummingbirds; predicted to depress visitation to endemic *Chuquiraga jussieui* by 30 % (flagged as speculative, needs testing).

### 4.2 Functional Consequences

• Native plants exposed to 80 % more heterospecific pollen (Parra-Tabla 2021) → seed set ↓20 %.  
• Seasonal resource bridging sometimes *benefits* pollinators (e.g., *Leucospermum* in South African mountains) but long-term drives community to dependence on alien phenology.

### 4.3 Traits, Remote Sensing and Forecasting

• High leaf photosynthetic rate (Asat) and water content ↑ connectance, short canopy ↑ modularity.  
• Integrating satellite leaf-trait maps with invasive-species layers could yield early-warning for network fragility hotspots (R² ≈0.2–0.3 already achievable).


## 5. Invasive Animal Pollinators in Tropical Mountains

### 5.1 Bees

1. **Africanised *Apis mellifera* (AHB):**   
   • Rapid colonisation up to 2400 m Andes and 3000 m Mexico.  
   • Once >60–70 % of visits, net yield declines – raspberry drupelet set ↓30 %, *Coffea arabica* fruit set negative correlation with AHB density.  
   • Competitive exclusion of stingless bees documented on Yungas slopes.
2. ***Bombus terrestris* commercial colonies:**   Introduced for tomato/berry greenhouses in Andean valleys → feral at 1500–3500 m. High visit rate (>15 visits flower⁻¹ h⁻¹) caused raspberry yield penalties (triploid seed failure via geitonogamy).  
3. ***Eristalis tenax* (drone fly):**   In New Zealand montane brassica, abundance ↑275 % where agriculture 40→99 %; pollen deposition ↑128 % yet evenness collapsed – illustrates “single-species over-compensation”.

### 5.2 Birds and Bats

• Hummingbirds display greater rewiring capacity than plants across Americas (Marjakangas 2025); capacity plateaus when local plant richness >75 spp., which tropical mountains typically exceed only in lower cloud zones – suggests upper-montane hummingbird assemblages are less able to adapt to floral turnover.  
• *Rousettus* fruit bats in East African mountains exploit *Eucalyptus* stands, altering movement patterns and pollen flow of native *Syzygium*. Data scarce.

### 5.3 Synergies with Climate Change

• Warming truncates cold-adapted native bee ranges (Himalayan *Bombus*) while enabling lowland invaders to climb upslope – “biotic attrition + invasion ratchet”.


## 6. From Network Alteration to Ecosystem-Service and Socio-Economic Outcomes

1. **Amazon Basin foothills (humid tropics):**  Pollination service value rose from US$ 73 m → 157 m (2006-2017), now 64 % of crop value. Dependence on bees & beetles underscores invasion risk; if alien honey-bee monoculture collapses, US$ 100 m+ at stake annually.
2. **Shade coffee landscapes (e.g., Colombia, Chiapas, Vietnam highlands):**  Invasive bee dominance linked to fruit-set decline despite high visitation. Compensation by vertebrate pollinators (bats, birds) is uncertain, risk amplified by deforestation.
3. **Cultural values:**  Pollination of ritual plants (e.g., *Schizanthus* species in Andean Quechua festivals) threatened by displaced specialist bees.
4. **Systemic vulnerability:**  Exotic fly over-compensation appears beneficial short-term but homogenises service supply → fewer functional insurance species, heightening climate-shock sensitivity.


## 7. Management and Restoration Insights

1. **Rapid Gains Possible:**  Seychelles (island granite), prairie-fen (temperate) show 1-season recovery of mobile generalist pollinators after shrub removal.
2. **Management Intensity > Land-Use Category:**  Tasman Peninsula: native bee abundance tracked native-plant genera, independent of whether site was reserve, plantation or pasture. In tropical mountains, fine-scale understory management likely trumps coarse land-use labels (e.g., “shade coffee”).
3. **Trait-Based Early-Warning:**  Combining rewiring-capacity metrics with remote-sensed vegetation traits could prioritise eradication zones.  
4. **Policy Levers:**  
   • Stricter regulation of commercial bumble-bee hive import.  
   • Ban on unmanaged *A. mellifera* colonies in high-conservation areas.  
   • Incentivise native hedgerow networks along elevational gradients to facilitate altitudinal migration corridors.


## 8. Research Frontiers and Contrarian Ideas

1. **Hidden Specialisation Revealed by Multi-modal Sampling:**  Visual surveys under-estimate niche partitioning; pollen-load DNA metabarcoding needed to avoid false security about “generalist” invaders.  
2. **Predictive Modelling of Network Collapse Thresholds:**  Integrate SDMs (for future climate) with interaction-trait hypervolumes (rewiring capacity) to forecast when invaders push systems past tipping point – proof-of-concept in progress for Andes.  
3. **Assisted Up-Migration of Native Pollinators (speculative):**  Rearing cold-tolerant *Bombus* or *Xylocopa* and releasing at higher elevations ahead of warming could pre-empt invasive takeover; politically sensitive and ecologically risky.  
4. **Payment for Pollination Stability:**  Crop certification premiums for farms that limit invasive-bee densities and maintain ≥X native pollinator richness.


## 9. Synthesis and Recommendations

1. **Focus on Function, Not Only Form:**  Network metrics may stay deceptively constant; measure pollen quality, seed set and yield.  
2. **Prioritise Elevational Corridors:**  Ensure contiguous native-floral strips from foothills to alpine zone to buffer displacement pressures.  
3. **Early Detection and Rapid Response (EDRR) of Animal Invaders:**  Once *B. terrestris* establishes in highlands eradication is near-impossible.  
4. **Leverage Remote Sensing + Trait Databases:**  Operationalise Asat, leaf-P, canopy height as proxies for interaction robustness.  
5. **Embrace Adaptive Governance:**  Co-manage coffee / tea landscapes with local cooperatives; include cultural-service metrics in cost–benefit.


## 10. Key Knowledge Gaps

• **Tropical highland bats and nocturnal bees:** virtually unstudied.  
• **Longitudinal datasets:** need >10-y time-series to detect lagged invasion impacts.  
• **Socio-economic resilience modelling:** link pollination instability to smallholder income volatility under market + climate shocks.
