## 1  Executive summary

Alien (non-native) plants rarely invade alone; they arrive embedded in a web of mutualists, enemies, and ecosystem-engineering co-invaders (notably European earthworms in North America). Synthesising >20 quantitative studies and recent meta-analyses, we identify four dominant impact pathways (Fig. 1):

1. **Resource pre-emption and direct competition** reduce resident plant abundance by 40–50 % on average (Vilà et al. 2011), but effect size diverges with growth form (woody ≫ herbaceous) and canopy closure (van Hengstum 2013; Abgrall 2019).  
2. **Mutualist disruption / re-wiring**—especially of mycorrhizal, pollinator, and seed-disperser networks—leads to regeneration bottlenecks that can outweigh direct competition (Peay 2018).  
3. **Enemy release + novel specialist accumulation** transiently favour invaders yet precipitate trophic collapses of predators and parasitoids downstream.  
4. **Ecosystem engineering of the detrital pathway** (litter chemistry, earthworm invasion) flips soil food webs from fungal- to bacterial-dominated channels, accelerates C and nutrient turnover, and erodes long-term site fertility (Dempsey 2013; Resner 2014; Jang 2022).

Impacts unfold hierarchically in time: species losses → network rewiring → biogeochemical legacies (Wardle 2017). By the time altered N or C cycling becomes detectable, major biodiversity debts are already incurred.

Management levers exist—e.g. manipulating soil N:P to steer mycorrhizal succession, rapid seeding of key ectomycorrhizal (EcM) partners, and pre-emptive control of co-invading earthworms—but demand integrated above–below-ground monitoring.

## 2  Scope and definitions

• Alien plant: established outside its historical biogeographic range through human agency.  
• Recipient community: the suite of plants, microbes, and consumers present before invasion.  
• Focus: temperate to boreal forests and grasslands where **European earthworms, arbuscular- (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi**, and resident arthropod guilds provide the strongest empirical base. Many mechanisms generalise to tropical or wetland systems but require separate parameterisation.

## 3  Mechanistic pathways

### 3.1  Direct resource competition

Alien plants typically exhibit higher specific leaf area, photosynthetic capacity, and plasticity, allowing rapid canopy closure and soil moisture draw-down. A global meta-analysis (Vilà et al. 2011, *n* = 1041 comparisons) documented a **47 % mean drop in resident plant richness** and similar declines in above-ground biomass. Woody invaders cause deeper diversity losses than herbaceous ones (-55 vs -27 % arthropod abundance; van Hengstum 2013).

### 3.2  Mutualist disruption and limitation

1. **Mycorrhizal guild shifts**  
   • EcM-dominated forests hold ≈ 70 % more soil C than AM forests (Soudzilovskaia 2015; Barceló 2023). Alien AM shrubs or trees (e.g. *Elaeagnus*, *Acer platanoides*) displace EcM hosts, lowering extraradical mycelium biomass and destabilising C.  
   • Greenhouse trials (Peay 2018) showed that delaying EcM spore arrival by ≥41 d cut *Pinus muricata* seedling mass 4–8×—a **“mutualist-arrival window”** that invaders can exploit by altering spore dispersal corridors.

2. **Pollinator and seed-disperser network rewiring**  
   Not covered in the provided learnings but well established elsewhere; key takeaway: generalist alien flowers attract pollinators away from native specialists, leading to pollen limitation.

### 3.3  Enemy release and trophic cascades

• Primary consumers may temporarily increase (+30–67 % in closed-canopy forests; Abgrall 2019), but predator richness often stagnates, flattening trophic pyramids.  
• Nitrogen-fixing aliens elevate foliar N, boosting herbivore performance yet ultimately losing the initial advantage as enemy assemblages adapt.

### 3.4  Ecosystem engineering via litter and soil modification

#### 3.4.1  Earthworm–plant–fungus feedbacks

In North American glaciated regions, **alien European earthworms** co-invade alongside horticultural and forage plants. Key findings:

• Invasive worms **cut AMF & EMF networks**; *Quercus rubra* AMF colonisation falls ~40 % while fine-root biomass losses run ≈14 % yr⁻¹ (Gilbert 2014; Dobson 2019).  
• Conversely, in low-residue agro-soils or LDPE-polluted fields, worms can **vector AMF spores and raise AMF abundance by 45 %**, boosting fruit yield by 188 % (Yang 2020; Liu 2023)
    → Impact is **context-dependent**: beneficial under C-poor cropping, detrimental in C-rich forests.

#### 3.4.2  Chronosequence evidence

1. **Guild turnover**: epigeic → epi-endogeic → endogeic dominance within ≤20 yr (Dempsey 2013; Lejoly 2023).  
2. **Soil C re-partitioning**: O-horizon loss, macro-aggregate breakdown, SOC shift into less stable mineral fractions.  
3. **Nutrient exhaustion**: Resner 2014 documented >90 % collapse of Ca, Mg, K, P/Zr enrichments once geo-mixing endogeics establish.  
4. **Microbiome flip**: oligotrophic Acidobacteria → copiotrophic Bacteroidota; nitrifier dominance → denitrifier/N-fixer dominance (Jang 2022), leading to gaseous N loss.

#### 3.4.3  Functional–taxonomic decoupling in fungi

Following severe disturbance, AM richness rebounds quickly yet functional composition (e.g. nutrient uptake genes) tracks soil N:P (>16 enhances AM recovery; German open-cast mining chronosequence). Thus, **stoichiometry is a management lever**.

## 4  Temporal hierarchy of impacts

Wardle (2017) and Vilà (2011) argue for three phases:

1. **Immediate (<5 yr)**: changes in species abundance/cover; mutualist arrival windows; epigeic worm litter fragmentation.  
2. **Intermediate (5–20 yr)**: rewiring of trophic and mutualistic networks; arrival of endogeic worms; detectable shifts in soil microbial guilds.  
3. **Legacy (>20 yr)**: loss of organic horizons, nutrient capital, and SOC; persistent biotic homogenisation even after invader removal.

## 5  Meta-analytic constraints and generalities

Variable | Mean Hedges’ *d* (Vilà 2011) | Notes
---|---|---
Plant richness | –1.03 | ≈ 40–50 % drop
Animal richness | –0.98 | Arthropods most sensitive
Plant production | +0.57 | Driven by N-fixers, early succession
Soil available N | +0.54 | But long-term losses if earthworms expel N as N₂O

Island vs mainland effects are statistically indistinguishable, challenging the “islands are more vulnerable” paradigm.

## 6  Integrated conceptual model (text only)

1. **Alien plant establishment** → higher SLA & growth → rapid litter inputs with novel chemistry (often lower lignin:N).  
2. **Litter shift** facilitates epigeic earthworms that fragment O-horizon.  
3. **Progression to endogeic worms** geo-mixes upper 20 cm, severing fungal hyphae, driving AMF/EcM decline, and leaching base cations.  
4. **Microbiome transitions** from fungal to bacterial, nitrifier to denitrifier, accelerate C & N turnover.  
5. **Nutrient depletion & mycorrhizal loss** feed back to suppress late-successional natives, locking in invader dominance.

---

## 7  Management and restoration implications

1. **Early detection of mutualist limitation**: spore traps and qPCR of EcM indicator taxa can flag risk windows for native conifer recruitment (cf. Peay 2018).  
2. **Stoichiometric steering**: adjusting soil N:P (fertiliser blends, tailored cover crops) can tilt fungal guilds toward desired AM or EcM dominance.  
3. **Earthworm barriers**: physical (metal flashing), chemical (saponins), or habitat (coarse woody debris) barriers prior to endogeic phase delay nutrient collapse.  
4. **Functional over taxonomic targets**: restoration success correlates with recovering fungal functional traits (enzyme suites, mycelial architecture) rather than OTU richness per se.  
5. **Trait-based invader risk screening**: combine plant lignin:N, mycorrhizal type, and likelihood of co-transporting annelid cocoons to triage high-impact species.

### Novel / contrarian ideas (speculative – flagged):

• Deploying **synthetic biology** to engineer saprotrophic fungi that out-compete worm-favoured copiotrophs, re-establishing slower C cycles (speculative TRL 2–3).  
• Using **electric or vibrational soil barriers** tuned to deter earthworm migration without pesticides (prototype stage).  
• Implementing **real-time eDNA + machine learning dashboards** that integrate airborne pollen, soil eDNA, and acoustic insect data to detect interaction-network rewiring before visual symptoms.

## 8  Research gaps and priorities

1. **Multiplex ecological network models** linking plant–pollinator, plant–mycorrhizal, and detrital food webs under invasion scenarios.  
2. **Long-term paired chrono-sequences vs manipulative experiments** to disentangle invasion age from environmental covariates.  
3. **Remote sensing of fungal guilds** (e.g. SWIR hyperspectral + machine-trained spectral libraries) to map EcM vs AM dominance at landscape scale.  
4. **Quantifying co-invasion feedbacks** (worms × plants × plastic pollution) across land-use gradients.

---

## 9  Conclusions

Alien plants restructure recipient communities through an intertwined suite of competitive, mutualistic, trophic, and ecosystem-engineering mechanisms. Below-ground changes—especially those mediated by co-invading earthworms—are both rapid and profound, severing mycorrhizal networks, altering microbial guild balance, and depleting long-term nutrient and carbon stocks. Because functional recovery, not mere taxonomic return, governs ecosystem resilience, management must integrate stoichiometric manipulation, mutualist augmentation, and barriers to soil-engineer co-invaders. Failure to act within the mutualist-arrival window may lock ecosystems into lower-diversity, faster-cycling, and less carbon-rich states for decades.
