## 1. Purpose and Framing

The purpose of this report is three-fold:

1. **Synthesize** the current evidence on the drivers of insect declines in Europe, integrating the most recent primary studies, meta-analyses and long-term monitoring assets ("learnings").  
2. **Respond** to the scoping questions raised by the commissioning analyst regarding taxonomic focus, quantitative versus qualitative treatment of drivers, and temporal / geographic granularity.  
3. **Surface** additional, forward-looking considerations—data innovations, contrarian interpretations, and policy hooks—that could sharpen an upcoming systematic review or assessment.

The audience is assumed to be expert; terminology is therefore left technical and argumentation evidence-centred rather than authority-centred.

## 2. Empirical Signal: How Severe, Where, and for Whom?

### 2.1 Pan-European Decline Indicators

| Metric | Spatial coverage | Period | Change | Key source(s) |
|--------|------------------|--------|--------|---------------|
|Flying-insect biomass (malaise traps) | 63 German nature reserves | 1989–2016 | −75 % | Hallmann 2017; corroborating resampling 1989–2014 shows −82 % hoverfly abundance/biomass and −23 % seasonal spp. richness |
|Multi-taxon abundance | 21 sites, 13 European countries | 1951–1997 vs 1998–2018 | −47 % | Møller 2020 |
|Butterflies (UK) | >3,000 BMS sites | 1976–2018 | −50 % | UKBMS 2019 |
|Grassland butterflies (EU) | 17 EU states | 1990–2017 | −39 % | van Swaay 2020 |
|Moths (GBR) | Rothamsted network | 1968–2018 | −31 % abundance | Conrad 2022 |

The aggregate evidence thus indicates multi-decadal losses ≥40 % in abundance/biomass for many aerial taxa, with lepidopterans showing parallel, albeit slightly lower, declines.

### 2.2 Not All Decline, But Marked Turnover

• A **Swiss national archive** of 1.45 M insect occurrence records (390 spp., 1980–2020) shows *no net species loss* but strong **community turnover**: cold-adapted habitat specialists lost 58 % of occupied 5 × 5 km squares while warm-adapted generalists gained 71 %. >80 % of the variance is attributable to **temperature rise**; regional land-use change was secondary.

• **Palaeoecological baselines** (>2,200 fossil insect samples from 589 European sites) reveal that Late-Holocene land-use change (Neolithic–Bronze Age) impacted beetle communities as strongly as the last deglacial climate shift (~11 ka BP), illustrating that insect assemblages have always been dynamic but are now exposed to *multiple rapid drivers simultaneously*.

### 2.3 Taxon-Specific Nuances

‐ **Non-bee flower visitors (Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera)** account for 38–40 % of visits to 17 major crops world-wide. Although their per-visit efficiency is 30–50 % lower than bees, frequency compensates; they provide **independent gains in fruit set**, especially when honey-bee visitation saturates.

‐ **Diptera** often increase in high-intensity landscapes (see §4.4) whereas **Hymenoptera & Lepidoptera** decline more steeply, pointing to functional as well as taxonomic idiosyncrasies.

‐ **Seasonality and scale matter**: at German reserves, daily hoverfly species richness fell 82 %, but seasonal gamma-richness only 23 %. Biomass decline is therefore nearly isometric with abundance, while richness loss displays strong spatial–temporal scaling.

### 2.4 Latitudinal & Habitat Gradients

‐ Abundance declines are steeper at **35–45 ° N (Mediterranean, SW Balkans)** than in Scandinavia; 
‐ Loss of fallows (8 % of EU arable land in 1994 → <1 % by 2012) and forest encroachment into open habitats diminish floral resources and microclimatic heterogeneity, impacting thermophilous specialists disproportionately; 
‐ Urbanisation and **artificial light at night (ALAN)** exert additional pressure on nocturnal taxa.

## 3. Causal Drivers – Weight of Evidence

The table below integrates *all* compiled learnings, classifying strength of inference:

| Driver | Strength of empirical attribution | Key evidence bullets | Knowledge gaps |
|--------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
|**Agricultural land-use change & intensification** (monocultures, field enlargement, grassland conversion, fallow loss) | ***Strong*** – explains ~50 % of variance across >1,700 EU sites; 66 % of biomass variance in NRW 1989–2022 | – Post-WWII intensification meta-analysis attributes ≥60 % of biomass loss to this axis  
– Grassland butterfly index −39 % as permanent grassland shrank −14 %  
– Silage-corn (+37 %) and bioenergy expansion tightly track biomass drops | Fine-grain land-use histories still absent for E & SE Europe; interaction with CAP greening measures unresolved |
|**Synthetic chemical load** (insecticides, fungicides, fertiliser-driven eutrophication) | ***Moderate‐to‐strong*** historically; *declining but still important* | – Neonicotinoids & nitrate deposition implicated in >60 % of decline signal pre-2009; seed-coating ban cut foliar+seed toxic load, yet biomass stayed low  
– EU rivers: 76 % of 474 pesticides re-appear 4–30 d post-peak; 35 % are unclassified chronic toxics | Need for chronic low-dose + mixture toxicity measurement in situ; fungicides under-studied though "intermittent" in rivers |
|**Climate warming & extremes** | ***Strong and rising***, esp. mountains/high latitudes | – >80 % of Swiss turnover explained by temperature  
– Mountain/tropical European enclaves now show pesticide ≈ climate effect size  
– Poleward range expansions of pesticide-tolerant generalists | Attribution hampered by collinearity with land-use; need trait-based mechanistic models |
|**Urbanisation & ALAN** | **Moderate, growing** | – Paired-site data show additive drops in nocturnal Lepidoptera; light dome radius >20 km | City-scale manipulative ALAN experiments scarce; remote-sensing ALAN layers 2013–2023 now enable quasi-experimental designs |
|**Freshwater degradation** (nutrients & pesticides) | **Moderate** | – 15 M water measurements show many insecticides "permanent"; aquatic insect indices stagnate in intensively farmed basins despite EU WFD | Need linkage between high-frequency water chemistry and emerging aquatic insect eDNA datasets |
|**Biological invasions & disease** | **Low–moderate** overall, but high for specific taxa (e.g., Bombus) | – Limited long-term data; overshadowed by other drivers | Expand pathogen screening of archived material with meta-barcoding |
|**Natural succession & forest encroachment** | **Moderate** | – Abandonment in alpine/marginal lands reduces open-habitat specialists; interacts with climate | High-resolution land-cover time-series (e.g., E-LC10) could quantify |

Take-home: **Land-use and climate remain the primary coarse-scale forces**, with **chemical toxic load** still critical but decoupled from the steepest recent biomass collapse in certain regions, challenging the “pesticide-first” narrative. Sub-regional patterns may reverse this hierarchy.

## 4. Integrating Learnings Across Scales

### 4.1 Biomass vs Richness vs Functional & Phylogenetic Diversity (PD)

The Belgian 44-site pan-trap network shows **biomass correlates tightly with abundance (r ≈ 0.97)** but **weakly with species richness or PD (r ≈ 0.5)**. Reliance on biomass alone therefore risks overlooking cryptic functional collapse. However, the same study demonstrates that *traditional Linnaean taxonomy mirrors multi-gene phylogenies (>0.95)*; rapid PD proxies are thus feasible even where genomic resources are sparse.

### 4.2 Turnover and “Pseudo-wins”

Warm-adapted generalists expanding poleward can **inflate apparent richness** while masking loss of cold-adapted specialists (Swiss case). Effective indicators must therefore partition β-diversity.

### 4.3 Temporal Baselines

Fossil data place modern changes in a **millennial context**, confirming that human land-use has been a potent insect filter since the Neolithic. Yet current rates (~75 % biomass in <30 yr) outpace past natural and anthropogenic pulses.

### 4.4 Differential Taxon Responses to Drivers

Across >1,700 EU sites: 
• High-intensity cropland & pasture drive **70–80 % declines in Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera**.  
• **Diptera** often increase – echoing their higher tolerance to agro-chemicals and flexible trophic niches.  
• In *tropical* (Macaronesian, Azorean) croplands, pollinator richness drops 44 % and abundance 49 % relative to primary forest, underscoring climate × intensification interactions.

## 5. Responses to Scoping Questions

### Q1 : Taxonomic scope – target groups or all taxa?

Recommendation:

• **Core focus on three functional guilds**—pollinators (Apidae, Syrphidae, non-bee flower visitors), aquatic insects (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Odonata), and soil arthropods (Coleoptera, Collembola, Formicidae)—allows mechanistic linkage to key ecosystem services (crop production, water purification, nutrient cycling).  
• Include **pan-taxon context** via meta-datasets (Hallmann, Møller) to keep the narrative anchored in overall biomass trends.  
• Rationale: depth > breadth for causal attribution; yet avoiding guild siloing prevents oversight of compensatory dynamics (e.g., Diptera increases).

### Q2 : Quantitative synthesis of relative driver contributions or qualitative overview?

• **Hybrid**. Use existing meta-analytic effect sizes where available (e.g., land-use explains ~50 %, pesticides historically ≥20 %, climate 15–25 % but rising).  
• Where attribution is currently "presumed" (69 % of drivers in long-term datasets), opt for *structured qualitative* assessment (GRADE-like evidence coding) while flagging that new assets—EU 250 m pesticide-use maps, high-frequency pesticide river data, harmonised climate re-analyses—can enable future Bayesian ranking models.

### Q3 : Temporal scope and geographic granularity?

• **Primary window**: post-1950 industrial agriculture epoch for causal clarity (synthetic pesticide era, CAP policy cycles), overlaid with **palaeoecological flashbacks** (10 ka → present) to contextualise magnitude and rate.  
• **Granularity**: EU-27 plus the UK, summarised by **Biogeographic Regions** (Atlantic, Continental, Boreal, Alpine, Mediterranean, Pannonian, Macaronesian) to capture driver heterogeneity. Country-level vignettes desirable for policy relevance where monitoring infrastructure is strong (DEU, GBR, CHE, NLD, BEL).

## 6. Unresolved Questions and Data Opportunities

1. **Pesticide mixtures & chronic exposure**: Intermittent vs permanent signature in rivers (fungicides vs neonics) reveals regulatory blind spots. Connect Water Framework Directive data with aquatic insect trait databases.
2. **ALAN remote sensing**: VIIRS DNB time-series (2013–present) can be coupled with Rothamsted light-trap revival network.
3. **Trait-mediated climate vulnerability**: Merge insect functional traits (bodysize, voltinism) with EURO-CORDEX climate projections for predictive mapping.
4. **Citizen science & eDNA**: Leverage iNaturalist‐derived occurrence explosions and riverine eDNA metabarcoding to close spatial gaps in SE Europe.

---

## 7. Policy and Management Levers

• **Landscape heterogeneity**: Reinstate fallows, hedgerows, and low-intensity grasslands; strengthen Pillar II agri-environment schemes—evidence suggests multifunctional landscapes mitigate 50 – 80 % of abundance declines.  
• **Chemical regulation 2.0**: Shift from single-compound acute toxicity to *mixture and chronic risk* frameworks; include fungicides in long-term monitoring.  
• **Climate adaptation corridors**: Maintain east–west elevational corridors to facilitate specialist range shifts.  
• **Light pollution codes**: Enforce shielded, low-UV spectra in peri-urban municipals; proven 30–60 % reductions in moth disorientation.

## 8. High-Priority Research Actions (Speculative, Flagged *)

*1. Pan-European **Automated Malaise** network* – AI-assisted image recognition + metabarcoding to deliver near-real-time abundance × diversity feeds (pilot cost ≈ €15 M yr⁻¹).

*2. **Causal inference platform** using Bayesian Structural Equation Models combining Copernicus land-use, pesticide granular maps, daily river chemistry, ERA-5 climate and standardised insect data – feasible by 2028 with FAIR data mandates.

*3. **Resurrection ecology**: Apply CRISPR/Clio DNA amplification on decades-old museum specimens to track micro-evolutionary responses to pesticides.

## 9. Key Take-aways

1. **Land-use change** remains the single strongest cross-taxon driver, but **climate warming** is catching up and already dominates community turnover in high-latitude/mountain systems.
2. The **pesticide narrative is evolving**: while historically pivotal, bans/reductions have not reversed biomass losses, implying additive/masked stresses.
3. **Biomass ≠ Biodiversity**; high correlations with abundance hide substantial losses in functional and phylogenetic diversity.
4. **Turnover masquerades as stability**; gains by warm-adapted generalists can obscure specialist losses.
5. New, high-resolution datasets (pesticide maps, river chemistry, ALAN, Copernicus land-use) render previously ‘presumed’ drivers measurable—**the data bottleneck is closing**.
