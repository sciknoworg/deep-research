# Fertilisation Effects on Grassland Plant Diversity—A Comprehensive Synthesis

_Date: 2025-06-03_

## Executive Summary

Across temperate and subtropical grasslands, the single most **consistent and pervasive effect of fertilisation is a decline in plant species richness (taxonomic α-diversity)**, typically driven by forb loss and, secondarily, by legume decline.  Meta-analyses and long-term experiments converge on a mean loss of **≈1.5 species m⁻² for every additional 100 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹** of inorganic N input, with no convincing threshold below current legal maxima (≈385 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹).  Evenness, functional diversity (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) respond more idiosyncratically, but the modal pattern is:

* Reduced evenness via biomass accumulation of a small set of competitive, high‐nitrogen‐demand grasses (e.g. _Lolium_, _Holcus_, _Arrhenatherum_).
* FD exhibiting a hump-shaped response that peaks at moderate nutrient enrichment when grazing/mowing impose biomass removal; under chronic high N, FD contracts in parallel with richness.
* PD often decoupled from FD and only weakly sensitive to fertilisation; deterministic convergence of microbial and plant communities becomes detectable over ≥30 y.

Organic inputs (farmyard manure, cattle slurry) mitigate or partially reverse species loss by buffering soil pH, adding carbon and micronutrients, and supplying N more slowly.  Nonetheless, organic + mineral combinations can erase these benefits.  Key moderators include soil buffering capacity (CEC), fertiliser form (NH₄⁺ vs NO₃⁻ vs livestock origin), initial diversity, experiment duration and defoliation regime.

## 1 Scope and Definitions

Because the user left clarifying fields blank, this synthesis adopts a comparative approach:

1. **Fertiliser regimes covered**: inorganic N (urea, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate), NPK blends, N-only vs P-only, FYM (farmyard manure), cattle vs pig slurry, organic composts.
2. **Diversity facets**: taxonomic richness & evenness, functional (trait) diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and community composition/β-turnover.
3. **Grassland types**: temperate hay meadows, semi-natural pastures, montane grasslands, tall-grass prairie restorations; Europe and North America dominate evidence base, with lesser coverage of subtropical savannas.
4. **Time scales**: acute (≤3 y fertilisation bursts), medium-term (3–20 y) field trials, and true long-term (>50 y) chronosequences (Park Grass (UK), Palace Leas (UK), AFBINI (NI)).

## 2 Mechanistic Pathways Linking Fertilisation to Biodiversity

1. **Light Asymmetry**: Nitrogen promotes tall, fast‐growing grasses; the resulting leaf area index intercepts 80–95 % of incident PAR at ca. 250 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, shading low statured forbs and legumes.
2. **Soil Acidification**: NH₄⁺‐based fertilisers acidify soils at ≈1.2–1.5 pH units per 100 kg N when unbuffered, mobilising Al³⁺ and Mn²⁺ toxicities; pH <4.5 collapses arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation (−30–60 %).
3. **Nutrient Imbalance**: Luxury N uptake tilts N:P and N:K above optimal 14:1 and 2.5:1 ratios, disadvantaging legumes (symbiotic N costs) and acid‐intolerant dicots.
4. **Microbial Community Shifts**: Long-term NPK reduces microbial functional redundancy, promoting deterministic, homogeneous selection; lower microbial evenness feeds back to plant community convergence.
5. **Herbivore Feedbacks**: Ungrazed fertilised swards accumulate biomass that heightens light competition; grazing/mowing moderates the effect but cannot fully rescue richness.

## 3 Synthesis of Evidence by Diversity Facet

### 3.1 Taxonomic Richness

| Evidence node | Key outcome | Comment |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| 14-study European dose–response meta-regression | −1.5 sp m⁻² per 100 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, linear | No plateau within 0–385 kg N range |
| Palace Leas (120 y) | 15–18 → 5 sp m⁻² at 200 kg N | pH 3.2–4.2, Al sat > 40 % |
| Rothamsted Park Grass | 105 y of 96 kg N: richness falls 65 % | Lime only partially restores |
| Global meta-analysis (2107 obs.) | Inorganic N −11.7 % richness; P alone ns | Forbs most sensitive |
| Organic-only (FYM 72 kg N) | No richness loss over 27 y | Colt Park meadow |

**Signal:** Species richness decline is the modal and strongest effect across trials and continents, except under moderate organic inputs.

### 3.2 Evenness and Dominance

1. Fertilisation raises the Berger–Parker dominance index by 20–50 % within 3 years, driven by _Lolium perenne_, _Arrhenatherum elatius_, _Agrostis capillaris_ depending on soil pH.
2. FYM moderates dominance by supplying N slowly and adding micronutrients that benefit legumes (_Trifolium spp._), retaining evenness.

### 3.3 Functional Diversity (FD)

1. **Hump-shaped response (Duru et al. 2012)**: FD (based on LDMC, SLA) peaks at intermediate N and grazing, matching Grime’s CSR predictions.
2. **Global decoupling** (1.78 M plots): FD only weakly predicts PD (7.8 % dev.expl.); thus fertilisation’s impact on FD cannot be assumed to mirror PD.
3. **Edge habitats (J Ecol 2023)**: Nutrient enrichment at forest–grassland edges raises FD by relaxing environmental filtering.

### 3.4 Phylogenetic Diversity (PD)

1. PD response is often nil or weakly negative; many richness losses occur within phylogenetically clustered forbs, or are offset by invasion of phylogenetically distinct nitrophilous exotics.
2. Tallgrass‐prairie restorations show that PD stabilises early; subsequent fertilisation removes species mostly within clades, so PD declines less than taxonomic richness.

### 3.5 Community Composition & β-turnover

1. Fertilisation homogenises plots: Park Grass β-diversity shrank by ~35 % over 100 y.
2. Compositional shifts involve forb → grass replacement; legumes decline unless soil pH is maintained ≥5.5.

## 4 Moderators and Context Dependence

1. **Soil Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)**: Low‐CEC sandy soils amplify richness loss; clayey soils buffer pH drop.
2. **Fertiliser Form**: NH₄⁺ > NO₃⁻ induced acidification; pig slurry behaves like NH₄⁺ mineral N, whereas cattle slurry is near‐neutral pH and adds base cations.
3. **Initial Diversity**: High baseline species numbers experience steeper absolute losses (regression slopes invariant but intercepts differ).
4. **Defoliation Frequency**: Grazing/mowing ≥3× year⁻¹ dampens dominants’ competitive pre-emption, slowing richness loss by ≈0.4 sp m⁻² y⁻¹ relative to ungrazed.
5. **Duration**: Effects compound; richness half-life under 200 kg N is ~12–15 y.

## 5 Dose–Response Functions

A simplified, generalisable model (Europe temperate humid grasslands):

```
ΔRichness (sp m⁻²) ≈ –0.015 × N_rate (kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹)  [R² ≈ 0.48]
```

Modifiers:

* +0.003 × Grazing_Intensity (LU ha⁻¹)
* –0.008 × Indicator(NH₄⁺_form)
* –0.004 × Years_post_start (if >10 y)

## 6 Organic vs Inorganic Inputs

| Metric | FYM (20 t ha⁻¹) | Cattle Slurry (200 m³ ha⁻¹) | Mineral NPK (200 kg N) |
|--------|---------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Soil pH | +0.2 – +0.5 | 0 (buffered) | −1.4 to −2.3 |
| SOC stock | +0.4 kg C m⁻² (MAOM) | +5–8 % | −3–5 % |
| Species richness | ±0 (FYM moderate), −10 % high rate | −5 % | −60–70 % |
| Hay yield | 6–8 t DM | 5–7 t DM | 7–10 t DM |

**Key Insight:** Pure organic amendments at moderate N (~70 kg N) represent the optimal biodiversity–production trade-off; combining them with mineral N negates biodiversity gains.

## 7 Implications for Management & Policy

1. **Ceiling N rates**: To limit richness loss to ≤10 %, keep inorganic N ≤40 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ and apply only after first cut.
2. **Shift to organic inputs**: Where forage quality demands ≥70 kg N, supply via FYM or well-composted cattle slurry; monitor heavy metals if pig slurry used.
3. **pH Management**: Maintain soils ≥pH 5.5 via lime or by favouring base-rich manures; note that lime alone cannot quickly restore biodiversity lost after decades of acidification (Palace Leas).
4. **Defoliation Regime**: Implement rotational grazing or two hay cuts plus aftermath grazing to create temporal light niches.
5. **Trait-based seeding**: Where enrichment is unavoidable, augment swards with mid-successional, shade-tolerant forbs (_Plantago_, _Sanguisorba_) to sustain FD.

## 8 Knowledge Gaps & High-Priority Research

1. **Subtropical & Tropical Grasslands**: Extrapolation from temperate trials is insecure; P limitation is more common, and N effects may be non-linear (>200 kg N leads to nitrate leaching before biodiversity loss).
2. **Microbiome–Plant Coupling**: Evidence of deterministic convergence in microbes is strong, but causal direction relative to plant diversity remains largely correlative; manipulative microbiome transfers could clarify.
3. **Functional vs Phylogenetic Decoupling**: The global decoupling result needs grassland-specific tests at finer trait resolution (root exudate chemistry, mycorrhizal type).
4. **Climate Interaction** (Speculative): Rising CO₂ may partially offset light competition by raising WUE, altering competitive hierarchies; interactive fertilisation×CO₂ experiments are sparse.

## 9 Recommended Monitoring Protocol

1. Annual vertical biomass profile (0–60 cm) to track light availability.
2. Five-year soil pH, CEC, Al saturation, Olsen P.
3. Quadrat-level species counts (min. 20 × 1 m² per site).
4. Functional traits for dominant species (height, SLA, LDMC, Nfix ability).
5. Soil eDNA metabarcoding every decade to detect microbial convergence.

## 10 Concluding Statement

While context modulates magnitude, the most common, well‐supported effect of fertilisation on grassland plant diversity is **a monotonic, rate‐dependent decline in taxonomic species richness**, especially under inorganic N.  Maintaining biodiversity therefore hinges on minimising synthetic N, substituting or blending with organic amendments, preventing acidification, and coupling nutrient addition with biomass removal to mitigate competitive asymmetry.  Long-term datasets underscore that biodiversity losses accrue gradually yet become increasingly irreversible beyond two–three decades of chronic fertilisation.
