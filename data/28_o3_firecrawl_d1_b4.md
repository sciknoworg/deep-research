## 1. Framing and Scope  
Global change (GC) alters plant communities through interacting abiotic drivers—elevated CO₂, warming, altered precipitation regimes, nutrient deposition and land-use change. Herbivory (from invertebrates to megafauna, terrestrial to marine) can (i) buffer, (ii) amplify or (iii) qualitatively redirect these abiotic impacts. This report synthesises **experimental, observational and modelling evidence** across biomes, integrating >25 years of research (including the 12 specific learnings provided) to answer:  

> **To what extent—and by which mechanisms—does herbivory modulate GC effects on plant community structure, function and services?**  

Where possible, we highlight **contrasting outcomes, key moderators, knowledge gaps, and management levers**. Speculative or forward-looking ideas are flagged 🔮.

## 2. Mechanistic Pathways Linking Herbivory and Global Change Drivers  

| GC Driver | Direct Plant Effects | Herbivore–Plant Feedbacks | Net Community Consequence (Conditionally) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Elevated CO₂** | ↓ leaf N (15–17 %), ↑C:N, altered phenolics/terpenes (learning 6, 11) | Compensatory feeding ↑14 %; guild-specific (Homoptera ↑, Lepidoptera ↓). CO₂-induced N–dilution suppressed gastropod grazing **unless** N was added (learning 1). | Can shift dominance toward species tolerant of low N/high C:N and/or heavy sap-feeding. |
| **Warming** | ↑ enzyme kinetics, phenology advance, drought stress; woody encroachment at high latitudes. | Faster insect development, longer seasons; mammals track snow melt (learning 9). Reindeer >5 km⁻² keep shrubs short, creating “browse traps” (learning 4). | Herbivory often **buffers** woody expansion but **amplifies** graminoid increases (learning 5). |
| **Altered Precipitation / Drought** | Water stress filters high-SLA, shallow-rooted taxa. | Drought truncates “green wave,” lowering forage, forcing longer ranging (learning 9); can invert grazing impacts across aridity gradients (learning 8). | Grazing exclusion raises diversity in semi-arid but lowers it in humid grasslands after ≥1 yr (learning 8). |
| **Nitrogen Deposition** | Eutrophication, competitive exclusion of forbs. | Added N (4 g m⁻² yr⁻¹) erased CO₂-related grazing declines and accelerated litter loss (+4.8 %; learning 1). | Herbivores can **rescue light** at ground level, maintaining richness only when ≥10 % PAR is restored (learning 12). |
| **Land-use / Grazing Intensity** | Stocking rate determines energy removal and trampling; promotes shrub encroachment if overgrazed savannas (learning 2). | Mixed grazer–browser assemblages delay tipping, enhance WUE 15–20 % (learning 2). | Management lever with the largest immediate effect size; determines direction of interaction with other drivers. |

## 3. Evidence Across Biomes  

### 3.1 Temperate Grasslands  
* **FACE × N factorials (Cleland 2006; Zuo 2018)** show resources—not CO₂ alone—drive herbivory and decomposition. CO₂ effects depend on N deposition, confirming bottom-up control (learning 1).  
* **Nutrient-Network 40-site exclosures**: Large herbivores maintain diversity by reopening the light niche; when excluded, richness drops up to 30 % if PAR at ground level falls (learning 12).  
* **National Bison Range 40-yr dataset** (learning 5) reveals warming-induced shift from grasshopper-dominated to mammal-dominated herbivory (+700 % microtines), causing grass ANPP +251 %, dicot −65 %, and reduced chemical defences. Herbivore community assembly—not mere presence/absence—drives outcomes.  

### 3.2 Semi-Arid and Drylands  
* **Namibian savanna agent-based models** (learning 2) show that high stocking (≈15 ha LSU⁻¹) combined with SSP585 climate leads to grass→shrub tipping in <10 yr. Lower density, browser-inclusive herds prevent this, increasing plant functional diversity and resilience.  
* **Aridity-controlled grazing meta-analysis** (learning 8) highlights temporal nuances: exclusion initially boosts richness even in humid sites (<6 months) but reverses after ≥1 yr as tall C₃/C₄ grasses monopolise. Management must consider *duration × aridity × stocking* interactions.  

### 3.3 Arctic / Boreal  
* **Paleo-records & long-term reindeer exclosures** (learning 4) demonstrate herbivores can halt or reverse treeline advance, enhance summer albedo and guard soil-C. Megafaunal loss 10 ka triggered shrub regime shift releasing >1 000 Gt C—arguably the largest herbivory-mediated GC feedback on record.  
* **2024 systematic review of tundra herbivore functional diversity** (learning 7): Large + small herbivores act **compensatorily**; only combined pressure maintains low shrubs, raises diversity in graminoid sites, and increases soil temperature via snow compaction.  

### 3.4 Forests and Treeline  
Herbivore pressure often determines whether warming produces forest densification or stable open systems:  
* Browsing cervids can suppress saplings, yet climate-driven nutrient dilution (learning 9) may reduce their body mass, altering future pressure.  
* Fire-climate interactions: frequent burns favour early-seral deciduous stands susceptible to ungulate browsing, creating feedbacks that delay conifer recovery.  

### 3.5 Marine Parallels  
* **Tropical rabbitfish, siganids, parrotfish** extend ranges under warming, removing macroalgae (“isoyake”) and restructuring reefs (learning 10). The **herbivory × temperature** interaction mirrors terrestrial shrub suppression, underscoring cross-realm analogues.

## 4. Trait-Mediated and Chemical Responses  
1. **Carbon–Nutrient Balance**: Elevated CO₂ ↓N, ↑C:N; strongest in C₃, non-fixers (learning 11).  
2. **Secondary Metabolites**: Herbs/forbs ↑ phenolics (+20–60 %); shrubs ↑ terpenes; trees ↓ terpenes—shifting palatability across strata.  
3. **Interactive Effects**: Warming amplifies phenolic boosts; drought modifies allocation to structural C vs defences.  
4. **Herbivore Selectivity** feeds back: higher phenolics deter generalists but may select for detox-capable specialists, potentially increasing guild evenness.  

---

## 5. Dynamics of Herbivore Communities Under Global Change  
• **Guild-specific responses** to CO₂ (learning 6): sap-feeders thrive; miners/chewers decline unless moderated by N or warming.  
• **Functional diversity matters** (learning 7): similar guilds additively increase grazing, but body-size complementarity generates compensatory effects crucial for shrub control.  
• **Community re-assembly** outpaces static fencing experiments (learning 5); ignoring turnover risks misattributing plant changes solely to abiotic drivers.  

🔮 *Speculation*: Assisted migration of predator guilds (e.g., spiders, birds) into warming grasslands could recalibrate trophic balances faster than plant adaptation.  

---

## 6. Synthesis: When Does Herbivory Buffer vs Amplify GC Effects?  

Buffering likely when:  
* Herbivores target the structural winners of GC (e.g., shrubs in tundra, tall grasses under eutrophication).  
* Functional diversity is high—mixed browser + grazer assemblages (learning 2, 7).  
* Resource addition (N, water) promotes unpalatable dominance, yet herbivores re-open light/space niches (learning 12).  

Amplification likely when:  
* GC lowers plant quality (↑C:N), driving compensatory feeding that further stresses plants (learning 6).  
* Herbivore guilds shift toward ones benefitting from GC (sap-feeders with elevated CO₂, mammals with warming; learning 5, 6).  
* Overgrazing or single-guild dominance removes competitive checks, triggering shrub encroachment in drylands (learning 2).

## 7. Modelling and Forecasting Needs  
1. **Explicit Biodiversity Layers**: Integrate range/abundance data, functional & phylogenetic diversity into SDMs and NCP forecasts (learning 3).  
2. **Interaction Networks**: Mechanistic herbivore–plant links (attack rates, preference curves) reduce structural uncertainty relative to black-box correlative models.  
3. **Uncertainty Propagation**: <50 % of post-2016 ES studies include it; Bayesian ensembles and point-process models should be standard.  
4. **Coupled Abiotic–Biotic Scenarios**: CMIP6 climate + socio-economic (SSPs) with alternative herbivore-management pathways (e.g., low vs high stocking).  

---

## 8. Management & Policy Implications  
1. **Adaptive Stocking**: Maintain moderate, mixed grazer–browser densities (≤10 ha LSU⁻¹ in semi-arid systems) to avoid shrub tipping.  
2. **Temporal Grazing Rotations**: Short-duration, low-intensity pulses in humid grasslands maintain diversity (learning 8).  
3. **Rewilding & “Herbivore Porfolios”**: Restore functional-group richness (large + small), especially in high-latitude landscapes to curb woody expansion (learning 4, 7).  
4. **Nutrient Management**: Coupling N-deposition mitigation with targeted herbivory can suppress eutrophication winners and maintain forbs (learning 1, 12).  
5. **Cross-Realm Lessons**: Kelp reef restoration may need predator control and transplanting **within** new thermal envelopes to compensate for mobile herbivory (learning 10).  
6. **Policy Integration**: Embed herbivore scenarios in GBF-aligned 30×30 planning; failure to consider biotic modulators risks over- or under-estimating protection benefits.  

🔮 *Speculative leverage*: Genetically tracking *forage quality indices* via remote sensing (hyperspectral proxies for leaf N/phenolics) could allow real-time adjustments of stocking rates or predator releases.

## 9. Key Knowledge Gaps & Research Priorities  
1. **Herbivore Nutrition Under Multifactor Change**: How do simultaneous CO₂×T×N×drought alter forage digestibility and herbivore fitness?  
2. **Non-linear Thresholds**: Precise stocking/climate combinations at which grass→shrub or kelp→urchin barrens tip remain poorly resolved.  
3. **Long-Term Community Re-Assembly**: Experiments longer than plant and herbivore generation times (~>20 yr) are rare (see learning 5).  
4. **Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Interactions**: Predator mediation of herbivore responses (e.g., wolves–moose–plants) under GC is still speculative.  
5. **Socio-Economic Feedbacks**: How will carbon markets, dietary shifts, and indigenous land rights influence herbivore landscapes?  

---

## 10. Conclusions  
Herbivory **rarely neutral**: it substantially conditions plant community trajectories under global change, with the direction and magnitude governed by *resource context, herbivore functional diversity, and management actions*. Accounting for these biotic modulators is no longer optional—ignoring them risks mis-forecasting biodiversity, carbon, and ecosystem-service outcomes.  

### Actionable Take-Home Messages  
• Monitor and manage herbivore **functional diversity**, not just biomass.  
• Couple nutrient and grazing management; they jointly set community outcomes.  
• Embed herbivory explicitly in climate-biodiversity-service models to inform GBF and NBS targets.  

With targeted research and adaptive practice, herbivory can be steered from a **problem** into a **solution space** for navigating the Anthropocene.
