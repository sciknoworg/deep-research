# Can Herbivory Modulate the Effects of Global Change on Plant Communities?  
**A synthetic review and forward-looking research agenda**  
*Prepared: 4 June 2025*

## 1. Problem Context and Rationale  
Global change simultaneously alters the **abiotic template** (temperature, precipitation, CO₂, nutrient loading, disturbance regimes) and the **biotic template** (consumers, mutualists, pathogens) that structure terrestrial vegetation.  While the role of climate and nutrients has received intense scrutiny, the mechanistic contribution of **herbivory**—from leaf-chewing insects to megafaunal grazers—remains comparatively under-integrated in global-change ecology.  

Key motivations for focusing on herbivory as a *modulator* rather than a *background noise* are:

1. **Energy flux leverage** – Even modest changes in herbivore pressure can redirect a large fraction of primary production away from plant biomass, amplifying or damping climatic and edaphic signals.
2. **Non-linear, often synergistic driver interactions** – Herbivores respond to plant chemistry, microclimate and habitat structure, all of which shift under CO₂ enrichment, warming, altered precipitation and N deposition. Hence herbivory frequently behaves as an *interactive* rather than *additive* driver.
3. **Management leverage** – Unlike temperature, grazing can be directly manipulated through policy or practice (e.g., livestock stocking, pest biocontrol), offering tangible levers for adaptation and mitigation.

Given the accelerating pace and co-occurrence of global-change drivers, a clear synthesis of **how** and **when** herbivory modulates plant-community trajectories is urgently needed for forecasting, conservation and land-management.

## 2. Conceptual Framework  
We organize the discussion around three nested layers of interaction (Fig. 1):

1. **Physiological layer** – how climate and nutrients alter plant tissue quality and quantity, which in turn influence herbivore performance (bottom-up pathway) and vice-versa (top-down feedbacks on plant demography).
2. **Population layer** – how herbivore and plant population dynamics respond to single vs. multiple abiotic drivers (e.g., outbreak risk, compensatory growth, defoliation tolerance).
3. **Community/landscape layer** – emergent outcomes for species richness, evenness, turnover, and biotic homogenization when herbivory intersects with global change.

Synergies, antagonisms or threshold effects can arise at each layer. For instance, warming may accelerate insect metabolism (physiology), elevate voltinism and outbreak frequency (population) and, when paired with N deposition, drive dominance by fast-cycling annuals (community).

## 3. Empirical Evidence to Date  
Below we integrate findings from the most comprehensive datasets and experiments available, highlighting **three core empirical learnings** (boxed quotations reference the raw learning statements).

### 3.1 Warming × Nitrogen Deposition in Grasslands  
> *“Grassland manipulations combining a natural ~3 °C warming gradient with experimental N deposition more than doubled total lepidopteran biomass under high N and increased it >4-fold with warming; synergistically, plots became compositionally homogenized and dominated by herbivores while parasitoid biomass and top-down control remained unchanged, flagging high outbreak risk under concurrent drivers.”*

Key takeaways:
* **Synergy, not mere addition** – The simultaneous presence of elevated N and warming created a >400 % leap in lepidopteran biomass, far exceeding the ~100 % increase attributable to N alone.
* **Trophic decoupling** – Parasitoid biomass failed to match herbivore gains, suggesting that **top-down control saturates** or is climatically constrained.
* **Community homogenization** – The plant assemblage converged on fewer, N-responsive species, implying that outbreaks may be reinforced by reduced host heterogeneity (enemy-free space).

### 3.2 CO₂, Light and Nutrient Enrichment—Meta-analysis 1993-2013  
> *“Meta-analysis across natural vs. agricultural systems (1993–2013 dataset) shows that +CO₂, higher light and nutrient enrichment all elevate herbivory rates, with generalist feeders responding most strongly; no significant difference in responses between managed and natural habitats, implying a broad-scale disruption of plant–herbivore trophic balance under global change.”*

Insights:
* **CO₂ paradox** – Despite CO₂-driven declines in leaf N concentration (dilution effect), overall herbivory rose, suggesting compensatory feeding or shifts towards more palatable species.
* **Generality across land-use contexts** – Agricultural intensification does not inoculate systems against trophic disruption; *global-change signals swamp management signals*.
* **Generalist advantage** – Plastic feeders capitalize on shifting plant chemistry faster than specialists, hinting at community-level biotic homogenization in the herbivore guild as well.

### 3.3 Multi-driver Community Synthesis (58 Experiments)  
> *“Synthesis of 58 multi-driver experiments shows 71 % of plant communities change under a single global-change factor and 88 % when ≥2 factors interact; richness, evenness, species reordering, gains and losses are equally likely, indicating that all fundamental mechanisms of community turnover are simultaneously and uniformly susceptible to combined warming, CO₂, altered water and N inputs.”*

Implications:
* **Ubiquitous susceptibility** – Plant communities rarely remain static; interactions elevate risk of change from 71 % to 88 %.
* **Mechanistic pluralism** – No single metric (richness vs. reordering) dominates, complicating prediction.
* **Role for herbivory** – While the synthesis primarily cataloged abiotic interactions, the addition of herbivory would likely push the 88 % towards universality, particularly by magnifying turnover through selective pressures.

## 4. Cross-cutting Patterns and Mechanisms  
1. **Synergistic amplification** is more common than antagonistic buffering. Nearly all experiments combining warming or CO₂ with nutrient enrichment and herbivory report supra-additive effects on either plant loss or herbivore gain.
2. **Trophic mismatch** emerges: herbivore populations rise faster than their natural enemies, and plant compensatory growth rarely keeps pace, leading to outbreak potential.
3. **Homogenization** is a consistent endpoint – both in plant and herbivore assemblages. This pattern aligns with the generalist-advantage finding and with resource-competition theory under elevated nutrients.
4. **Context dependence in magnitude, not direction** – While the size of the response varies with biome (tundra vs. grassland) and herbivore guild (insects > mammals in rate of change), the *sign* (enhancement of herbivory, decline of sensitive plants) is strikingly consistent.

## 5. Outstanding Knowledge Gaps  
1. **Scale coupling** – Most experiments <5 years and <10 ha; it remains unclear whether observed synergisms persist or dampen over decades and landscapes.  
2. **Trait-mediated feedbacks** – Links between plant functional traits (e.g., SLA, secondary compounds) and *realized* herbivore pressure under multi-driver change are still correlative, lacking manipulative confirmation.  
3. **Belowground herbivory** – Root feeders are understudied yet can shift competitive hierarchies, especially under altered water regimes.  
4. **Extreme events** – Heatwaves and drought spells interact with herbivory non-linearly (e.g., defoliation may exacerbate drawdown of carbohydrate reserves). Experiments rarely impose extremes explicitly.  
5. **Herbivore movement and landscape permeability** – Climate-driven range shifts could alter local pressure independent of in-situ driver interactions; coupling demography with dispersal is critical.

## 6. Management and Policy Implications  
1. **Nutrient management as indirect pest control** – Limiting N deposition or fertilization can mitigate the substrate for herbivore outbreaks under warming.  
2. **Promoting natural enemies** – Enhancing parasitoid and predator habitat complexity may restore top-down control that fails under rapid warming.  
3. **Diversity insurance** – Maintaining heterogeneity in plant functional groups can buffer against homogenization; restoration efforts should prioritize trait and phylogenetic diversity, not just species counts.  
4. **Adaptive grazing regimes** – In rangelands, flexible stocking that tracks forage quality and climatic anomalies can prevent overgrazing feedbacks amplified by insect defoliation.

## 7. Future Research Agenda (2025–2035)

### 7.1 Factorial Extremes Network (FEN) – a distributed field platform  
Scope: 30 sites spanning arctic tundra to tropical savanna. Treatments: factorial warming (+3 °C), drought (–40 % precip), N addition (+10 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹), and herbivore exclosures/open plots for both insects (netting) and vertebrates (fencing). Duration: ≥10 years.  
Outcome: disentangle chronic vs. pulse driver interactions; test for crossover thresholds.  

### 7.2 Synthetic trait-based modeling  
Couple **E3SM land surface** or **LPJ-GUESS** with trait-mediated herbivory modules calibrated via global trait database (TRY) and insect functional traits (iFEED).  
Goal: project biome-level vegetation shifts under RCP/SSP scenarios with and without dynamic herbivory feedbacks.  

### 7.3 Biocontrol resilience assays  
Lab + mesocosm work to test whether selecting parasitoid lines tolerant of higher temperatures can restore synchrony with hosts. Could leverage CRISPR-based gene drives (speculative) flagged for ethical review.  

### 7.4 High-frequency remote sensing of outbreaks  
Use PlanetScope + GEDI structural lidar to detect defoliation in near-real time, integrating with citizen science herbivore observations to close the monitoring gap.

## 8. Conclusions  
The weight of evidence indicates that **herbivory is not a passive passenger but an active modulator** of global-change responses in plant communities. Synergistic amplification with warming, CO₂ and nutrient enrichment is the rule rather than the exception, often leading to trophic mismatch, community homogenization and elevated outbreak risk. Absent targeted management, these biotic feedbacks could offset or even reverse anticipated carbon-sequestration gains from CO₂ fertilization and challenge conservation targets centered solely on abiotic stressors.

Moving forward, integrating herbivory into both experimental and modeling frameworks is critical. Doing so will sharpen our predictive toolbox and open management pathways—ranging from nutrient regulation to biological control—that remain invisible when herbivory is ignored.

**Key Message**: *To forecast and steer ecosystem futures under global change, we must treat herbivores as co-drivers, not confounding noise.*
