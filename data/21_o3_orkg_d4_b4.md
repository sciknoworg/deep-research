# Does Grassland Extensification Reduce Soil Microbial Diversity? — A Consolidated Technical Review (cut-off 2025-06-03)

## 1. Scope and Terminology

**Extensification** is here defined as a shift from high‐input/high‐intensity management toward lower external inputs (mineral N, P, K fertiliser, lime), lower or better-distributed stocking densities, reduced mowing frequency or complete mowing abandonment, and—in some cases—abandonment leading to succession.  The interest is global but the empirical evidence remains sharply biased toward temperate grasslands (Europe, North America, China) with fewer long-term datasets from the tropics and semi-arid systems.

**Soil microbial diversity** is treated in a broad sense: taxonomic richness/evenness in bacteria, archaea and fungi, together with functional‐gene diversity (e.g. amoA, nirS/nirK, nifH, pmoA, mcrA) and higher‐order ratios such as fungal : bacterial (F:B) biomass or phospholipid‐fatty-acid (PLFA) signatures.

## 2. Conceptual Framework

1.   **Resource Manipulation**  (nutrient input, pH, labile C) alters energy and stoichiometric constraints, selecting for copiotrophs under high N and oligotrophs or fungi under low N/high C.
2.   **Physical Disturbance**  (tillage, trampling, mowing, fire) operates as a disturbance filter (AMF evidence) and through compaction/oxygen supply gradients.
3.   **Vegetation Feedbacks**  (botanical composition, diversity) drive rhizodeposition and litter quality, cascading to microbes (grass- vs forb-dominated litter; presence of legumes; clover vs grass).
4.   **Climatic and Edaphic Modifiers**  (water, temperature, texture, MAP) modulate the above.

Within this framework, extensification can increase, decrease or leave unchanged microbial diversity depending on which levers dominate and the starting baseline.

## 3. Evidence Synthesis by Management Lever

### 3.1 Fertiliser N & P Withdrawal

* Across temperate Dutch grasslands, step-up mineral-N from 0→120 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ halved the F:B ratio and doubled nitrate leaching; bacterial DNA/protein synthesis ([³H]thymidine/[¹⁴C]leucine) rose proportionally.  Similar patterns are confirmed by 150-yr **Park Grass** (Rothamsted) where F:B is largely invariant above soil pH 4.5 yet mineral N still suppresses total PLFA biomass and respiration.
* In Dutch organic systems, F:B fell from ≈1.3 (0–40 kg N) to <0.6 at >80–120 kg N regardless of manure type, mirroring nitrate losses.
* Inner-Mongolian 13-yr enrichment (120–240 kg N) acidified pH 7.1→4.2, suppressed CH₄ oxidation and boosted N₂O; structural‐equation modelling (SEM) identified NH₄⁺ as the direct N₂O driver, pH/NO₃⁻ for CH₄.
* UK/Ireland long-term withdrawal (≥10 yr) consistently increases total microbial biomass and shifts toward fungi; however 6-yr cessation in northern England failed to raise F:B, showing that residual fertility can lock communities for >6 yr.
* Chinese Mollisol and wheat–maize trials: manure + PK or straw + ≤450 kg N rebuilt total PLFAs and fungal richness, whereas 100 % straw + high N selected for pathogenic fungi and heavy‐metal-tolerant Proteobacteria.
* Swedish/British liming studies link pH>4.5 to stable F:B; below this threshold fungal biomass collapses despite low N, highlighting pH over N as master variable.

**Synthesis:**  Extensification via mineral-N withdrawal generally raises fungal dominance and functional diversity once residual N pools deplete and pH is kept ≥4.5; diversity gains may lag by >6 yr on high-legacy sites.

### 3.2 Grazing Intensity & Livestock Identity

#### 3.2.1 Stocking Rate Gradients

* Global mixed-model meta-analysis of 287 studies: heavy grazing (>~1 AU ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) increases bulk density (+11.3 %), penetration resistance (+52.5 %), and cuts SOC (–10.8 %) and microbial biomass C (–27.9 %).
* Sheep stocking gradient (0, 1.5, 6, 9 ha⁻¹): moderate (1.5–6) enriches **Nitrospirae** nitrifiers, heavy (9) shifts to **Nitrosococcus watsonii** and reduces NH₄⁺; the Nitrospira→Nitrosococcus turnover is driven by compaction and nutrient depletion.  Redundancy analysis confirms bulk density and NH₄⁺-N as principal axes.
* Tibetan Plateau meta-analysis (55 studies): SOC loss scales –10 % (light) to –20 % (heavy); yak more damaging than sheep; BD rises +11.5 %.  Moderate warm-season sheep grazing is recommended as threshold avoiding >12 % SOC loss.
* Czech overwintering sites: archaeal–bacterial alpha diversity declines inside 3 yr and homogenises after 17 yr; faecal methanogens expand leading to hydrogenotrophic CH₄ production.
* Alberta mixed prairie: heavy/early-season cattle reduces litter mass, accelerates decomposition and net C loss.
* Swiss Andosol: intensive, N-fertilised grazing (6 cm sward) sequestered more CO₂ than extensive no-N, but once CH₄+N₂O were included the extensive system was the stronger sink (–31 vs –10 g CO₂-C eq m⁻² yr⁻¹), showing greenhouse trade-offs.
* Brazilian ICLS: canopy height 20 cm produced highest microbial biomass C, lowest qCO₂; intensification to 10 cm decreased MBC in following soybean phase.
* French transect (Norway–France–Italy): pH overrides pasture vs meadow in bacterial composition; management signal disappears after correcting for pH and SOC.

#### 3.2.2 Livestock Species & Mixed Systems

* Livestock identity can exceed intensity effects: Hungarian steppes—sheep grazing lowers forb diversity versus cattle; mixed cattle–sheep systems increase live-weight gain and may buffer biodiversity losses.
* Yak vs Tibetan sheep: Yak extract deeper roots and generate heavier compaction, leading to stronger SOC decline.
* Global stocking-rate meta-analysis confirms declines in plant species richness are largest when moving from moderate to heavy stocking, indirectly feeding back to microbial diversity via vegetation.

**Synthesis:**  Extensification by lowering stocking density from heavy to moderate/light typically increases microbial alpha diversity (esp. fungi, Nitrospira) and functional gene richness, provided compaction is relieved.  Complete grazing exclusion in some hydrologies (South America lowland) can *decrease* mineral‐associated organic matter (MAOM) and hence microbial habitat volume.

### 3.3 Mowing Regime

* 13-yr Lusignan (France): continuous cattle vs mowing — grazing increases SOC and total N and microbial biomass; mowing raises enzyme activity per biomass.
* New Zealand & Finland: twice-annual mowing with biomass removal elevates forb richness, soil respiration and AMF; burning/turf inoculation negligible.
* Sub-alpine French meadows: annual mowing reduces endophytic **Neotyphodium** in Festuca but boosts AM spore density 15× and root colonisation of test crops 2–3×.
* North-Wales fen: single mowing lifted water table, pH, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, but DOC/DIN pulses were short-lived.
* SW Poland Molinion meadows: 10-yr abandonment (no mowing) lowered soil OM, N, K, Ca, Mg; floristic variance explained 4× more by soil parameters than mowing status.
* Northern England upland meadows: Zero mineral fertiliser + mid-July hay cut + autumn grazing + legume seeding (MG3b target) produced persistent increases in fungal∶bacterial ratios over 14 yr.
* Italian hay meadow near Fucecchio: 3-yr mowing cessation raised SOC & N and pH, but risked out-competition of habitat specialists.

**Synthesis:**  Switching from frequent/intensive mowing to reduced frequency or strategic mowing (once-annual July hay) usually increases AMF diversity and soil fungal dominance while retaining plant diversity.  Full abandonment may erode both plant specialists and microbial biomass depending on soil texture and hydrology.

### 3.4 Organic Amendments & Biochar

* Green-waste compost top-dressing (75–100 t ha⁻¹) raises enzyme activities 6–56 % and respiration 94 %; shifts communities toward fungal richness.
* Biochar alone leaves microbiome statistically unchanged; poultry-litter biochar acts as mild lime, increases bacterial:Fungal ratio & net N mineralisation; pine-wood biochar immobilises N and suppresses AMF.
* Straw return: 50 % straw + ≤450 kg N rebuilds total PLFAs; 100 % straw + >450 kg N selects pathogenic fungi.
* Glomus mosseae / Rhizophagus irregularis inoculation raises glomalin, water-stable aggregates, MWD, confirming AMF selection lever.

### 3.5 pH Management (Liming)

* Park Grass 129 yr: liming raised SOC 2–20× and lowered global warming potential despite higher respiration.
* Tropical no-till Oxisol: liming raised CO₂ efflux by 24–47 %, tied to base saturation and pH.
* Surface liming on 60-yr pasture increased labile Pᵢ 42 %, cut phosphomonoesterases, and raised microbial biomass P.
* Swiss acid grassland: liming alone +0.68 t DM ha⁻¹ herbage, +2.37 t after reseeding; increased species richness.
* Brazilian ICLS pH × grazing interaction confirms moderate grazing can maintain higher pH post-lime.

### 3.6 Climate & Hydrological Controls

* Severe summer drought in Swiss experiment increased CH₄ oxidation by ≈50 %; moisture, not N load, dominated methanotrophs.
* Inner-Mongolian chronosequences: MAP is principal driver of high‐affinity methanotroph assembly; greater stochasticity/diversity corresponds to lower CH₄ oxidation potential.
* Qinghai–Tibetan survey: Upland Soil Cluster γ dominates pmoA reads; MAP <500 mm plus pH explain >40 % of variance.
* Zoige incubations: methanogenesis shifts from aceticlastic (**Methanosarcinaceae**) at 4–15 °C to hydrogenotrophic families at 25–35 °C; mcrA copies rise.

**Synthesis:**  Extensification benefits can be neutralised or amplified by moisture and temperature; e.g. better CH₄ sink under drought but risk of reduced N retention in warm, limed Oxisols.

## 4. Integrated Answer to the Initial Question

**Does extensification *reduce* soil microbial diversity?**  The weight of evidence says *generally no*; in most cases it either **increases** diversity (fungal richness, AMF propagules, functional genes) or leaves total taxonomic richness unchanged while re-balancing functional guilds toward slower, fungal-dominated nutrient cycling and greater structural heterogeneity.  However, three clear caveats emerge:

1.  **Residual Fertility & pH Lag:**  Where historic N inputs remain high or pH < 4.5, withdrawal alone does not restore diversity inside typical 5–7 yr project windows.
2.  **Hydrology and Texture:**  Grazing or mowing cessation on shallow or poorly drained soils can reduce MAOM stocks and microbial habitat.
3.  **Extreme Abandonment:**  Long-term abandonment (>10 yr) without biomass removal risks litter accumulation, lower OM quality, and in some systems lower microbial biomass and plant diversity.

## 5. Management Recommendations Beyond the Obvious

1.   **Stage-wise Extensification:**  Step-down mineral N by ≤40 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ increments while simultaneously applying high C:N compost or straw at C:N ≥ 25:1 to buffer yield loss and accelerate microbial reassembly.
2.   **pH First:**  Adjust pH to 5–7 via surface liming *before* N withdrawal; prevents falling below the 4.5 fungal collapse threshold and improves P bioavailability.
3.   **Moderate, Mixed Grazing:**  Retain light–moderate grazing (≈2–3 sheep ha⁻¹ or equivalent), ideally mixed cattle–sheep, to avoid litter saturation and maintain Nitrospira dominance; adjust to soil texture (lighter soils need lower BD).
4.   **Targeted Mowing Windows:**  One late‐summer hay cut with biomass removal, plus autumn/winter grazing, maximises AMF and plant diversity while recycling nutrients via livestock.
5.   **Selective AMF Inoculation:**  When reseeding, include high-glomalin AMF isolates (Glomus mosseae, Rhizophagus irregularis) to jump-start aggregation and SOC protection; screen isolates for >70 % root length colonisation and GRSP yield.
6.   **Compost over Biochar for Rapid Shifts:**  Use 5 cm compost top-dressing to boost enzyme activity and fungal richness; reserve biochar for pH buffering or N immobilisation goals.
7.   **Monitor F:B and Functional Genes, not just Richness:**  Rapid proxies (PLFA F:B, qPCR of amoA, nirS/nirK, pmoA) detect functional turnover sooner than alpha-diversity metrics.
8.   **Climate Tailoring:**  In drylands (<500 mm MAP) keep some grazing to retain CH₄ sink capacity; in humid zones consider short episodic grazing breaks to reduce compaction.

## 6. Key Knowledge Gaps & Speculative Ideas (Flagged)

*   **Speculative:**  Harnessing *comammox* **Nitrospira** via moisture management could stabilise N cycling under moderate fertiliser regimes—field trials lacking.
*   **Data Gap:**  Tropics and semi-arid Africa/S. America under extensification remain under-studied; the hydrology × abandonment interaction is poorly constrained.
*   **Emerging Tool:**  Portable long-read Nanopore sequencing plus machine‐learning derived pmoA/mcrA ratios could give near-real-time CH₄ sink diagnoses.
*   **Contrarian Hypothesis:**  Controlled lime micro-dosing combined with episodic high-density (“mob”) grazing might accelerate MAOM formation faster than total grazing exclusion—needs testing.

## 7. Conclusion

Extensifying grassland management *usually* shifts microbial communities toward greater functional and, in many cases, taxonomic diversity—particularly increasing fungi, AMF, and high-affinity methanotroph heterogeneity—provided pH is buffered above ≈4.5 and some level of disturbance (light grazing or annual mowing) is preserved.  Legacy inputs, hydrology and livestock identity mediate exceptions.  A combination of staged N reduction, strategic liming, mixed moderate grazing and targeted organic amendments offers the most reliable path to enhance microbial diversity without sacrificing soil-carbon gains or agronomic performance.
