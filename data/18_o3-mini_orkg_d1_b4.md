# Final Report: Using Herbarium Specimens to Study the Effects of Climate Change

## Abstract

Herbaria, as repositories of plant specimens collected over centuries, offer an unparalleled archive for studying the ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change. Recent advancements in digitization, molecular techniques, and remote sensing have significantly expanded the utility of these collections. This report synthesizes current research and methodologies integrating herbarium specimens with climate data to interpret phenological, morphological, and distributional shifts in plants. We discuss challenges and opportunities linked with georeferencing, temporal gaps, and data integration from disparate sources, providing a comprehensive guide for leveraging herbaria to generate integrated insights on the effects of climate change.

## 1. Introduction

Herbaria have traditionally served as vital sources for taxonomic studies and biodiversity assessments. However, recent technological advances—especially in image analysis, DNA sequencing, and remote sensing—have opened avenues for using herbarium specimens to trace plant responses to climate change. This report builds on a series of research learnings to address the multifaceted role herbaria can play, including the study of phenological changes (e.g., flowering times), morphological shifts (e.g., alterations in leaf or petiole lengths), and changes in species distributions both at localized and global scales. We also underscore the potential to integrate these archival records with contemporary climate datasets and remote sensing records.

## 2. Advances in Digitization and Molecular Techniques

### 2.1 Digitization of Herbarium Specimens

The digitization of herbarium collections has transformed raw specimens into accessible digital records, which allow researchers to extract detailed morphological and phenological information with high precision. Initiatives like digital repositories from the Consortium for California Herbaria have provided expansive datasets that capture the spatial and temporal dimensions of plant characteristics.

### 2.2 Molecular Techniques and Image Analysis

Recent progress in DNA sequencing has unlocked new research avenues by linking genetic adaptations to climate-induced selective pressures. Coupling this with high-resolution image analysis—for example, using ImageJ plugins to calculate Phenological Indices—enables more accurate quantification of phenological changes. This integrated approach has significantly improved the fit of pheno-climatic models, as evidenced by studies on species like Streptanthus tortuosus. The combination of molecular data with morphological measurements offers a more comprehensive view of plant adaptations over time.

## 3. Multidimensional Datasets from Herbaria

Herbaria specimens provide a multidimensional dataset beyond occurrence records. They encapsulate a wealth of information such as:

- **Nutrient Profiles and Defensive Compounds:** Analyses of nutritional content and secondary metabolites indicate physiological responses to environmental stresses.
- **Historical Herbivory Patterns and Disease Lesions:** Records of herbivore damage or disease signs provide insights into historical biotic interactions and stress responses.
- **Morphological Metrics:** Quantitative measurements of plant organs, as seen in studies on Plantago lanceolata L., reveal trends such as increases in leaf blade and petiole lengths, with significant proportions of these changes attributable to climate shifts.

While herbarium specimens have been underused in studying drivers such as pollution, habitat conversion, and overexploitation, they remain invaluable for assessing responses to broader climatic shifts.

## 4. Integrative Approaches: Combining Herbaria with Climate and Remote Sensing Data

### 4.1 Integrative Study Designs

Modern studies increasingly blend herbarium records with contemporary datasets, including climate models and remote sensing records (

- **Spatial and Temporal Bridging:** Integrating historical herbarium data with modern remote sensing databases, such as MODIS or GIMMS NDVI, overcomes the temporal gaps inherent in individual datasets.
- **Calibration Across Scales:** Statistical techniques (e.g., ANCOVA, regression models) are employed to reconcile discrepancies between the herbarium’s localized data and broader remote sensing records that capture large-scale vegetation trends. This is critical because simulation studies have shown that geographic uncertainties (e.g., spatial displacements of 2–25 km) can significantly alter sensitivity estimates for plant responses.

### 4.2 Remote Sensing Techniques

Remote sensing methodologies like BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend), STARFM (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model), and polynomial trend analysis have been applied effectively to detect non-linear trends in vegetation indices. These techniques provide robust tools to track seasonality and discern climate-induced changes in vegetation. When coupled with herbarium data, these analyses offer a multi-layered perspective that integrates historical plant records with modern environmental monitoring.

### 4.3 Overcoming Data Discrepancies

One major challenge in integrative studies is harmonizing datasets spanning different temporal and spatial resolutions. Issues such as georeferencing noise and interpolation errors must be addressed. Researchers have proposed several strategies, including:

- **Enhanced Georeferencing Algorithms:** Tailoring algorithms to refine specimen locality estimates to account for inherent uncertainties.
- **Temporal Calibration Methods:** Applying statistical corrections to account for the lag between historical records and current climate measurements.
- **Multivariate Statistical Techniques:** Leveraging regression and ANCOVA to isolate climate variables from confounding factors, thereby refining sensitivity models of phenological responses.

## 5. Case Studies and Empirical Observations

### 5.1 Phenological Shifts and Image Analysis

Studies using digital image analysis provide compelling evidence of shifts in flowering times and other phenological markers in response to climatic variations. The incorporation of climate records into phenological models, for example, has revealed that controlling for phenological variation via image-based indices dramatically improves model reliability.

### 5.2 Morphological Changes Over a Century

A notable study on Plantago lanceolata L. using specimens from the KW-herbarium (spanning 1905–2019) detailed significant morphological changes: an increase of 3.0 cm in leaf blade length, 2.1 cm in petiole length, and 0.6 cm in spike length. Importantly, approximately 34% of these measurable shifts were directly attributed to climate change, underscoring the capacity of herbaria to reveal long-term evolutionary and ecological trends.

### 5.3 Beyond Vascular Plants

Herbaria also house fungal specimens, offering an untapped resource compared to vascular plants. While these specimens are less commonly utilized, their potential for contributing to climate change studies is significant. Expanding our research scope to include fungal populations could yield novel insights into ecosystem dynamics and pathogen responses under changing climatic conditions.

## 6. Challenges and Limitations

Despite clear advantages, several challenges must be addressed to maximize the efficacy of using herbarium records:

1. **Georeferencing Uncertainties:** The spatial accuracy of specimen records is variable, often requiring corrections to confidently use location data in climate models. Simulated perturbations have highlighted how even minimal spatial displacement can weaken sensitivity estimates.

2. **Temporal Gaps and Sampling Bias:** Herbarium records may contain temporal gaps or biases based on collection practices, necessitating careful calibration when integrating with regularly sampled climate datasets.

3. **Integration with Remote Sensing:** Disparities in scale (both spatial and temporal) challenge the direct integration of herbarium data with remote sensing products. Novel statistical and computational frameworks must be developed to bridge these differences.

4. **Underutilization of Non-vascular Data:** The limited use of fungal and non-vascular plant specimens in climate studies remains an untapped research opportunity that could enrich our understanding of ecosystem-wide responses to climate change.

## 7. Future Directions and Recommendations

### 7.1 Multi-disciplinary Integration

A comprehensive approach to studying climate change effects calls for collaboration across disciplines—integrating herbarium data with genomics, remote sensing, and climate science. Researchers should target:

- **High-resolution digital integration:** Merging molecular data with high-definition imaging and remote sensing datasets to build spatio-temporally refined models of plant response.
- **Advanced statistical methods:** Continued development of robust statistical methods that can disentangle the confounding factors of collection bias and georeferencing error in historical data.

### 7.2 Leveraging Novel Technologies

Advancements such as machine learning and AI-driven image analysis offer promising solutions for automating the extraction of phenological and morphological data from vast herbarium collections. Future studies could further incorporate:

- **Deep learning networks:** To process and classify intricate phenological stages from digital images, facilitating large-data analysis.
- **Data fusion techniques:** To harmonize disparate datasets and reduce uncertainties related to spatial and temporal mismatches.

### 7.3 Broader Ecological Implications

Beyond phenological and morphological assessments, herbaria encapsulate indirect indicators of climate change, including records of land-use changes, pollution levels, and invasive species dynamics. A multi-indicator approach not only enriches our understanding of botanical responses but also provides a more holistic picture of ecosystem health and resilience.

### 7.4 Expanding Taxonomic Scope

Encouraging the use of underexplored groups, such as fungi, will diversify our understanding of climate impacts across different ecological niches. Coupling data from vascular and non-vascular organisms could lead to a more integrated ecosystem-level approach in climate change research.

## 8. Conclusions

Herbaria specimens are a promising resource for understanding the multifaceted impacts of climate change on plant species. Through the integration of advanced digitization, molecular techniques, and remote sensing, researchers can now address historical and contemporary challenges that were previously unapproachable. By overcoming challenges related to spatial uncertainties, sampling biases, and dataset integration, herbaria provide a robust foundation for studying phenological, morphological, and distributional changes in plants. Continued innovation in data integration—partnered with emerging technologies—will further enhance the precision and scope of ecological and evolutionary studies in the context of climate change.

The future of climate change research lies in leveraging these ancient archives with modern technology, enabling a dynamic, multi-dimensional approach to understanding the environment. This integrative strategy will not only improve predictive models but also help develop resilient conservation plans in the face of ongoing global change.
