# Final Report: When Could Mowing Be More Efficient than Grazing in Restoring Plant Diversity, and Why?

This report summarizes decades of interdisciplinary research on grassland management under different disturbance regimes, consolidating findings from long-term experiments, modeling efforts, and socio-economic studies. The focus is on the conditions under which mowing—both machine and manual—can be more efficient at restoring or maintaining plant diversity relative to grazing. We review ecosystem-specific factors, management intensity, and economic and biogeochemical impacts, drawing on over 60 distinct learning points from global studies.

## 1. Introduction

Restoration of plant diversity in grassland ecosystems is a multi-faceted challenge driven by the interplay between aboveground and belowground biomass, soil processes, and disturbance regimes. Both mowing and grazing are common management practices, each with distinct mechanisms influencing diversity outcomes. Mowing functions primarily as a seasonal biomass removal method that minimizes soil compaction and avoids selective herbivory, whereas grazing introduces complexities related to selective defoliation, trampling effects, and manure deposition.

This analysis examines scenarios where mowing may be preferred over grazing to achieve restoration of plant diversity. We further discuss the ecological, physiological, and economic factors that modulate management outcomes across various ecosystems—ranging from semi-arid grasslands and temperate meadows to Mediterranean and alpine systems.

## 2. Conceptual Framework and Underlying Mechanisms

### 2.1 Ecosystem Dynamics and Biomass Coupling

Research consistently shows that optimal ecosystem resilience is achieved at intermediate coupling between aboveground and belowground biomass. Although maximal productivity is associated with strong coupling, moderate coupling has been linked to enhanced resilience against disturbances such as heavy grazing, fire, and mowing. In scenarios where correct coupling is absent, mowing often avoids exacerbating negative belowground effects seen in grazing, such as soil compaction and nutrient imbalances.

### 2.2 Physical Disturbance Impacts: Mowing versus Grazing

- **Mowing:** Although long-term machine mowing (e.g., in sandy–organic soils) can induce soil compaction, properly timed mowing—especially at moderate frequencies—tends to preserve soil structure and sustain good management indicators. Mowing, by standardizing biomass removal, minimizes selective pressure on plant species which may be exaggerated under grazing. Studies indicate that early-season hand and machine mowing can markedly increase species richness at the microscale through enhanced stochastic allocation of biomass and modified microclimatic conditions (e.g., improved soil moisture and temperature profiles).

- **Grazing:** Grazing introduces several variables such as selective feeding, trampling, dung deposition, and uneven intensity spatially. Adaptive multi-paddock grazing regimes have demonstrated potential benefits for soil carbon storage and water-holding capacity. However, grazing often increases soil compaction, fosters invasive species (e.g., Salsola tragus, Bromus tectorum), and can lead to excess nitrogen accumulation, particularly at lower intensities without sufficient recovery time. These changes may inadvertently reduce long-term plant diversity in some contexts.

### 2.3 Socio-Economic and Biogeochemical Considerations

Economic analyses underscore a critical trade-off between land use productivity gains and ecosystem service losses. Intensified grazing practices yield high monetary returns. Nonetheless, the exponential relationship between farming intensification and biodiversity loss makes mowing a potentially more sustainable choice when conservation of ecosystem services (including nutrient cycling and soil organic matter accumulation) is prioritized over rapid production.

## 3. Empirical Evidence Comparing Mowing and Grazing

### 3.1 Long-Term Field Experiments and Meta-Analyses

Multiple studies have shown that mowing can often maintain or enhance conservation value more reliably than low-intensity grazing. For instance, long-term studies in southern Sweden indicate that annual mowing leads to higher coverage of native indicator species and lower signs of nitrogen excess compared to areas managed by low-intensity grazing. Similarly, meta-analyses have found that while grazing can enhance biodiversity under certain conditions, mowing frequently produces higher species evenness and diversity by limiting nutrient inputs that favor dominant species.

Further, comparative studies in Eurasian steppe grasslands involving 317 sites have revealed that a proper mowing regime preserves the positive biogeochemical correlation between aboveground and belowground functions—something that is often disrupted by grazing, especially in systems sensitive to nutrient perturbations.

### 3.2 Mechanistic Insights from Experimental Manipulations

- **Soil Compaction and Belowground Traits:** In experiments comparing hand mowing and machine mowing over 38 years, mowing on organic soils resulted in shifts toward superficially rooting species, highlighting some negative physical impacts. However, these impacts can be mitigated with appropriate frequency. In contrast, grazing has been shown to reduce soil aggregate stability and soil moisture, factors that are critical for plant establishment and root development.

- **Species-Specific Functional Traits:** Grazing in Tibetan alpine meadows has been linked to increases in traits associated with fast-growth strategies (e.g., higher specific leaf area), often at the expense of soil carbon storage. Mowing avoids such selective pressures, allowing a broader array of species to establish and persist, which is crucial for functional diversity.

- **Combined Practices and Adaptive Management:** Some studies suggest that mixed grazing–mowing regimes might optimize outcomes by harnessing the benefits of both approaches. However, separate and well-managed mowing, without the confounding impacts of selective grazing, has been demonstrated to maintain or even enhance species diversity, particularly in systems where nutrient cycling integrity is delicate.

### 3.3 Spatial Heterogeneity and Event-Driven Responses

Recent modeling efforts incorporating spatial heterogeneity and event-driven dynamics have shown that mechanical disturbances—such as mowing—are less likely to induce abrupt transitions in vegetation states compared to continuous grazing regimes. These models argue for spatially explicit interventions (for example, temporary small-scale exclosures) to stabilize ecosystems. Mowing, by being spatially uniform, often bypasses early threshold effects that could lead to rapid declines in diversity when the system is already under stress from grazing.

## 4. Ecosystem Specific Considerations

### 4.1 Semi-Arid Grasslands and Steppe Ecosystems

In semiarid regions, grazing has been linked with increased levels of surface soil organic matter (SOM), but at the cost of soil compaction and increased invasive species. Here, mowing offers a more controlled disturbance that can foster rapid species establishment without the deleterious effects on soil structure. Studies from the Inner Mongolian steppe and Eurasian semi-natural grasslands underline mowing’s superiority in maintaining the natural mosaic of plant species across patches.

### 4.2 Temperate and Alpine Grasslands

Temperate systems such as southern Sweden and alpine systems in Norway show that mowing—especially when timed with the early growing season—enhances indicator species and maintains soil structure and nutrient cycling. While adaptive grazing still provides benefits (e.g., increased soil carbon under rotational schemes), the risk of nitrogen build-up and soil compaction remains higher under even low to moderate grazing intensities in fragile alpine soils.

### 4.3 Mediterranean and Other Biodiverse Systems

In Mediterranean research sites (e.g., Spain, Italy, Greece), mowing has proven effective at reducing litter accumulation and promoting species that are typically suppressed by nutrient-dense conditions induced by selective grazing. In such systems, mowing helps maintain the balance between species that require disturbance for germination and those that are adversely affected by high nutrient levels.

## 5. Integrating Economic and Policy Dimensions

Economic models indicate that while intensified grazing leads to higher immediate financial returns, these gains often come at the expense of long-term ecological sustainability. Mowing, although less variable in short-term production benefits, secures ecosystem services such as soil carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, and long-term biodiversity. Policy frameworks that incorporate ecosystem service valuations (e.g., internalizing biodiversity externalities with land taxes or targeted subsidies) increasingly favor management practices that align economic incentives with conservation goals.

Adaptive management frameworks that integrate economic data, real-time ecological monitoring (via remote sensing technologies such as Landsat NDVI, airborne LiDAR, and UAV imaging), and bio-economic modeling (like the GRASP or MPMAS-LUCIA-LIVSIM frameworks) are recommended to tailor interventions to specific ecosystems. This integrated approach helps optimize management strategies not just for productivity, but also for the restoration and maintenance of plant diversity.

## 6. Synthesis and Recommendations

### 6.1 When is Mowing More Efficient? 

The evidence indicates that mowing can be more efficient than grazing in restoring plant diversity under the following conditions:

1. **Nutrient-Sensitive Ecosystems:** Where increased nitrogen input from grazing leads to dominance by a few fast-growing plants, mowing maintains balanced nutrient cycling and prevents conditions that favor invasive species or lower endemism.

2. **Soil Structure Sensitivity:** In systems where soil compaction can significantly affect plant establishment (e.g., sandy-organic soils or alpine meadows), the controlled disturbance from mowing preserves soil aeration and structure more effectively.

3. **Uniform Disturbance Regimes:** When spatial heterogeneity and event-driven dynamics are critical for ecosystem stability—as evidenced by models showing threshold effects—mowing’s uniform application minimizes patchiness that can result in abrupt shifts toward alternative stable states.

4. **Long-term Ecosystem Sustainability:** For managers prioritizing sustained ecosystem multifunctionality and ecosystem service preservation (e.g., soil carbon, nutrient cycling, and biodiversity), mowing typically outperforms grazing by reducing the risk of measured cumulative damage such as soil degradation.

5. **Economic Trade-offs:** In cases where economic models forecast that intensified grazing will lead to exponential monetary gains at the expense of biodiversity, mowing presents a strategy to balance financial returns with the conservation of ecological capital.

### 6.2 Strategic Recommendations for Management

- **Tailor Intervention Frequency:** Site-specific evaluations, such as reducing mowing frequency to align with local productivity, are essential. The optimal frequency varies by ecosystem productivity and sensitivity to nutrient inputs.

- **Combine with Adaptive Management:** Mowing should be integrated with spatially explicit interventions and temporal adaptive frameworks to mitigate threshold risks. For example, experimental approaches combining mowing with temporary exclosures can optimize recovery and long-term diversity.

- **Leverage Remote Sensing and Advanced Monitoring:** Adoption of IoT-enabled field sensors, UAV imaging, and integrated bio-economic models can refine monitoring of species composition, soil moisture, and nutrient cycling dynamics to inform mowing schedules and intensities.

- **Economic Policy Instruments:** Aligning land use policies with ecosystem service valuations (such as through differentiated subsidy schemes and land taxes that internalize biodiversity externalities) can reinforce mowing as a restoration practice with long-run sustainability benefits.

- **Research Gaps:** More targeted studies in non-grassland transitional areas (shrublands, forest edges) are needed to evaluate mowing’s efficiency relative to grazing under different canopy and biodiversity structures.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Mowing emerges as a more efficient tool than grazing in restoring plant diversity, particularly when the management goals emphasize long-term ecosystem sustainability, control of nutrient excess, and soil structure preservation. It is best suited to ecosystems where grazing may lead to selective pressures detrimental to species richness by promoting invasive species and inducing soil compaction. Coupled with modern, adaptive management frameworks and policy instruments that account for both ecological and economic dimensions, mowing provides a compelling strategy for sustainable restoration in a range of ecological settings.

---

This comprehensive review integrates extensive field experiment data, multi-scale modeling results, and economic analyses, providing a nuanced roadmap for practitioners and policymakers aiming to balance ecosystem restoration with productive land use. Future research should continue to explore spatial and temporal heterogeneities and refine mixed management practices to achieve multifunctional landscapes.
