_Date: 2025-06-02_ 

This report synthesizes extensive research findings and emerging methodologies concerning the mechanisms that drive the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship in non-grassland ecosystems. In addition to addressing classic drivers such as species richness and diversity, this review integrates multi-scale experimental data, hybrid modeling approaches, and novel computational frameworks that account for non-linear dynamics across aboveground and belowground interactions. The scope covers diverse systems including forests, wetlands, deserts, and marine environments.

## 1. Introduction

The BEF relationship has historically been studied more intensively in grasslands, yet an increasing body of work is expanding our understanding to other ecosystems. Non-grassland environments present unique spatial, temporal, and trophic complexities that necessitate an integrated approach combining field experiments, imaging techniques, hybrid ecosystem models, and computational simulations. This report details mechanisms including species complementarity, facilitation, resource partitioning, and context-dependent trophic interactions that underpin ecosystem productivity, nutrient cycling, resilience to disturbances, and other ecosystem functions.

## 2. Advancements in Hybrid Ecosystem Modeling

### 2.1 Integrating Process-Based and Organism-Oriented Approaches

Recent developments in hybrid ecosystem models have underscored the need to capture nonlinear interactions occurring aboveground and belowground. The integration of process-based methods with organism-oriented mechanistic representations facilitates:

- **Nonlinear Dynamics:** Capturing rapid responses under global change, where traditional linear models fall short, particularly as factors such as precipitation variability and temperature gradients alter function.

- **Scaling:** Extensions of the plant functional type model now include regional to global scales, providing critical insights into context-dependent responses. 

- **Aboveground–Belowground Linkages:** Hybrid models have been instrumental in representing intertwined processes like nutrient uptake, microbial interactions, and resource allocation. 

*Key Insight:* The need for context-dependent representations has been well established by studies (circa 2004) emphasizing the non-equilibrium interactions characteristic of many forest, wetland, desert, and marine systems.

### 2.2 Incorporation of Trophic Network Analyses

Complementing process-based models, network analyses of food webs provide a lens to quantify energy and nutrient fluxes. Long-term studies (e.g., the 34-year Gulf of Riga series) have demonstrated that:

- **Interdependencies:** Multifunctional roles of species within ecological networks can reveal vulnerabilities and trade-offs among ecosystem services.

- **Facilitative and Complementary Interactions:** Interactions, such as pathogen dilution and microclimate amelioration provided by facilitator species, enhance stability and resilience.

- **Food Web Theory Integration:** Combined approaches merging BEF research with food web theory have resulted in improved management strategies by identifying keystone and vulnerable species across diverse ecosystems.

## 3. Technological Innovations in Quantifying Ecological Mechanisms

### 3.1 Imaging Integration and Gradient Experimental Designs

Modern experimental frameworks have seen the integration of advanced imaging techniques with gradient experimental designs:

- **Imaging Techniques:** Integrative methods, including fluorescence fluctuation microscopy and image correlation spectroscopy, enable the high-resolution quantification of both subcellular processes (e.g., 2-photon excited fluorescence in live zebrafish) and bulk fluid responses. These techniques are particularly useful in capturing microscale nonlinearities and providing insights into ecosystem-scale dynamics.

- **Gradient Designs vs. Replicated Sampling:** Empirical findings from both microgravity experiments (University of Milan and ASI collaborations) and long-term terrestrial studies have shown that gradient experimental designs often yield a better performance in predicting non-linear ecological responses. Relying on a wealth of sampling locations captures environmental heterogeneity more accurately than traditional replicated designs.

### 3.2 Advancements in Belowground Observation Techniques

Belowground processes have historically been obscured by soil opacity. Recent advances, however, have allowed for more precise investigations:

- **X-ray Tomography and Isotope Labeling:** These methods enable detailed visualization of root-soil interactions, overcoming previous observational limitations.

- **Meta-Barcoding:** This technique supports the identification of microbiome constituents, revealing complex interactions impacting nutrient cycling and ecosystem resilience.

*Key Insight:* The integration of these methods not only refines our understanding of root dynamics but also informs management practices in forests, wetlands, deserts, and marine ecosystems affected by global change.

## 4. Computational Frameworks and Nonlinear Dynamics

### 4.1 Mutual Information and FDTD Simulations

The emerging computational frameworks now incorporate mutual information analysis alongside finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. These tools allow for:

- **Mapping Environmental Fluctuations:** Capturing continuous variations in parameters like spatially varying diffusion coefficients, crucial for correctly modeling non-equilibrium behaviors.

- **Nonlinear Ecosystem Dynamics:** These methods reconcile observed dynamics with underlying nonlinear interactions, facilitating improved predictions of ecosystem functional responses under variable conditions.

### 4.2 Multitrophic Interaction Modelling

Recent theoretical frameworks integrating BEF with food web theory have solidified our understanding of:

- **Species Complementarity and Resource Partitioning:** These interactions drive efficient resource use and stability in ecosystems.

- **Facilitative Trophic Interactions:** In multi-species models, incorporating a modifier species can significantly alter interaction strengths, leading to cascading effects across the entire network.

*Key Insight:* The new empirical and theoretical framework for trophic interaction modifications highlights the necessity of incorporating multi-level contextual data to capture the complexity of ecosystem dynamics, far beyond traditional pairwise interaction models.
