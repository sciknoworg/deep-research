# Final Report: Realistic Pesticide Range in Experiments on Pesticide Impacts on Bees

This report provides a comprehensive analysis and synthesizes multiple research learnings regarding the determination of realistic pesticide ranges for experimental studies on bees. Our emphasis stems from the query regarding the appropriate dosing range for experiments that examine both lethal and sub-lethal impacts on bee health, colony dynamics, and behavior. This report integrates laboratory findings, field studies, and mechanistic insights on pesticide exposure to refine experimental designs. Below, we detail our findings over several key sections.

## I. Introduction

With mounting concerns over pollinator decline, accurately characterizing pesticide exposures is critical for risk assessments. This report focuses on establishing a realistic range of pesticide dosages for controlled experiments considering practical agricultural scenarios. The query addressed in this discussion relates to: 

- **Type of Pesticide**: Emphasis on neonicotinoids (e.g., clothianidin and dinotefuran) and comparisons with alternatives such as flupyradifurone and even classes like organophosphates. 
- **Exposure Conditions**: Deciding between laboratory simulations and field-realistic conditions, and understanding how environmental factors alter exposure dynamics.
- **Endpoints**: Concentrating on endpoints including mortality, sub-lethal behavioral modifications (e.g., impaired homing flight), and broader colony-level dynamics.

This report builds on three core research learnings which provide the necessary context for designing experiments that adhere to both realistic and sensitive detection protocols.

## II. Pesticide Toxicity and Exposure Metrics

### A. Sublethal Effects and Dose Sensitivity

Recent studies highlight that sublethal exposures to neonicotinoids can disrupt critical behaviors in bees. For instance:

- **Clothianidin**: Impairs homing flight success even at low doses (~2.18 ng/bee).
- **Dinotefuran**: Exhibits impacts at doses around 7.5 ng/bee.

These sublethal endpoint metrics are compromised with even slight increases in dose, implicating the necessity for a narrow, carefully managed range of exposure in experimental setups. Additionally, emerging formulations such as flupyradifurone demonstrate lower acute toxicity relative to traditional neonicotinoids and organophosphates, suggesting that the choice of formulation could affect both the range and sensitivity of the assay outcomes.

### B. Laboratory Recalibration via Contact Surface Analysis

Laboratory assessments using equipment such as a Potter-type tower have enabled precise quantification of the pesticide contact surface area on bees. Key findings include:

- **Surface Area Estimates**: An apparent exposure surface of 1.05 cm²/bee was observed in contrast with a more comprehensive physical area of 3.27 cm²/bee as determined via X-tomography.
- **Hazard Quotient Recalibration**: This refined measurement aids in more accurately aligning field-level pesticide application rates with individual bee LD50 values (commonly ≤2 µg/bee for pesticides of high toxicity).

These recalculations allow researchers to bridge laboratory dose metrics with field exposure scenarios, thus ensuring that laboratory conditions accurately reflect realistic dosages encountered in the environment.

## III. Field Study Insights: Realistic Exposure Metrics

Field studies have provided invaluable data for understanding actual pesticide deposition on bees during agrochemical applications:

- **Methodology**: Using fluorescent tracers in field settings such as apple orchards and Phacelia fields (studies conducted between 1992 and 1997) allowed for a robust collection of exposure data.

- **Measured Deposition Ranges**:
  - In orchards, deposition was recorded between 1.62 to 20.84 ng/bee.
  - In Phacelia fields, deposition was higher, ranging from 6.34 to 35.77 ng/bee.

These findings demonstrate variability based on application method, crop type, and environmental conditions, thereby emphasizing that even within field conditions, a range must be incorporated to capture the full spectrum of realistic exposures. The fact that deposition can be as low as ~1.6 ng/bee and up to ~35.8 ng/bee suggests a need for experiments to incorporate multiple dosing levels across a log-scale, possibly centering around the mid-point yet spanning order-of-magnitude differences.

## IV. Practical Experimental Design Considerations

### A. Determining the Dose Range

Based on the data from both laboratory recalibrations and field studies, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Lower Bound**: Consider a minimum dose of ~1.5–2 ng/bee as a realistic lower threshold, correlating with the minimal exposure recorded in orchards and aligning with sublethal impact data for neonicotinoids.

2. **Upper Bound**: For a worst-case realistic scenario, doses approaching ~35–40 ng/bee could be used, reflective of upper deposition levels in certain field conditions. These doses should be scrutinized for potential extensive colony impact.

3. **Intermediate Levels**: Incorporate multiple intermediate dosing levels (e.g., 5, 10, 15, and 20 ng/bee) to generate a complete dose-response curve that captures both sublethal and potential lethal effects.

### B. Laboratory Vs. Field Experimentation

- **Controlled Laboratory Studies**: Ensure that exposure conditions mimic realistic exposure surfaces. Utilizing approaches like the Potter-type tower provides precise control over dosing and can help correlate laboratory results with field expectations. Additionally, outcomes like homing flight can be observed in a controlled manner.

- **Field Simulation Studies**: Incorporate environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and UV exposure to simulate real-world conditions. One may conduct trials via mesocosms that provide semi-field conditions, thus balancing control with environmental realism.

### C. Endpoint Selection

1. **Mortality**: Though acute toxicity (LD50) is important, given the recalibrated contact area, comparing LD50 values with field deposition metrics is crucial.

2. **Sublethal Behavioral Changes**: Studies have documented homing behavior, foraging efficiency, and even changes in learning and memory in bees exposed to variable pesticide levels.

3. **Colony Dynamics**: Observing long-term impacts on the colony such as brood development, overall colony weight, and behavior during foraging will provide a wider context over chronic low-dose exposures.

### D. Consideration of Alternative Chemicals

While neonicotinoids are a primary focus due to their established sublethal impacts, emerging formulations like flupyradifurone or even representative organophosphates could be incorporated in comparative studies. This can help delineate the spectrum of effects attributable to different chemical properties and allow for more inclusive risk assessments.

## V. Concluding Recommendations and Future Directions

### A. Experimental Range Summary

For a realistic experiment assessing pesticide impacts on bees:

- **Dose Range**: Approximately 1.5–40 ng/bee, with finer subdivisions in the lower dose range to capture subtle sublethal effects.
- **Methodological Integration**: Utilize both precise laboratory techniques (e.g., Potter-type tower and physical surface recalibration) and field-derived deposition metrics to fully bridge knowledge across scales.
- **Endpoint Integration**: Include simultaneous measurement of acute toxicity (LD50), sublethal behavioral endpoints, and long-term colony dynamics.

### B. Advanced Considerations

1. **Modeling and Simulation**: Develop predictive exposure models integrating real-world variables (weather, spray drift dynamics) to simulate variable exposure levels, thus informing both laboratory and field studies.

2. **Chemical Synergy Studies**: Consider investigating interactions between multiple agrochemicals, as bees in the field may be exposed to multiple stressors simultaneously. This approach may yield counter-intuitive interactive toxicities that single-compound studies might miss.

3. **Sub-lethal Effect Mechanisms**: Deepen research into the physiological and molecular mechanisms behind sublethal effects. Advancements in omics and behavioral monitoring can elucidate precise pathways and potentially identify biomarkers for early warning of colony stress.

4. **Environmental Justice and Ecosystem Services**: Extend experiments to consider diverse environmental contexts, so as to better account for regions and bee species with differing exposure histories and resilience.

### C. Final Insights

The proposed dose ranges, derived from both empirical deposition studies and recalibrated laboratory exposure data, provide a robust framework for designing realistic pesticide exposure experiments. They balance a high level of control with field-realism, ensuring that the observed effects on bee health can be confidently extrapolated to natural conditions. Future work should continue to refine these ranges as new chemical formulations and application technologies emerge, emphasizing the importance of integrated assessment methods.

## VI. Summary

In conclusion, establishing a realistic pesticide range for experimental studies on bees necessitates an integrative approach that leverages both controlled laboratory parameters and empirical field data. The synthesis here recommends a dosing range roughly between 1.5 and 40 ng/bee, using a combination of acute, sublethal, and chronic endpoints. Researchers should also consider environmental modulations, inter-chemical synergies, and evolving formulations to fully capture the risk landscape. This comprehensive approach ensures that outcomes resonate with real-world agricultural practices and ultimately contribute to informed policy-making and conservation efforts.
