# Final Report on the Effects of Management Extensification on Grassland Plant Diversity

This comprehensive report synthesizes findings from multiple research endeavors on management extensification in grasslands and its impact on plant diversity. The report draws on a wide range of experiments, manipulative studies, long-term observations, mechanistic models, and cross-regional analyses to provide an integrative perspective with a focus on both aboveground and belowground dynamics, interaction with environmental gradients, and ecosystem multifunctionality. The following detailed discussion captures all the key learnings from research studies conducted in European, North American, and other diverse grassland ecosystems.

## 1. Introduction

Management extensification in grassland ecosystems is defined as the reduction of practices such as high levels of fertilization, intense grazing, and frequent mowing. Research over the past decades has indicated that such practices can lead to significant shifts in both plant diversity and ecosystem functioning. Extensive management strategies contrast with intensive approaches by allowing more natural ecosystem processes to occur, with potential gains in biodiversity. However, the secondary effects on various trophic groups (e.g., aboveground vascular plants versus belowground microbial communities) and the trade-offs between biodiversity and productivity remain subjects of active investigation.

This report collates insights from detailed experiments and long-term assessments that address multiple facets of the research question: *What is the effect of management extensification on grassland plant diversity?* The discussion is organized to cover mechanistic underpinnings, experimental insights, landscape interactions, and the broader implications for ecosystem management.

## 2. Contrasting Responses Between Above- and Belowground Processes

One of the prominent learnings is the contrasting response of above-ground and below-ground communities to management practices. Findings consistently demonstrate that while intensified management regimes generally diminish aboveground trophic groups (including plants and arthropods), belowground communities such as soil microbes and fungi may exhibit increased diversity. This divergence is largely attributed to the differential responses of these communities to disturbance and alterations in nutrient availability. Moreover, landscape factors such as adjacent permanent forest cover and heterogeneous land covers critically mediate these dynamics, underscoring the influence of broader spatial context on local biodiversity outcomes.

## 3. Targeted Species Mixtures and Manipulative Studies

Manipulative studies conducted in intensively managed grasslands, particularly trials involving species mixtures from one to six species (covering legumes, herbs, and grasses across 28 European sites), highlight the importance of species composition on ecosystem functioning. Results indicate that targeted mixtures—especially combinations that include legume-herb pairings—optimize ecosystem functions such as water availability, nutrient uptake, and invasion resistance. This research emphasizes that micro-scale species evenness, as well as the balance among functional groups, can drive positive functional responses, suggesting that management extensification might be best implemented by promoting carefully designed species assemblages rather than simple reductions in intensification.

## 4. Long-term Biodiversity Dynamics and Amplification Effects

Long-term experimental ecosystems have revealed that biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning tend to amplify over time. In both grasslands and forests, high-diversity communities show increased overall performance, while systems with lower diversity often exhibit reduced functioning. This temporal amplification is mediated by soil characteristics (e.g., nutrient availability, moisture) and differential competitive growth rates among species, suggesting that the benefits of extensification on biodiversity are often realized over longer periods. The dynamic nature of these systems calls for sustained monitoring to capture the full spectrum of biodiversity changes.

## 5. Spatial and Micro-topographical Gradients

In grasslands such as those found in sub-Mediterranean and central Italian regions, spatial heterogeneity plays a critical role in mediating functional diversity and productivity. Variations in soil depth, productivity, and even micro-climatic differences (e.g., sun exposure, drainage) contribute to complex trade-offs in ecosystem service provisioning. Bell-shaped productivity–diversity curves, frequently observed in these studies, underscore that the relationship between plant diversity and productivity is not linear; instead, it is subject to threshold effects and local environmental gradients. This finding urges a nuanced approach to implementing extensification practices that are sensitive to landscape-level variability.

## 6. Mechanistic Ecosystem Models and Fertilization Effects

Mechanistic ecosystem models applied in regions like the European Alps have unraveled the nuanced response of grassland productivity and nutrient dynamics to fertilization. These models demonstrate that the effects of nutrient inputs on NO3 leaching and overall productivity are highly contingent on local soil hydrology, elevation, and seasonal growing conditions. Notably, such research questions the utility of fixed nitrogen input thresholds, advocating instead for tailored, site-specific management practices. For grassland managers, this model-based insight provides a compelling argument for adjusting fertilization protocols based on local environmental metrics.

## 7. Interannual Variation in Land-Use Intensity

Investigations across 150 grassland sites have revealed that interannual variation in land-use intensity (LUI) – quantified by combined metrics of fertilization, grazing, and mowing – plays a significant role in enhancing whole-ecosystem multidiversity. Interestingly, this interannual variability appears to particularly benefit rare species, with their diversity increasing markedly (from 18% to 31% of maximum values) under variable LUI conditions. This suggests that dynamic management regimes, which allow for fluctuations rather than constant intensification, can potentially foster a more resilient and diverse plant community, including the persistence of less common species.

## 8. Extensification in European Upland Grasslands

Long-term studies of European upland grasslands over the past few decades offer illuminating insights into the trade-offs associated with management extensification. Reduced fertiliser inputs, lower stocking rates, and less intensive management practices have led to significant improvements in the biodiversity of soil, plant, and animal components. However, these gains come at the cost of decreased animal productivity. The reduction in animal outputs is speculated to be linked to changes in plant biomass allocation and shifts in soil nitrogen mineralization processes. This key trade-off points to the intrinsic tension between enhancing biodiversity and maintaining productive agricultural outputs, suggesting that extensification strategies need to be carefully balanced based on management objectives.

## 9. Climatic Influences on Soil Moisture and Nutrient Cycling

A critical mechanistic insight comes from the role of microclimatic variables, such as annual precipitation and temperature seasonality. The difference between mean summer and annual temperatures (TSIS) strongly influences soil moisture regimes, which in turn regulate microbial and detritivore activities, as well as nutrient cycling processes. This dependency on site-specific microclimatic conditions, observed in both global and European contexts, emphasizes that the effects of management extensification are not uniform. Managers must, therefore, integrate local climatic data into planning to optimize the balance between biodiversity gains and other ecosystem services.

## 10. Enhancing Ecosystem Multifunctionality Through Diversity

Experiments such as those conducted within the BIODEPTH network, spanning 16 sites across North America and Europe, illustrate that increased plant species richness consistently enhances ecosystem multifunctionality. The reinforcement of ecosystem productivity, stability, and overall functionality is largely attributed to complementarity effects among species rather than the dominance of a few. These results imply that management practices that promote species diversity can have a far-reaching impact on ecosystem resilience, particularly under stress conditions such as nutrient enrichment or drought. This reinforces the notion that extensification, when managed appropriately, offers a pathway to enhancing multiple ecosystem services simultaneously.

## 11. Integrative Mechanisms Linking Management Extensification and Plant Diversity

When synthesizing the aforementioned learnings, several recurring mechanisms become evident:

- **Above- vs. Belowground Dynamics:** Extensification controls lead to a contrasting set of responses where aboveground diversity may be curtailed under intensive management, but alleviating such pressures can help restore and even enhance belowground microbial communities.

- **Species Mixture and Complementarity:** The deliberate use of species mixtures, particularly those that balance functional traits (e.g., legumes with herbs), can promote ecosystem functions that might be compromised under uniform or intensified management regimes.

- **Temporal Amplification:** Biodiversity benefits from extensification are not immediate but manifest over long time scales, emphasizing the importance of multi-decadal management strategies.

- **Environmental Context and Local Specificity:** Variations in soil properties, micro-topography, and climatic conditions highlight the necessity of a context-specific approach rather than a one-size-fits-all strategy.

- **Trade-offs Between Biodiversity and Productivity:** While biodiversity, especially of rare species, tends to increase under variable and lower intensity management, there is a consistent trade-off with animal productivity and certain ecosystem outputs. Balancing these trade-offs remains a key challenge for land managers.

## 12. Conclusions and Future Research Directions

The evidence compiled in this report unequivocally demonstrates that management extensification significantly influences grassland plant diversity through a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors. The key conclusions include:

1. **Enhanced Biodiversity Over Time:** The gradual improvement in both above- and belowground diversity, particularly under extensification regimes, suggests long-term benefits for ecosystem resilience and function.

2. **Mechanistic Complexity:** The differential responses of above-ground and below-ground communities, interactions between species, and the influence of local landscape and climatic conditions all contribute to the overall dynamics of plant diversity. Future studies would benefit from integrated models that simultaneously account for these multiscale processes.

3. **Tailored Management Strategies:** Fixed thresholds for interventions (e.g., fertilization) are unlikely to be universally effective. Instead, adaptive management that responds to site-specific conditions is required to maximize both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

4. **Implications for Ecosystem Multifunctionality:** Enhancement of biodiversity is tightly linked to improved ecosystem multifunctionality, particularly through the reinforcement of complementarity effects among plant species. This relationship should be harnessed to design multifunctional landscapes that maintain both productivity and conservation goals.

5. **Balancing Trade-offs:** The inherent trade-offs noted between plant/soil biodiversity and animal productivity point to a need for balanced management policies. Innovative solutions—such as rotational extensification, integrative agroecological practices, and dynamic nutrient management—should be explored further. For instance, integrating early-season extensification with targeted late-season interventions might mitigate productivity losses while promoting biodiversity.

**Future Research Needs:**

- Longitudinal studies that extend beyond current time horizons to capture delayed biodiversity responses and successional dynamics.
- Development of mechanistic models that integrate microclimatic data with landscape-level heterogeneity to predict management outcomes more reliably.
- Exploration of contrarian management strategies, including the possibility of adaptive or dynamic extensification, which could bridge the gap between conservation and agricultural productivity.
- Cross-continental comparative studies to ensure the generalizability of findings across varied grassland ecosystems.

In summary, management extensification emerges as a promising avenue for enhancing plant diversity and overall ecosystem health in grasslands. However, successful implementation hinges on an in-depth understanding of local environmental contexts, species interactions, and long-term ecological processes. The detailed insights outlined in this report provide a robust foundation for further exploration and the development of nuanced management interventions tailored to specific ecological scenarios.
