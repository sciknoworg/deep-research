# Can Herbivory Modulate the Effects of Global Change on Plant Communities?  
**A synthetic review integrating >60 recent experimental, observational and modelling studies**  

---

## 1  Scope and framing
Global change (GC) drivers—including elevated CO₂ (eCO₂), warming, altered precipitation, enhanced nitrogen (N) deposition, and land-use change—are reshaping the structure and functioning of plant communities. Herbivores, from soil mites to reintroduced megafauna, influence virtually every plant trait that mediates GC responses (leaf economics, stature, phenology, stoichiometry, defence chemistry). The core question is therefore not *whether* herbivory matters, but *how, when and in which direction* herbivore activity amplifies, attenuates or even overrides GC impacts. Drawing on **all 58 learnings listed** plus complementary literature, we synthesise mechanisms, cross-biome evidence, guild contrasts and management implications.

## 2  Mechanistic pathways linking herbivory and GC drivers

| Pathway | Direction of influence | Representative evidence |
|---------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Direct biomass removal & plant architecture** | Herbivores truncate canopy height, maintain open swards, control dominance, modulate light and temperature in the boundary layer. | Arctic exclusion raised vegetative height +50 % vs grazed plots (learning 12); goose grubbing eliminated tundra C sink (3, 14). |
| **Trait-mediated feedbacks** | Grazing selects for low stature, high tillering, or chemical defences, altering community‐weighted means that determine GC sensitivity. | Shade-avoidance vs defence trade-off via ST2a sulphotransferase (32); LOX6-mediated JA defence costs (4, 38). |
| **Nutrient return & redistribution** | Urine, dung, frass accelerate or decelerate N and P cycling; spatial patterning matters. | Elevated CO₂ increased insect frass-C and ‑N fluxes 32–63 % (2); N mineralisation highest with invertebrates only (8, 23). |
| **Soil physical modification** | Trampling, burrowing, snow compaction alter temperature and moisture regimes, with knock-on effects on permafrost or fire risk. | Siberian megafauna compact snow, cool permafrost by ≥4 °C (5, 25). |
| **Hydrological engineering** | Herbivores create/destroy water points, modify ET, influence drought sensitivity. | Feral equids dig ≤2 m wells in deserts (20); eCO₂ cut ET by 22 % in tallgrass prairie (15) but warming neutralised that in tropical grass (50). |
| **Biotic interactions** | Vertebrate grazers can suppress or release insect herbivores and pathogens; altered trophic cascades feed back on plant communities. | Cattle raised grass N but lowered grasshopper fitness (9); N addition raised insect + pathogen damage globally (45, 46). |
| **Disturbance & successional resets** | Browsing keeps shrubification in check, modulates fire regimes, interacts with nutrient legacies. | Circumpolar survey: herbivores suppress warming-driven shrubification (13); megaherbivore loss increased fire frequency in palaeo-records (33). |

## 3  Driver-specific syntheses

### 3.1  Elevated CO₂
• **Plant stoichiometry and forage quality**. FACE and OTC studies reveal systematic N dilution in grasses (18) and legumes’ shift toward P fixation (18). eCO₂ can increase defence metabolites (41) yet competition nullifies this (41). In tropical C₄ forage, eCO₂ raised water-use efficiency, but 2 °C warming cancelled it and deepened protein decline (50).  
• **Nutrient cycling via herbivores**. In Populus FACE, eCO₂ ↑ frass C & N fluxes by 32–63 % (2), potentially accelerating soil C turnover if decomposer communities are N-limited.  
• **Interaction with N deposition**. Cotton/fescue data (44) show nitrate availability gates hormonal and proteomic responses under eCO₂; thus grazer‐mediated N return could modulate those thresholds.

### 3.2  Atmospheric and climatic warming
• **Snow insulation paradox**. High densities of large herbivores compact snow and cool permafrost (5, 25)—a negative feedback to warming.  
• **Trait filtering**. Tundra warming (+1 °C) effects on height and SLA manifested only when herbivores were absent (12); under long-term heavy grazing, ecosystems became C-poor yet warming-resistant (24).  
• **Metabolic coupling**. Warming delayed N release from CO₂-stimulated C₄ roots (30), suggesting grazing that removes C₄ biomass could free N earlier, softening constraints.

### 3.3  Altered precipitation & drought
• **Hydrological feedbacks**. eCO₂-induced ET reduction (15) can alleviate drought; removal of herbivores that maintain shorter canopies may offset this benefit by increasing leaf area index (LAI).  
• **Forage quality under compound extremes**. +3 °C drought favoured grasses’ fructan storage over legumes, driving legume protein–mineral decline (7, 47). Grazers selecting nutrient-rich patches may intensify pressure on already stressed legumes.

### 3.4  Nitrogen enrichment
• **Diversity loss & extinction debt**. NutNet synthesis (1) shows chronic N drives ongoing local extinction; early colonisation deficits plateau. Vertebrate grazing can buffer dominance but only to a point—global results indicate grazing history conditions plant richness responses (57).  
• **Suppression of legumes**. N addition overrides P/K benefits for N-fixers (17) and depresses legume biomass; vertebrate herbivores that preferentially consume legumes (e.g., horses at high stocking boosted legumes, 36) may further exacerbate or relieve this, depending on selectivity.  
• **Bottom-up effects on invertebrates**. Added N ↑ arthropod biomass (22) and damage (45, 46); vertebrate grazing marginally lowers arthropods, hinting at compensatory pathways.

### 3.5  Land-use change, grazing intensity & trophic rewilding
• Moderate grazing maintains lower fuels than long exclusion (48) and can even raise SOC under mixed herds (40) or high-density rotational schemes (11).  
• Rewilding megaherbivores could shift albedo, fire, methane and C storage (19) but models lack plant–animal coupling modules—an urgent research gap.  
• Equid vs ruminant functional differences matter: higher intake rates (6), water dependency (42) and grazing-lawn creation (37, 39) produce distinct spatial heterogeneity and nutrient hotspots.

---

## 4  Cross-biome patterns

### 4.1  Grasslands
• **Grazing × climate extremes**. Meta-analysis (34) ranks “4 °C + half precipitation + high grazing” as worst for production and richness, but extra rain under low–moderate grazing can enhance ANPP.  
• **Carbon sequestration**. eCO₂ converted tallgrass prairie to stronger C sink (15); rotational high-density grazing boosted SOC +21 % (11). Sheep alone cut SOC in diverse plots, cattle had neutral effect, mixed herds positive (40).  
• **N cycling**. Body-size shifts (31) and invertebrate dominance (8) modulate mineralisation more than two centuries of land-use history.

### 4.2  Temperate & boreal forests
Leaf-chewing insects under eCO₂ return more C and tannins to soil (2), potentially priming decomposition. Yet ozone can dampen N return (2). Long-term Populus FACE shows sustained below-ground C input despite O₃ (23). The net outcome depends on herbivore community response to altered foliar chemistry—still understudied.

### 4.3  Arctic & tundra systems

1. **Goose overabundance**: Grubbing flips C sink to source (3, 14); but exclosures show rapid above-ground recovery and net CO₂ uptake within 4 years (41).  
2. **Shrubification control**: Vertebrates counter warming-driven shrub gains, maintain richness (13).  
3. **Permafrost conservation**: Snow compaction by megafauna could preserve 80 % near-surface permafrost under RCP 8.5 (5, 25). [Speculative: large-scale rewilding projects might yield negative-cost climate mitigation if social licence issues are resolved.]

### 4.4  Wetlands & salt-marshes
Large herbivores depress N mineralisation in clayey marshes via trampling-induced anoxia (16). Similar mechanisms may interact with sea-level rise by slowing decomposition and peat formation. Management could alternate grazing pressures seasonally.

### 4.5  Drylands & deserts
Feral equid wells (20) extend riparian zones, potentially enhancing woody recruitment and soil C. Livestock exclusion in sagebrush steppe tripled fine fuels (48), suggesting moderate grazing as a fire-mitigation tool under hotter, drier futures.

## 5  Guild-specific contrasts

1. **Invertebrates** – Rapid nutrient recycling, fine-scale selective pressure; can override mammal effects on mineralisation (8).  
2. **Small mammals** – Vole upsurge after cattle removal raised N mineralisation (31).  
3. **Native large herbivores** – Reindeer density stability maximised economic & climate benefits (27).  
4. **Domestic livestock** – Stocking density and species mix alter SOC and biodiversity outcomes (36, 40).  
5. **Equids** – High intake rates, lawn creation, water engineering; interact differently with GC (6, 37, 42).  
6. **Megafauna (rewilded)** – Snow compaction cooling, fire suppression, albedo effects (5, 19, 33). 

---

## 6  Emergent synthesis
Herbivory exerts bidirectional modulation on GC impacts through *three cascading arenas*:

1. **Resource availability** – By redistributing N, P and water, herbivores set the nutrient and moisture template on which GC drivers act.
2. **Trait filtering & diversity** – Grazing’s control of dominance, stature, and chemical defences changes community-weighted trait means that determine sensitivity to eCO₂, warming and drought.
3. **Physical & biogeochemical engineering** – Snow, soil, fuel loads and hydrological modifications feed back into regional climate and disturbance regimes.

Where herbivore pressure aligns with historical baselines, communities often display greater *resilience* to GC (e.g., heavy-grazed tundra warming resistance). Where pressure is novel—hyperabundant geese or long grazing exclusion—systems tip toward *amplified* GC impacts (carbon loss, megafire risk).

## 7  Management implications & solutions you may not have considered

1. **Dynamic grazing mosaics** – Rotational, high-density pulses followed by rest can harness positive SOC gains (11) while retaining heterogeneity that benefits equid foraging efficiency and arthropod diversity.
2. **Snow-management via megafauna rewilding** – A cost-negative climate stabilisation lever for permafrost regions (5, 25). Pilot projects could piggyback on carbon markets.
3. **Selective legume support under N deposition** – Targeted reduction of grazing intensity during flowering of N-fixers, or use of equid grazers which boosted legume cover (36), to maintain forage quality and N inputs.
4. **Pyric-herbivory in fire-prone rangelands** – Integrating patch-burning with moderate grazing suppresses fuel loads (48) without sacrificing production, synergising with predicted hotter droughts.
5. **Multispecies livestock systems** – Mixing sheep and cattle exploits complementary foraging, raising SOC (40) and buffering drought-induced production losses.
6. **Trait-based monitoring** – Using community-weighted SLA, height and foliar C:N shifts as early indicators of GC × herbivory interaction strength; remote sensing (e.g., NDVI shrubification metrics) can guide adaptive stocking.
7. **Integrating plant–herbivore modules into Earth-system models** – Current DGVMs ignore animal feedbacks; incorporating snow compaction, trait filtering and nutrient return could improve carbon-climate projections.

## 8  Research gaps & priorities
1. **Tropical multi-factorial experiments** mixing herbivores with CO₂ × temperature × precipitation treatments remain scarce (<5 % of studies).  
2. **Below-ground herbivory and microbiome feedbacks** under GC are understudied; root-feeding invertebrates may shift with soil moisture and CO₂.  
3. **Long-term extinction debt under N enrichment** (1) implies hidden vulnerability; need genetic and demographic monitoring to detect impending losses.  
4. **Socio-ecological feasibility** of megafaunal snow engineering and large-scale grazing manipulations requires cross-disciplinary research.

---

## 9  Conclusions
Herbivory can *both* buffer and magnify the ecological consequences of global change on plant communities. The direction and magnitude hinge on guild identity, stocking density, evolutionary history and interaction with specific GC drivers. Recognising herbivores as **active climate engineers**—not merely consumers—opens novel avenues for mitigation (snow compaction, fuel reduction) and adaptation (trait-based management, multispecies grazing). Embedding these dynamics into policy and modelling frameworks is critical to avoid mis-forecasting biosphere responses.

[Speculation flag] Wider adoption of trophic rewilding coupled with precision livestock management could, by mid-century, deliver gigaton-scale carbon benefits while enhancing biodiversity, but only if economic incentives align and herbivore densities are adaptively tuned to shifting climatic baselines.
