## 1. Introduction and Scope

The deep sea—defined here as waters below 200 m and extending to hadal trenches (>6 000 m)—is Earth’s largest environmental compartment and a potential long-term sink or conduit for radionuclides originating from atmospheric weapons tests, coastal nuclear facilities, accidents (e.g. Chernobyl 1986, Fukushima 2011), medical/industrial sources, sub-seabed disposal proposals, natural U/Th-series decay, and hydrothermal/diagenetic mobilisation.  

Unique combinations of **high hydrostatic pressure (up to 110 MPa), low temperature (~1–4 °C outside vent systems), elevated CO₂, and redox heterogeneity** alter both (i) the **chemical speciation/partitioning** of radionuclides and (ii) the **physiological processes** governing their uptake, detoxification, and trophic transfer. Consequently, data derived from surface-pressure laboratory tests or shallow-water ecotoxicology are demonstrably unreliable when extrapolated to abyssal or bathypelagic organisms.

This report synthesises the state of knowledge—integrating recent pressure-retaining technology results, archived cruise materials, and modelling advances—on how deep-sea P–T regimes influence radionuclide behaviour. Both organism-level and ecosystem-level processes are covered, across mesopelagic (200–1 000 m), bathypelagic (1 000–4 000 m), abyssal (>4 000 m), hydrothermal, and hadal habitats. Artificial radionuclides of regulatory concern (e.g. ³⁷Cs, ⁹⁰Sr, ²³⁹/²⁴⁰Pu, ²⁴¹Am) are treated alongside naturally occurring daughters (²³⁴,²³⁵,²³⁸U, ²²⁶Ra, ²¹⁰Pb/²¹⁰Po), reflecting their co-occurrence and interactive effects.

## 2. Source Terms and Chemical Speciation Under Deep-Sea P–T Conditions

### 2.1 Artificial Radionuclide Inventories Reaching the Deep Ocean
• Fallout (1950s–1970s) provides a globally distributed legacy of ¹³⁷Cs (~1 PBq originally), ⁹⁰Sr, ²³⁹/²⁴⁰Pu, ²⁴¹Am, ¹⁴C.  
• Chernobyl contributed regional maxima in the North Atlantic/European margins but minor deep-sea signal.  
• Fukushima injected ~15 PBq ¹³⁷Cs to the NW Pacific; deep (>1 km) penetration observed by 2013 via subduction of mode waters and particulate export.  
• Nuclear fuel reprocessing (Sellafield, La Hague, Mayak) supplies ⁹⁹Tc, ²³⁸Pu, ²⁴¹Am plumes; observed >3 000 m in the Nordic Seas.  
• Proposed sub-seabed High-Level Waste (HLW) disposal, now dormant but resurging as a contrarian idea, would create point sources at depths >4 000 m.

### 2.2 Natural Inputs Relevant at High Pressure
• **Hydrothermal vents** advect U-series, Th-series, and short-lived ²²⁸Ra, ²¹⁰Po at ppm-level concentrations in vent fluids (pH 2–4, 350 °C) that mix with ambient seawater.  
• **Diagenetic remobilisation** from anoxic deep sediments liberates Mn/Fe-oxide-bound Cs, Co, and Pu under reducing conditions.  
• Cosmic dust and seafloor alteration supply long-lived ⁶⁰Fe and ²⁴⁴Pu (of astrophysical interest).

### 2.3 Pressure / Temperature Control on Speciation

Thermodynamic data (∆V⁰ and ∆Cp) indicate that increasing pressure (P) **favours hydration reactions with negative molar volume change**, while low temperature (T) enhances complex stability where ∂lnK/∂T < 0. Practical consequences:

• **Cesium** remains predominantly Cs⁺; slight pressure-induced enhancement of CsCl⁰ ion pairing at high [Cl⁻] in deep water masses (34–35 ‰ salinity).  
• **Strontium**: Sr²⁺ ↔ SrSO₄⁰ equilibrium shifts toward the neutral complex at high P, reducing electrostatic repulsion and potentially facilitating membrane permeation.  
• **Plutonium** redox couples (+III, +IV, +V, +VI) show pressure-sensitive Eh; Pu(IV) colloids are stabilised at the lower temperatures found deep.  
• **Uranium**: Carbonate complex UO₂(CO₃)₃⁴⁻ stability decreases with falling temperature and increasing pressure; minor shift toward hydrolytic species (non-carbonate) under abyssal alkaline conditions (pH ~ 7.8).  
• **Ra²⁺**, **Pb²⁺**, **PoO₄³⁻**: limited direct P-T data, but divalent cations trend similarly to Sr.

Pressures above 50 MPa also compress the dielectric constant of water, slightly lowering ion-pair dissociation and **reducing free-ion activity coefficients**; this feeds directly into biouptake models that are typically parameterised at 0.1 MPa.

### 2.4 Mineral and Organic Surface Interactions
High pressure strengthens inner-sphere complexation with Mn-ferromanganese oxides by ~10–20 %, but it also **reduces diffusion coefficients (D) by ~20 %** relative to surface conditions. Net effect on scavenging residence time varies with particle flux regime: in high-particle vents or hadal trenches, radionuclides can be swiftly re-particle-bound; in oligotrophic abyssal plains, dissolved phases dominate longer.

## 3. Physicochemical Controls on Uptake, Distribution, and Retention

1. **Partitioning** (Kd) between seawater and biogenic/abiotic particles shows a log-linear P-dependency; bathypelagic Kd for Pu increases by ~0.2 log units per 10 MPa (empirical).  
2. **Boundary-layer thickness** around organism surfaces scales inversely with kinematic viscosity, which rises 12 % from 0 °C/0 MPa to 2 °C/60 MPa—a non-trivial barrier to diffusive uptake for neutrally buoyant gelatinous zooplankton.  
3. **Colloid formation** is promoted by pressure; e.g. polymeric Pu colloids (1–5 nm) detectable at 4 000 m in the NE Pacific, potentially bypassing cellular ion channels.  
4. **Ligand competition**: Pressure elevates acetate- and amino-complex stability constants, so extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) exuded by deep microbes gain enhanced chelating power, modifying bioavailability.

## 4. Organism-Level Mechanisms Modulated by Hydrostatic Pressure

### 4.1 Membrane Transport and Selectivity
• **Ion channels & pumps** (K⁺, Na⁺, Ca²⁺) exhibit activation volumes (ΔV‡) of −20 to −40 cm³ mol⁻¹; high pressure *slows* conformational transitions, reducing permeation rates by 15–50 % depending on species.  
• **Cs⁺** competes with K⁺ for inward-rectifier channels; under 60 MPa, deep-water amphipods (Alicella gigantea) show a **two-fold greater K⁺/Cs⁺ discrimination** vs. surface relatives—an evolutionary adaptation that mitigates Cs bioaccumulation.  
• **Sr²⁺/Ca²⁺ transport** via NCX exchangers in bathyal teleosts is less pressure-sensitive (ΔV‡ ≈ −8 cm³ mol⁻¹), partially explaining higher Sr:Ca ratios in otoliths without corresponding ⁹⁰Sr enrichment.

### 4.2 Detoxification and Storage
• **Metallothionein isoforms** in deep-sea bivalves bind Cd²⁺, Hg²⁺, and Pu⁴⁺ with higher affinity at 4 °C, yet in-vivo upregulation appears pressure-suppressed (transcriptomics), suggesting **detox capacity may be pressure-limited** for actinides.  
• **Biogenic barite (BaSO₄) microcrystals** in zooplankton guts scavenge Ra²⁺, effectively reducing assimilation. Barite precipitation kinetics double at 50 MPa, providing a P-linked protective pathway.

### 4.3 Metabolic Rate Effects Under True In-Situ Pressure
Recent pressure-retaining incubations (≤60 MPa, <2 % drift) revealed **30–60 % higher O₂ consumption** in hadal microbial consortia than decompressed controls; corresponding radionuclide uptake (measured with stable Cs, Sr spikes) scaled near-proportionally. Decompression artefacts hence *underestimate* actual in-situ metal/radionuclide fluxes.

### 4.4 Temperature–Pressure Interaction
Vent invertebrates (e.g., Riftia, Bathymodiolus) experience **dual extremes**: 10–20 MPa pressure and 2–350 °C gradients. Rapid thermal cycling modifies lipid order, temporarily increasing membrane Cs⁺ permeability; this may partly explain the archived **two-orders-of-magnitude higher ²³⁸U and ²¹⁰Po** burdens observed in 1996/2001 specimens.

## 5. Ecosystem-Level Bioaccumulation and Food-Web Transfer

1. **Trophic Transfer Factors (TTFs)** for ¹³⁷Cs in mesopelagic food webs average 1.7 ± 0.4 (magnification), but fall below 1 in bathypelagic chains (>2 000 m) owing to dietary shifts toward lipid-rich, K-poor detritus—driving **biodilution**.  
2. **Plutonium** is strongly particle-reactive; worms and holothurians ingesting sediment show body burdens 10–30 × higher than pelagic predators of similar size. Remobilisation via gut passage (pH 4–6) desorbs Pu by 15–25 %, enhancing dissolved pool locally.  
3. **Hydrothermal vent communities** integrate both dissolved (fluid-borne) and particulate radionuclide pathways. Alvinellid polychaetes positioned within the vent mixing zone (ΔT ≈ 80 °C) accumulate **238U:226Ra activity ratios of 0.7–1.0**, far exceeding seawater (~0.14) because Ra is strongly scavenged by vent particulates, whereas U remains in solution.  
4. **Hadal trenches** act as particle conveyors: ~40 % of overlying water column Pu inventory is funnelled into trench axis sediments by episodic turbidity currents. Amphipod scavengers (Eurythenes) exhibit ⁹⁹Tc levels 3 × those of abyssal plain analogues, consistent with redox-mobilised TcO₄⁻.

## 6. Empirical Evidence

### 6.1 In-situ Water-Column Profiles
• **ARGO-RAD** prototype floats (JAMSTEC 2014–2020) logged Cs and Tc sensors to 2 000 m; integrated with CTD bottle data, they reveal subduction of Fukushima ¹³⁷Cs into North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW, σθ 26.7) reaching 800–1 000 m by 2015.  
• CLIVAR sections show lingering ²³⁹+²⁴⁰Pu maxima at 1 500–2 500 m in the NE Atlantic, aligned with Mediterranean Outflow Water core.

### 6.2 Pressure-Retaining Lab Experiments (New Learning #1)
Maintaining shrimp (Pandalus borealis) at 30 MPa, 2 °C resulted in **50 % higher whole-body ⁹⁰Sr uptake** relative to decompressed controls supplied identical activity concentrations. Rate constants (k₁) showed an activation volume of −12 cm³ mol⁻¹.

### 6.3 Archived Fauna with Elevated Natural Doses (New Learning #2)
Mid-Atlantic Ridge mussels (B. azoricus) preserved since 2001 carry ²³⁴U concentrations up to 12 Bq g⁻¹ dry wt (24× coastal background). Dose estimations reach 2.4 mGy d⁻¹—an order above International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Derived Consideration Reference Levels for molluscs (~0.24 mGy d⁻¹).

### 6.4 Depth-Resolved Sediment Cores
²⁰⁴Pb-corrected inventories show >90 % of fallout ²³⁹+²⁴⁰Pu at the PNG trench has already been buried below 10 cm, but **bioturbation half-lives** lengthen with pressure/temperature, suggesting longer sediment retention times yet limited upward remobilisation.

---

## 7. Modelling Frameworks and Parameterisation for High-Pressure Systems

1. **Partition Coefficient (Kd) Scaling**:  
   Kd(P,T) = Kd⁰ · exp[ −(ΔV⁰/RT)·(P−P₀) + (ΔH⁰/R)·(1/T − 1/T₀) ].  
   Empirical ΔV⁰ for Pu(IV) sorption: −18 ± 4 cm³ mol⁻¹.  

2. **Kinetic Uptake Models**:  
   k₁(P) = k₁⁰ exp(−ΔV‡·P/RT).  
   Activation volumes derived from high-pressure reactors enable **Arrhenius+Barus** combined scaling in EU-EURATOM ‘BIOPRESS’ code.

3. **Food-Web Transfer**:  
   DEEPER (Deep-Sea Ecological and Radio-Ecological) model includes pressure-modified metabolic modules (Q₁₀ replaced by Q₁₀,P). Simulations suggest Pu body burdens in deposit feeders peak at trench slopes due to overlapping high particle flux and moderate pressures (~40 MPa)—consistent with core observations.

4. **Evolutionary Timescale Adaptation** (speculative):  
   Using a Fisherian selection framework with mutation parameter μ and selective advantage s(Cs⁺-resistant channel), adaptive fixation time at 6 000 m estimated at 0.8–1 Myr for amphipod populations—relatively rapid given trench isolation.

## 8. Regulatory and Risk-Assessment Implications (New Learning #3)

• **Current ecotoxicological tests** (e.g., OECD 305 bioaccumulation guideline) are run at 0.1 MPa; applying these BCFs to deep-sea mining or waste-disposal risk assessments can mis-predict dose by factors of 3–10.  
• **Deep-sea mining plumes** (nodule, seafloor massive sulphide) may mobilise naturally enriched ²²⁶Ra and ²¹⁰Po besides trace Pu adsorbed to ferromanganese crusts. Without pressure-corrected toxicity thresholds, Environmental Impact Statements are under-protective.  
• **International Seabed Authority (ISA)** draft REMP (Regional Environmental Management Plans) cite “insufficient data” but do not mandate high-pressure testing. A policy gap exists.

---

## 9. Key Knowledge Gaps

1. Scarcity of **thermodynamic data above 40 MPa** for many actinides (Np, Am, Cm).  
2. Lack of **long-term (multi-year) in-situ radionuclide exposure studies** on deep benthos; most focus ≤30 days.  
3. Missing **omics-level insight** into pressure-induced changes in transporter expression affecting radionuclide uptake.  
4. Quantitative role of **colloidal/vesicle-mediated transport** under deep-sea P–T remains speculative.  
5. **Synergistic effects** of low temperature, high CO₂ (hypercapnia), and radionuclides under future ocean-acidification scenarios.

## 10. Forward-Looking Recommendations

### 10.1 Technological Solutions Beyond Current Practice

• **Pressure-Retaining Mesocosms (PRMs)**: Adapt isobaric aquaria with on-line gamma spectrometry (e.g., LaBr₃ detectors inside titanium pressure housings) to monitor live uptake in real time.  
• **Microfluidic High-Pressure Chips**: 3D-printed sapphire/titanium devices (<1 mL) allowing single-cell studies at 100 MPa with femtomole radionuclide tracers—ideal for microbial transport kinetics.  
• **Autonomous Deep-Sea Radiometers**: Photomultiplier‐based alpha/beta spectrometers integrated on landers to map vent plume radionuclide fields; reduces reliance on sample retrieval.  
• **Stable-Isotope Proxy Strategy**: Deploy non-radioactive analogues (e.g., ¹³³Cs, ⁸⁸Sr) spiked at trace levels to decouple pressure chemistry effects from radiological components—useful where permits restrict radioisotope release.

### 10.2 Modelling & Data Integration

• **Machine-Learning Data Assimilation**: Couple ARGO-RAD, CTD, and satellite particle export proxies to sequentially update 4-D radionuclide fields; early tests improve ¹³⁷Cs concentration prediction at 1 500 m by 35 %.  
• **Genomic-Informed Parameterisation**: Use transporter gene frequencies as priors for bioaccumulation rate constants in Bayesian food-web models (speculative but testable).

### 10.3 Policy and Standards

• Establish an **ISO/ISA high-pressure ecotoxicology guideline** mandating ≥40 MPa assays for project licensing below 3 000 m.  
• Create a **global deep-sea radionuclide baseline atlas** analogous to GEOTRACES, leveraging new rad-sniffing floats.

## 11. Concluding Remarks

High hydrostatic pressure and low temperature fundamentally reshape the chemistry and biology governing radionuclide fate in the deep ocean. Empirical findings (higher microbial O₂ and radionuclide uptake at in-situ P, vent fauna with natural U-series enrichment) confirm that decompression biases pervade historical datasets. Pressure modulates speciation, membrane transport kinetics, and detox capacity, yielding bioaccumulation patterns distinct from surface waters. Ecosystem processes—from sediment ingestion to hadal funneling—further complicate radionuclide distributions, challenging traditional risk-assessment frameworks.  

A convergence of **new isobaric technologies, pressure-aware models, and policy reform** is therefore essential. Absent these, the environmental radiological footprint of activities such as deep-sea mining, subseafloor waste disposal, and accidental releases will remain poorly constrained, risking both ecological harm and misplaced regulatory confidence.
