## 1  Motivation & Scope
Large Language Models (LLMs) express *latent* world knowledge captured during pre-training. When that knowledge is wrong, outdated, or missing, the model hallucinates. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corrects this by injecting *explicit* evidence at inference time. The present report focuses on the **directed-retrieval** half of the problem: *How can the LLM itself generate better queries, guide the retrieval stack, and reason over evidence so that downstream factuality measurably improves?*

Key angles covered:
• Algorithmic techniques for query generation, expansion and reranking.  
• Architectures that loop retrieval and generation (DSP-style), add metadata (RAGONITE) or causal scoring (CARAG).  
• Empirical lessons on factuality gains, robustness and remaining bottlenecks.  
• Practical design patterns, evaluation schemes, and speculative / contrarian ideas for the next RAG wave.

We remain domain-agnostic but give notes for open-domain QA, enterprise search, biomedical and legal verticals where relevant.

## 2  A Taxonomy of LLM-Directed Retrieval
The literature now coalesces around four interacting levers:

1. **Query Generation & Expansion**  
   • Prompt-only (few-shot, chain-of-thought, generator-validator loops).  
   • Dual-encoder or generative-dense retrievers fine-tuned with in-context feedback.  
   • Classical IR add-ons (SBQE, dependency pruning, keyword boosting).
2. **Contextual Retrieval Control**  
   • Conversational grounding (RAGONITE’s metadata, Google’s dialog context).  
   • Subset-of-Interest graphs (CARAG) or implicit topic segmentation.  
3. **Evidence Attribution & Scoring**  
   • Similarity only (baseline dense retrieval).  
   • Counterfactual causal tests (RAGONITE).  
   • Graph-theoretic thematic weighting (CARAG).  
4. **Iterative Architectures**  
   • Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP).  
   • API-call sandwiching (Google TDCommons).  
   • Generator-Validator-Optimizer (Know-Where-to-Go).

## 3  Synthesised Findings from Recent Literature
### 3.1  RAGONITE (ACL 2024)
• **Problem**: ConvQA RAG pipelines lose context when passages are truncated and provide only plausibility-based provenance.  
• **Method**: (1) Append structured metadata (space, page hierarchy) + ±3 sentences of surrounding text. (2) Score each passage via *counterfactual attribution*: drop the passage, regenerate, observe delta in log-likelihood.  
• **Results**: On **ConfQuestions** (300 bilingual EN/DE turns over 215 Atlassian Confluence pages):  
 – BLEU ↑4.7, grounded accuracy ↑14 %.  
 – Causal explanations preferred by 71 % of annotators vs similarity baselines.  
• **Take-away**: Causal “ablation” scoring is lightweight (single extra LM call) yet outperforms heavy rerankers; rich metadata mitigates snippet myopia.

### 3.2  Google TDCommons #6407 (2023)
• **Insight**: LLM is prompted to emit a *structured API request* after seeing in-context similar requests fetched from an updatable index. The result docs are then re-fed with system instructions to craft the final reply.  
• **Implications**: Domain extension ≈ editing the example index. Avoids retraining and enables domain-specific retrieval control; the LLM orchestrates the entire tool chain.

### 3.3  CARAG (2024)
• **Novelty**: Builds a *Subset-of-Interest (SOI) graph* by clustering evidence topics offline. At runtime, thematic embeddings are blended with the claim to steer retrieval.  
• **Metrics** (FactVer dataset): evidence precision ↑6 %, explanation Cosmos-Eval ↑9 %.  
• **Crucial Point**: Graph provides *human-readable retrieval rationales*, a step toward regulatory explainability.

### 3.4  RUCAIBox Studies (2023)
• Adding RAG to ChatGPT improved open-domain QA accuracy by 8-12 pp and reduced over-confident hallucinations by ~35 %.  
• Yet, models *over-trust* low-quality snippets—evidence selection quality is the new bottleneck.

### 3.5  Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP, 2022)
• Three-stage programmatic chain (demonstrate → search → predict) beats vanilla LMs by 37-200 %.  
• Gains over *standard* retrieve-then-read prove that **LLM-generated search queries**, iterated with feedback, are decisive.

### 3.6  Know-Where-to-Go (2023)
• Treats the LLM itself as a generative retriever. Generator proposes URLs; Validator checks factual alignment; Optimizer reranks.  
• Conceptually a PageRank successor for the LLM era; early experiments show better *responsibility* (reliable citation) and *trust* (user scoring) than baselines.

### 3.7  Robustness & Classic IR Insights
• **Large-scale perturbation study** (1 M queries) reveals instability ⇒ retrieval must be robust to paraphrase & noise.  
• **TREC evidence**: linear relation between retrieval quality & factoid QA—error budget still dominated by recall.  
• **Sentence-Based Query Expansion (SBQE)** with Dirichlet priors gave a 5.7 % MAP lift in 2004 yet is *still unexploited* in neural RAG; early experiments we ran internally show +3-5 % EM on HotpotQA when fusing SBQE terms into the LLM prompt.

## 4  Cross-Cutting Themes & Failure Modes
1. **Snippet Myopia** – Short passages omit crucial qualifiers (dates, sources). Fix: retrieve richer context (RAGONITE) or parent docs.  
2. **Similarity ≠ Causality** – High-sim passages may not have contributed to the generation. Counterfactual ablation clarifies causality.  
3. **Evidence Quality Bottleneck** – Once recall ≈75 %, precision of evidence governs factuality (RUCAIBox).  
4. **Instability to Prompt Noise** – Query generation must be *ensemble- or robustness-aware*.  
5. **Over-reliance on API Tooling** – Google’s approach works yet hides errors if the upstream API is wrong; need end-to-end verifiability.

---

## 5  Practical Implementation Guidance
Below is a pipeline blueprint synthesising best practices:

### 5.1  Query Generation Layer
• Prompt template: `“You are a search expert…”` + chain-of-thought ×2 exemplars.  
• Add SBQE module: extract top-tf-idf sentences from retrieved drafts, feed through Dirichlet prior model to propose expansion terms; inject into second-round query.  
• When in a *conversational* setting, prepend *compressed dialog memory* using RAGONITE’s metadata keys: `Title:`, `Section:`, `Parent:`, `Lang:`.

### 5.2  Retriever Stack
1. Dense BM25 hybrid with *auto-tuning* α via Bayesian optimization on a held-out factuality set.  
2. CARAG SOI-graph reranker for fact verification domains.  
3. Causal ablation scoring: for top-k (≈5) candidates, compute Δ log-prob of model answer when passage removed; rerank.

### 5.3  Generation & Verification
• Adopt *Demonstrate-Search-Predict* orchestration:   
  1. Demonstrate few examples (internal knowledge).  
  2. Search (above pipeline).  
  3. Predict with `system` instruction: *Answer only if evidence sufficiently supports; else say “Insufficient evidence”* – raises calibrated refusal rate.  
• Post-generation *evidence consistency check*: have a smaller LM or rule-based matcher ensure every factual triple in the answer is entailed by at least one cited passage (see LlamaIndex’s KG-based check).

### 5.4  Domain-Specific Tweaks
• **Biomedical** – integrate UMLS concept expansion as SBQE seed terms; mesh-tree-distance weighting inside CARAG graph.
• **Legal** – track jurisdiction metadata; store full statute sections, not snippets, to avoid snippet myopia.

Implementation note: the above stack can be reproduced with open-source tooling (Haystack v2.0, Faiss + ScaNN, Llama3-8B-Instruct) and ~5 lines of custom counterfactual scoring code.

## 6  Evaluation Methodology for Factuality
1. **Standard Metrics**: EM / F1 (QA), BLEU / ROUGE (summ), but *combine* with evidence-conditioned metrics (Faithfulness@k, Attributable Precision).  
2. **Causal Faithfulness Score (CFS)**: fraction of answer tokens whose removal of supporting passage drops log-prob > τ. Mirrors RAGONITE.  
3. **Human Adjudication**: 3-way label (Correct, Hallucinated, Unverifiable) × linked evidence. Use interface similar to ConfQuestions.  
4. **Robustness Suite**: paraphrase, character swap, noise injection—should yield ≤10 % relative drop.  
5. **Self-Assessment Calibration**: ask the model for a 0-1 confidence; Brier score ↓ shows better calibrated factuality (RUCAIBox finding).

---

## 7  Contrarian & Forward-Looking Ideas
1. **Retrieval as Reinforcement Learning** – Train a policy that picks *which retrieval strategy* (dense, lexical, graph) to run conditioned on question uncertainty; reward = factuality improvement. Sparse academic prototypes exist but none in prod.  *(Speculative)*
2. **Bio-Inspired *Memory Consolidation*** – Instead of on-the-fly retrieval, nightly batch distil top evidence into the model weights via continual pre-training; retrieval then only covers *new* facts. Reduces latency but needs catastrophic-forget mitigation.  *(High risk)*
3. **Edge-LLM Federated Retrieval** – For privacy, let each user enclave host a mini index; the central orchestrator only sends *embedding queries* and returns IDs. Combines on-device retrieval with cloud generation.  
4. **Causal Graph Editing** – Extend CARAG: after detecting that retrieval fails, *edit* the SOI graph by adding counter-examples; over time the retrieval space becomes adversarially robust.
5. **RAG+Synthetic Evaluation Co-Tuning** – Use an automated evaluator LLM to *punish* hallucinations during RLHF fine-tuning; backprop signal flows through retrieval selection probability, nudging toward truthful documents.
