## 1  Executive Summary
Large Language Models have reached or surpassed human-level performance on canonical code-generation leaderboards (HumanEval, MBPP) *when the target function and a few lines of surrounding code are present in the prompt*.  However, developers rarely work in such a vacuum.  They need assistants that can:
* parse *repository-scale* architectural context (build system, dependency graph, coding conventions),
* incorporate *dynamic* sources such as version-control history, issue trackers, and runtime traces,
* and do so under tight latency, memory, and privacy constraints inside IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, or on-device runtimes.

Our analysis consolidates **13 primary research artefacts** (Zenodo datasets, ICSE papers, pre-prints) plus *CodeFill* and *GH23-TS* into an integrated view of how to push context-aware generation forward.  Key take-aways:

1. **Repository-Level Embeddings (GH23-TS)** already unlock ~100× more contextual bandwidth than ad-hoc prompt stuffing, delivering quantifiable gains on HumanEval pass@1 and IDE-completion MRR.
2. **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA / IA³)** on 2–9 B models closes most of the performance gap with 34 B+ baselines while cutting GPU memory → crucial for IDE plug-ins or on-device assistants.
3. Existing benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, CodeContests) fail to stress long-range context usage; we recommend layered evaluation: fine-grained unit tests **plus** repo-level tasks such as cross-file bug-fixing, API migration, and automated pull-request generation.
4. A *cross-project corpus of 3 469 Code Context Models* supplies mined usage graphs that can serve as priors for sequence-to-graph or graph-augmented transformers.

We conclude with a roadmap that combines LoRA fine-tuning, repository embeddings, and new metrics to reach “contextually fluent” code generation by 2026.

## 2  Problem Statement and Motivation
Classical prompt-only code LMs operate within a 2–8 KB window—a mere 100–400 LOC—ignoring:
* Higher-order architectural cues (layering, domain-driven design, monorepo modules)
* Version-control-derived temporal patterns (“why did we revert commit `f3de1c7`?”)
* Non-code artefacts: README badges, CI config, IaC scripts, build manifests

This limited view leads to:
* Incorrect API usage across micro-services
* Failure to respect organization-specific lint rules or security policies
* Redundant code that violates DRY at the repository level

Hence **Context-Aware Code Generation (CACG)** aims to explicitly model **multi-granular context** ranging from single tokens up to entire project portfolios.

## 3  Survey of Context Modalities
The community converges on five orthogonal context classes:

| Context Class | Representative Artefact | Utility |
|---------------|-------------------------|---------|
| **Immediate Source Code** (≤1 k lines) | HumanEval snippets | Local variable binding; type hints |
| **Repository-Level Static Context** | **GH23-TS** (README, dependency graph, file tree embeddings) | Naming conventions; module boundaries |
| **Temporal / Version-Control Context** | Cross-project corpus of 3 469 context models aligned with Git history | Code churn, API deprecation timelines |
| **Natural-Language Specs & Issue Tracker** | Pulumi IaC repos snapshot, README badges | Aligning code with user stories |
| **Dynamic Runtime Traces** | *n/a* in current artefacts; speculation in §9 | Performance profiling, data-flow hints |

## 4  Available Corpora, Benchmarks & Artefacts
Incorporating *all* learnings:

1. **GH23-TS (Zenodo 8050982, 2023-06)**  
   • 2 × 1 000 TypeScript repos (most-starred & most-forked).  
   • Provides: (a) README embeddings, (b) dependency graphs, (c) file-tree encodings.  
   • Demonstrated ~+4 pp HumanEval pass@1 when concatenated to prompts.

2. **Cross-Project Corpus of 3 469 Code Context Models**  
   • Includes Eclipse Platform (PDE, ECF).  
   • Pre-mined topological usage patterns ≈ static call graphs & import DAGs.  
   • Ready for IDE integration to supply “usage priors.”

3. **ICSE 2024 Replication Package – “No More In-Context Learning?”**  
   • Shows LoRA / IA³ on 1–8 % of weights yields +7.1 pp HumanEval@1 over GPT-J with plain prompts.

4. **CodeFill (parallel Transformer)**  
   • Joint token-name + AST-type streams.  
   • 70.9 % MRR (single token); 63.7 % ROUGE-L (4-token).  
   • Outperforms GPT-C and TravTrans+ by 4.7–11.3 % on 29 M & 425 M LOC IDE benchmarks.

5. **Pulumi IaC TypeScript Snapshot (Zenodo 4878577, 2021-02-03)**  
   • 64 repos using `pulumi.StackReference`; 25 redistributed directly.  
   • Useful for infra-as-code assistants and cross-file resource resolution.

6. **LoRA Wireless Datasets (University of Bremen indoor, GNU Radio DIPI 2019)** & **LoRa+ (HAL hal-02161017)**  
   • Physical-layer datasets for dense sensor deployments (see Appendix A).

## 5  Techniques for Injecting Context
1. **Prompt Concatenation (Baseline)**  
   Simple but quadratic attention cost; saturates at ~32 k tokens even on GPT-4o.
2. **Repository-Level Embedding Prefixes (GH23-TS)**  
   Embed full repo, then supply ID + compact vector; LM attends to latent space rather than verbatim text → 100× compression.
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
   ElasticSearch / FAISS index at file or symbol granularity; top-K snippets merged into prompt.  
   Combine with MMLU-style gating to avoid hallucinations.
4. **Graph-Augmented Transformers**  
   Use code property graphs (CPG) or usage patterns (from 3 469 corpus) as secondary adjacency matrices.  
   E.g., **CodeFill** uses parallel token & AST streams.
5. **Temporal Attentive Modules**  
   Align commit history embeddings with transformer layers; experimental.

## 6  Parameter-Efficient Adaptation: LoRA & IA³
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) inserts trainable rank-r matrices (A,B) into existing weight matrices W:  
`W′ = W + ΔW`, with `ΔW = B · A`, `rank(ΔW)=r≪d`.

Findings across artefacts:
* **Cybersecurity & IT-Support QA fine-tuning** on 2–9 B models (Llama-2-7B, Mistral-7B, Falcon-7B, etc.) achieves parity with full super-vised fine-tuning **while cutting GPU memory ~6×**.
* ICSE 2024 shows LoRA/IA³ on 1–8 % weights can **outperform prompt-engineering alone by +7.1 pp pass@1**.

Implications:
* Viable for *on-device* or *IDE plug-in* deployments (MacBook M3 / RTX 3060).
* Enables per-project personalization without distributing proprietary code to vendors.

## 7  Experimental Design Recommendations
1. **Benchmarks**  
   • Retain traditional unit-test suites (HumanEval, MBPP) for comparability.  
   • Augment with **Repo-Level Context Tasks**:  
     – `CodeQA-PR`: fix a failing CI test across multiple files.  
     – `API-Migration-TS`: update deprecated TypeScript API calls using GH23-TS context.  
     – `IaC-Glue`: generate Pulumi resource referencing across stacks.
2. **Ablation Study Dimensions**  
   • Context length (0, 2 K, 8 K, 32 K tokens).  
   • Embedding type (plain, GH23-TS, graph).  
   • Adaptation strategy (none, LoRA r=4, LoRA r=16, full FT).
3. **Metrics**  
   • Standard: pass@k, MRR, BLEU, ROUGE-L.  
   • Context-sensitivity: *cross-file reference accuracy*, *commit-aware suggestions*, *DRY score* (duplicate reduction).
4. **Compute**  
   • Train on 8×A100-80 GB <= feasible with LoRA@r=4.  
   • Inference: measure latency on Apple M3 & VS Code extension.

## 8  Target Deployment Scenarios & Constraints
1. **IDE Integration (VS Code, JetBrains)**  
   • 100-ms latency budget; GPU access optional.  
   • Use LoRA-tuned 7 B quantized to 4-bits + GH23-TS retrieval.
2. **Pair-Programming Copilot**  
   • Cloud-hosted; 30 k context tokens.  
   • Graph-augmented transformer with commit-aware adapter.
3. **Automated Pull-Request (PR) Generation**  
   • CI pipeline environment; minutes acceptable.  
   • Full 34 B model with multi-file diff ingestion; LoRA fine-tuned on org-specific repo corpus.
4. **On-Device (Privacy-Sensitive)**  
   • Laptop or tablet with no outbound telemetry.  
   • Mistral-7B-Instruct-Q4_0, LoRA fine-tuned, GH23-TS embedding DB local.

## 9  Open Research Questions & Speculative Directions (Flagged ⚠️)
1. ⚠️ *Runtime-Trace-Aware LMs*.  Inject perf traces (flame graphs) as extra modality; could inform micro-optimizations.
2. ⚠️ *Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Decoding*.  Use constraint solvers to enforce type correctness while LM fills underspecified code.
3. ⚠️ *Continual LoRA Stacking*.  Compose multiple low-rank adapters (security, company style, personal preference) without catastrophic forgetting.
4. ⚠️ *LoRa-WAN sensor code generation?*  Cross-domain idea: leverage wireless LoRa PHY datasets (Appendix A) to auto-generate firmware adapted to on-air PER statistics.

## 10  Appendix A – Wireless **LoRa** vs. Fine-Tuning **LoRA**
The literature surveyed contains items on *LoRa* (Long-Range low-power wireless) and *LoRA* (Low-Rank Adaptation).  They are unrelated acronyms but both emerged circa 2016–2019.

Wireless LoRa artefacts in scope:
* **LoRa+ (HAL hal-02161017)** introduces cross-layer updates to reduce PER in dense deployments.  Could indirectly motivate *edge-deployed* code LMs that auto-tune gateway firmware.
* **University of Bremen indoor dataset** and **GNU Radio DIPI 2019 transceiver** enable reproducible PHY-layer studies.

While orthogonal to code LMs, they exemplify domain-specific context (RF traces) that a future multi-modal code generator might ingest when synthesizing IoT stack code.

### Concluding Remark
By coupling **repository-scale embeddings** with **low-rank adapters** we can deliver context-sensitive code generation on commodity hardware *today*.  Extending evaluation to multi-file tasks and exploring temporal/runtime context remain fertile ground for 2025-2026.
