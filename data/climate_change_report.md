## Introduction

The user wants the Introduction section for a report on climate change, using the key findings provided. The key points include the greenhouse effect, human activities' role, impacts on environment and society, the fact-sheet being part of the NCA 2018, and the NCA's purpose as a congressionally mandated report. The user also mentioned including inline citations [1], [2], etc., but the sources aren't provided. Wait, the user might have intended to include sources but didn't list them. Since the sources aren't given, I should note that in the reasoning. Also, the user wants only markdown text and the reasoning. Let me structure the introduction to start with the importance of climate change, mention the NCA 2018 fact-sheet, discuss the greenhouse effect, human activities, impacts, and the report's purpose. Make sure to include the citations as [1], [2], etc., even though the actual sources aren't provided. Need to check if the user wants the citations to be placeholders or actual references. Since they mentioned "matching the numbered sources below" but there are no sources listed, I'll assume they want placeholders. Alright, putting it all together now.
Okay, the user

## Methods

The user wants the Methods section for a report on climate change, using the key findings provided. The key points include the greenhouse effect, human activities' role, impacts on environment and society, the fact-sheet being part of the NCA 2018, and the NCA's purpose as a congressionally mandated report. The user also mentioned including inline citations [1], [2], etc., but the sources aren't provided. Wait, the user might have intended to include sources but didn't list them. Since the sources aren't given, I should note that in the reasoning. Also, the Methods section should describe the methodology used in the report. However, the provided key findings don't mention specific methodologies like data collection, models, or analysis techniques. The user might be expecting a general Methods section based on the content of the fact-sheet and NCA. So, I need to infer that the Methods section would describe the compilation of existing data, literature review, analysis of greenhouse gas emissions, climate models, and assessment of impacts. Since the NCA is a congressionally mandated report, the Methods might involve interdisciplinary collaboration, data synthesis, and stakeholder input. I should structure the Methods section to include these elements, even

## Results

The user wants the Results section of a report on climate change, using the key findings provided. The key points include the greenhouse effect, human activities' role, impacts on environment and society, the fact-sheet being part of the NCA 2018, and the NCA's purpose as a congressionally mandated report. The user also mentioned including inline citations [1], [2], etc., but the sources aren't listed. Wait, the user provided a list of key findings, but no specific sources. Maybe they expect me to use the NCA 2018 as the source, so I can cite it as [1]. Let me structure the Results section with the bullet points given. Start with the greenhouse effect, then human activities, then impacts. Mention the NCA 2018 fact-sheet and its role in the report. Make sure to include the congressionally mandated aspect. Also, the user mentioned the chapter concludes with implications for society. Need to integrate that. Since the sources aren't provided, I'll use [1] for the NCA 2018. Let me check if all key points are covered. Greenhouse effect, human activities, environmental and societal impacts, N

## Discussion

The user wants the Discussion section for a report on climate change, using the key findings provided. The key points include the greenhouse effect, human activities, impacts on environment and society, the fact-sheet being part of the NCA 2018, and the NCA's role as a congressionally mandated report. The user also mentioned including inline citations [1], [2], etc., but the sources aren't provided. Wait, the user might have intended to include sources but forgot to list them. Since the sources aren't provided, I should note that in the reasoning. Also, the user wants only markdown text and the reasoning. Let me structure the Discussion section by first introducing the NCA 2018 fact-sheet, then discussing the greenhouse effect, human activities, environmental and societal impacts, and the importance of adaptation strategies. Make sure to mention the congressionally mandated aspect of the NCA. Since there are no sources, I'll use placeholders like [1], [2], etc., as per the user's request. Need to ensure the flow is logical and covers all key points. Also, check for any missing information from the snippet, like the conclusion about implications for society. Alright, let's draft the

## Conclusion

The user wants the conclusion section for a report on climate change, using the key findings provided. The key points include the greenhouse effect, human activities, impacts on environment and society, the fact-sheet being part of the NCA 2018, and the NCA's role as a congressionally mandated report. The user also mentioned including inline citations [1], [2], etc., but the sources aren't listed here. Wait, the user might have intended to include sources but didn't provide them. Since the original query didn't list sources, maybe the citations are placeholders. I need to make sure to include them as [1], [2], etc., even if the actual sources aren't specified. The conclusion should tie together the key points, emphasizing the importance of the NCA's findings, the role of human activities, and the need for mitigation and adaptation strategies. Also, mention the implications for society and the environment. I should structure the conclusion to summarize the main points, highlight the significance of the NCA report, and perhaps suggest the need for continued research and action. Let me check the key findings again to ensure all are covered. Greenhouse effect, human activities, environmental and societal impacts, NCA 2
