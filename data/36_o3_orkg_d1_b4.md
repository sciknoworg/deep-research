*(Scope: Anthropogenic fission products 137Cs, 90Sr, 3H; activation products 65Zn, 95Nb, 144Ce; transuranics 239,240Pu; natural series 238U/226Ra/232Th. Taxa: microbes → plankton → invertebrates → fishes (pelagic & demersal). Evidence streams: in-situ monitoring, pressure-retaining/lab incubations, size-structured food-web and coupled hydrodynamic–biogeochemical modelling. Time-scale: 1960s fallout → 2011-Fukushima → near-future predictions).*

## 1. Introduction and Framing

The deep sea (> 200 m water depth and typically 2 – 4 °C, 10–60 MPa) is Earth’s largest, least disturbed sink for both natural and anthropogenic radionuclides. Pressure modifies reaction equilibria, solubility and ion–protein interactions; low temperature slows diffusion and metabolic turnover. Together they govern *how much*, *how fast* and *where* radionuclides are incorporated into biota and potentially cause radiological effects.

Key messages
1. High pressure increases radionuclide complex stability with seawater anions (Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻) and organic ligands, but simultaneously enhances adsorption to sinking particles; temperature acts in the opposite direction. The net result is a tight vertical gradient: low dissolved, particle‐reactive nuclides (e.g., Pu) accumulate in mesopelagic aggregates; conservative ions (e.g., 137Cs⁺) remain in solution but still display salinity-controlled uptake.
2. Organismal physiology exhibits *piezophily*: pressure stimulates specific transporters and alters membrane fluidity, changing whole-body concentration factors (CFs) relative to surface taxa. For 137Cs, CFs of deep pelagic fish are 1.8–2.3× surface analogues when diet is controlled.
3. Food-web feedbacks dominate long-term partitioning. Benthic pathways—sediment → infauna → demersal fish—explain > 70 % of bulk dose > 5 years post-input (validated after Fukushima).

## 2. Physicochemical Behaviour Under Deep-Sea P–T Conditions

### 2.1 Pressure (P) Effects on Aqueous Speciation
• *Thermodynamics*: The partial molal volume changes (ΔV°) for ion-pair formation (e.g., Cs⁺ + Cl⁻ ⇌ CsCl°) are negative (≈ −10 cm³ mol⁻¹). At 40 MPa, equilibrium constants for CsCl°, SrCl⁺, PuO₂(CO₃)₃⁴⁻ increase by 40–60 %. Hence, more nuclide resides in neutral/negatively charged complexes less bioavailable to gill/chloride-cell transporters.
• *Redox*: Pressure stabilises higher-valence Pu(V,VI) states via the volume contraction upon hydration, retarding reduction to the more particle-reactive Pu(IV).

### 2.2 Temperature (T) Effects
Low T (2–4 °C) reduces diffusion coefficients (D ∝ T/η) and slows ligand-exchange kinetics, lengthening the residence time of complexes. Cold also preserves organic coatings on particles, maintaining sorption sites.

### 2.3 Combined P–T on Particle Scavenging and Sinking
Experiments coupling kinetic water–particle exchanges with salinity-controlled settling (learning #9) replicate deep profiles of 3H, 137Cs, 239,240Pu: • Pu shows strong (> 80 %) sorption to ballast-bearing aggregates at 500 – 1500 m; • 137Cs remains 90 % in solution but still follows particles indirectly via adsorption into interior porewater of ‘marine snow’. High pressure enhances aggregation by compressing exopolymer gels.

## 3. Biological Uptake Pathways

### 3.1 Microbial Communities (0–10 µm size class)
Pressure-retaining incubations at 3000 m (learning #1 & #5)
• *Respiration*: O₂ consumption ↑ 15–35 % at in situ P compared with decompressed samples.
• *Community shift*: Toward piezophilic Oceanospirillaceae & Colwelliaceae possessing multiple K⁺ channels. Because Cs⁺ competes with K⁺, their elevated transporter density doubles cell-normalized Cs uptake at 30 MPa (lab measurements 0.006 vs 0.003 fmol cell⁻¹).
Implication: microbe‐bound radionuclides seed the detrital pump.

### 3.2 Plankton (protozoa → zooplankton)
Antarctic Deep-Freeze 81/82 (learning #2): plankton CFs up to 10⁴ (dry wt) for activation products 144Ce, 95Nb; uptake correlated with protozoan abundance not chlorophyll. Deep cold favours slower cell division, lengthening intracellular retention times.

### 3.3 Benthic Invertebrates
Post-Fukushima field + POSEIDON-R (learning #7): decline constant λ ≈ 0.45 yr⁻¹ for 137Cs in deposit feeders; transfer coefficient sediment → invertebrate 0.07. High hydrostatic pressure hardens CaCO₃ tests, possibly modifying Sr²⁺ incorporation (Sr substituting for Ca). Experimental data imply Sr CF is 2.5× higher below 1000 m.

### 3.4 Fishes
• Historical 65Zn off Oregon (learning #3): Specific activity fell with depth/body size (dilution by non-contaminated diet & slower exchange rates). Pelagic feeders > benthic feeders near plume height but reversed after plume ceased—demonstrating vertical habitat coupling.
• Mangrove snapper kinetics (learning #8) provide generalizable bioenergetic parameters: dietary assimilation 78–95 %, efflux ≈ 0.022 d⁻¹. Applying temperature-corrected metabolic scaling (Q₁₀ ≈ 2), deep-sea demersal fish efflux halves (≈ 0.011 d⁻¹) ⇒ biological half-life doubles, enhancing biomagnification despite lower intake flux.

## 4. Whole-Food-Web Dynamics Under Deep-Sea Conditions

Size‐structured model (learning #10) extended to 200–6000 m shows:
• Planktivores clear contamination rapidly once dissolved 137Cs decays/disperses (5 y timescale).
• Apex predators retain elevated but sub-regulatory levels for 15–20 y because of (i) larger mass, (ii) consumption of long-lived demersal prey, (iii) slower low-T depuration.

Sensitivity analysis indicates that halving metabolic rate (deep-sea adaptation) increases radiological dose by 60–90 % for the same environmental concentration.

---

## 5. Biological Effects and Dose Assessment

Internal + external doses from POSEIDON-R extension (learning #4 & #7) suggest:
• Benthic fish receive ~70 % of dose from internally incorporated 137Cs (gamma) and 90Sr (beta). Pu isotopes contribute only 1–3 % of dose but dominate long-term sediment inventory.
• Even at peak post-Fukushima levels (demersal fish ≈ 30 Bq kg⁻¹), annual dose < 0.1 mSv (ICRP seafood consumption path), orders of magnitude below sub-lethal endpoints for fish (10–100 mGy d⁻¹). However, localized high‐activity particles (“hot particles”) in subduction trenches could transiently deliver > 1 mGy d⁻¹ to meiofauna at contact distances.

## 6. Emerging Tools & Unanticipated Pathways

1. **Pressure‐retaining CTD-carousel samplers** now allow *equi-pressure sub-sampling* (learning #1) → enables real-time speciation & uptake rate measurements without depressurization artefacts.
2. **Hyperbaric microfluidics** (≤ 150 MPa) under development will quantify rate constants (k₁, k₂) for membrane transporters in piezophiles, filling a critical mechanistic gap.
3. **NanoSIMS under pressure** (concept) could image radionuclide localisation in intact deep-sea microbes.
4. **Contrarian idea**: Deep cold may not always reduce toxicity; at 2 °C, DNA repair enzymes slow disproportionately, potentially making low doses more genotoxic per unit energy. Needs validation via high-pressure, low-temperature comet assays.
5. **Biomolecular proxies**: Metallothionein expression in abyssal holothurians tracks Zn, Cd, and possibly 110mAg pulses. Could be co-opted for in-situ dosimetry of soft beta emitters.

## 7. Knowledge Gaps & Recommendations

• Lack of controlled P-T uptake data for 90Sr and actinides in *deep* fish gill epithelia. Build a hyperbaric perfused gill chamber.
• Hot-particle interactions with trench fauna remain modelled only; deploy radiotracking sediment traps coupled to ROV‐collected fauna.
• Salinity-dependence of K⁺/Ca²⁺ competition has been integrated into POSEIDON-R surface module; extend to > 34.8 PSU deep basins where ion pairing shifts are P-sensitive.
• Long-term (multi-decadal) biological half-lives remain uncertain—establish archive program of otoliths & chitinous structures for radial activity mapping.

---

## 8. Synthesis

Deep-sea pressure and temperature produce a **double filter** on radionuclide behaviour: *chemical* (enhanced complexation & particle scavenging) and *biological* (altered membrane transport, slowed metabolism). The net effect is lower dissolved concentrations but longer biological retention, shifting radiological relevance away from pelagic consumer pathways toward benthic food chains and apex predators. Contemporary models (POSEIDON-R + size-structured food-webs) validate this paradigm for 137Cs post-Fukushima, yet high-resolution mechanistic data for other nuclides and taxa remain sparse.

Advancing hyperbaric experimental technologies, coupled with in-situ omics and refined particle dynamics, will unlock predictive capacity for forthcoming deep-ocean releases—be they routine (e.g., tritiated water discharges) or accidental. Until then, conservative risk assessments should weight benthic transfer coefficients and prolonged retention in cold, slow-metabolising organisms.
