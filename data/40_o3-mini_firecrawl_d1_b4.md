This report synthesizes extensive research on the subject of soil biota and their multifaceted interactions with plant diversity in Central European calcareous soils. Our investigation compiles evidence from temporal analyses, species-specific interactions, abiotic mediation, disturbance impacts, and advanced modelling techniques. The following sections provide a detailed exploration of the key findings and their implications, drawing from a consensus of multiple studies, long-term experiments, and modern analytical approaches.

## 1. Introduction

Calcareous soils, characterized by high pH levels and distinctive chemical properties, provide a unique context in Central Europe for studying plant–soil interactions. Soil biota—including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), bacteria, nematodes, and earthworms—play crucial roles in nutrient cycling, environmental stress buffering, and plant community assembly. A deep understanding of these interactions is vital for both conservation and adaptive management of these ecologically sensitive habitats.

This report converges findings from multiple research strands to address the primary query: *What is known about the effects of soil biota on plant diversity in calcareous soils in Central Europe?* Specific attention is paid to the timing of interactions, species-specific responses, the interplay between abiotic and biotic drivers, and the emergent patterns from spatial and temporal analyses.

## 2. Temporal Dynamics and Successional Interactions

Research indicates that plant–soil biota interactions are strongly time-dependent. Early in community establishment, **priority effects** manifest wherein fast-establishing, early-colonizer species can suppress the establishment of slow-growing target species. Key observations include:

- **Short-Term Dynamics (0–2 Years):** Rapid colonization by early-successional species has been shown to initially suppress soil biotic communities that promote later species. However, even before the establishment of longer-term soil processes, the presence of these early colonizers can set the stage for subsequent soil community composition.

- **Mid- to Long-Term Dynamics (4–6 Years):** Enhanced plant species richness increasingly correlates with boosted decomposer and microbial communities. This leads to conditions conducive to the successful establishment of slow-growing target species. The delay in positive feedback effects from plant diversity underscores the value of long-term observational studies in detecting the maturation of plant–soil feedback (PSF) cycles.

These findings underscore that the window of observation is critical when assessing the influence of soil biota on plant diversity. Early interactions might reflect competitive exclusion, while longer observation periods highlight mutualistic and facilitative interactions that increase overall biodiversity.

## 3. Role of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF)

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are pivotal in calcareous soils, particularly where nutrient availability can limit plant growth. Studies have shown that AMF:

- **Enhance Nutrient Uptake:** By improving phosphorus uptake, AMF mitigate limitations often seen in calcareous soils. This beneficial association is essential, particularly in soils with pH levels that can precipitate or immobilize nutrients.

- **Modulate Soil Conditions:** Beyond nutrient uptake, AMF are implicated in modifying soil pH and water retention characteristics. These modifications offer plants enhanced stress tolerance against drought, pathogens, and metal toxicity.

- **Species- and Context-Dependent Impacts:** The effects of AMF are not uniform; rather, they vary according to both the plant species involved and the broader soil context. This necessitates a nuanced approach when considering plant–soil interactions.

Given their centrality, future research should carefully disaggregate the specific AMF species and strains in use, as they may confer different benefits or impose different trade-offs, particularly under shifting climate conditions or in the face of soil management regimes.

## 4. Influence of Abiotic Soil Properties

Calcareous soils inherently exhibit unique abiotic features such as high pH, specific mineral composition, and distinct organic matter profiles. Evidence suggests that these factors mediate the relationship between soil biota and plant diversity:

- **Microbial Biomass and Activity:** In long-term experiments on post-mining calcareous soils in regions such as the Silesian Upland, it was observed that microbial biomass and activity are driven more robustly by soil chemical properties (e.g., nutrient availability, organic matter content, pH) than by plant diversity alone. This suggests that intrinsic soil characteristics set the baseline conditions within which biotic interactions occur.

- **Threshold Effects Related to Soil Compaction:** Empirical studies reveal that a bulk density threshold (around 1.7 to 1.8 g/cm³) can significantly limit microbial processes. When soils reach or exceed these compaction thresholds, microbial biomass declines and key biological processes are compromised. These thresholds serve as important management indicators for soil restoration and conservation in fragile calcareous environments.

These relationships indicate that any conservation or adaptive management strategy must take into account the baseline abiotic conditions before attributing changes in plant diversity solely to biotic interactions.

## 5. Impacts of Disturbance and Environmental Stressors

The dynamics of soil biota and plant diversity are further complicated by disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic:

- **Fire and Acid Deposition:** Such disturbances can abruptly reset or redirect PSF processes. For instance, fire-induced thermal damage can decimate vital soil biota, while acid deposition increases the toxicity of specific ions like H+ and Al3+. These immediate, direct effects combine with indirect modulation of soil moisture and nutrient availability, leading to altered microbial and nematode community structures.

- **Soil Acidification in Semi-Arid Grasslands:** Controlled additions of H+ have provided insights, demonstrating a marked decline in soil pH and shifts in key nutrient cycling processes, such as nitrogen mineralization. These studies report reduced plant species richness and productivity at high levels of acidification, emphasizing the sensitivity of soil biotic communities and their associated nutrient dynamics in calcareous systems.

Given that disturbances can both initiate and reset biotic processes, management practices must factor in not just the recovery trajectories of plants, but also the reestablishment of critical soil biota in post-disturbance landscapes.

## 6. Management Regimes and Anthropogenic Influences

Several management practices directly influence the composition and functionality of soil biota:

- **Grazing Regimes:** Grazing can exert a negative pressure on sensitive plant species, potentially mediated by changes in soil biotic communities. The outcomes are mediated by both direct physical disturbance and indirect shifts in soil nutrient and moisture profiles.

- **Nitrogen Deposition:** Excessive nitrogen deposition, often a byproduct of industrial and agricultural activities, has notable impacts on the cover and composition of plant species, particularly those that are sensitive to changes in nutrient inputs. This, in turn, modulates soil biota communities through altered soil chemistry.

- **Phylogenetic Relatedness and Range Expansion:** An intriguing finding is that plant–soil interactions are mediated by phylogenetic relatedness. For example, range-expanders with native congeners tend to modify soil communities similarly to native species, whereas those without closely related natives might foster unique biotic assemblages. However, the competitive outcomes are not always predictable, indicating a complex interplay between plant identity, historical contingency, and soil community structure.

These findings indicate robust interactions between anthropogenically driven changes and soil biota dynamics, thus necessitating adaptive management strategies that integrate both biotic and abiotic factors.

## 7. Modelling Approaches and Quantitative Analyses

The complexity of plant–soil feedback mechanisms in heterogeneous calcareous soils demands sophisticated analytical techniques:

- **Hierarchical Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling (HB-SEM):** This advanced approach has proven effective in quantifying and separating measurement uncertainties from true ecological signals. Such modelling enables researchers to understand the direct and indirect pathways through which soil biota impact plant diversity, accounting for both spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability.

- **Spatio-Temporal Analysis:** Multi-year monitoring combined with structural equation modelling has revealed that seasonal dynamics account for nearly all variability in plant cover change (>99%). In contrast, spatial variability explains a significantly lower fraction (∼38%). This finding emphasizes the predominance of temporal rather than spatial processes in driving plant community dynamics in these systems.

These advanced modelling strategies not only enhance the precision of ecological assessments but also inform adaptive management practices. By accurately attributing variations in plant diversity to specific biotic and abiotic drivers, these approaches pave the way for targeted interventions in the conservation and restoration of species-rich calcareous grasslands.

## 8. Specific Contributions of Soil Fauna: Nematodes and Earthworms

Beyond the microbial component, soil fauna such as nematodes and earthworms add additional layers of complexity to plant–soil interactions:

- **Nematodes:** The community structure of soil nematodes is sensitive to both plant species identity and abiotic soil conditions. In studies comparing different tree species (e.g., beech versus ash), distinct shifts were noted in trophic indices such as Shannon diversity and maturity index, reflecting divergent nutrient cycling and decomposition pathways. Nematode responses offer an integrated indicator of soil health and the quality of plant–soil interactions.

- **Earthworms:** Earthworms exert a dual influence on soil ecosystems. On one hand, they reduce overall nematode abundance—particularly targeting bacterivores and omnivores, with reductions documented between 30 and 70% in specific treatments. On the other hand, their presence increases nematode genus richness and contributes to enhanced soil organic carbon accumulation. Their activity therefore indirectly influences nutrient mineralization rates and overall plant productivity.

This duality underscores the need for a fine-grained understanding of soil fauna contributions, which may support the development of biotic enhancement techniques in restoration ecology.

## 9. Integrative Insights and Future Research Directions

The integrative body of research reviewed here highlights several key insights:

- **Temporal Shifts Are Paramount:** Effective management and conservation of calcareous grasslands require long-term monitoring, as early colonization dynamics differ significantly from later-stage mutualistic interactions.

- **Abiotic Conditions Set the Stage:** Inherent soil properties, particularly pH, organic matter content, and bulk density, moderate the benefits conferred by soil biota. Adaptive management must, therefore, address these underlying edaphic characteristics.

- **Species-Specific and Context-Dependent Effects:** The roles of AMF, nematodes, and earthworms differ not only by their direct interactions with plants but also by their responses to abiotic stressors. Future studies should aim to elucidate the mechanistic bases for these differences, potentially employing omics techniques and high-resolution spatial mapping.

- **The Necessity of Advanced Modelling:** Utilizing methods such as hierarchical Bayesian structural equation modelling enhances our ability to parse out complex interactions. Integrating spatial and temporal models can further refine our understanding of plant–soil feedbacks in these heterogeneous ecosystems.

- **Multidisciplinary Management Approaches:** Adaptive management strategies should be multidisciplinary—incorporating soil physics, microbial ecology, plant biology, and atmospheric sciences to address multifaceted stressors like grazing, nitrogen deposition, and disturbances such as fire or acid deposition.

- **Potential for Applications of Emerging Technologies:** There is potential for applying remote sensing for real-time monitoring of vegetation changes linked with soil biota dynamics, coupled with IoT-based soil sensor networks that provide continuous data on pH, moisture, and nutrient levels. Such technologies could revolutionize adaptive management practices by linking direct field measurements with predictive modelling in real-time.

## 10. Conclusion

The effects of soil biota on plant diversity in Central European calcareous soils are complex and highly context-dependent. Temporal dynamics reveal a shift from competitive exclusion in early colonization to enhanced facilitative interactions as ecosystems mature. Key biotic players, notably AMF, nematodes, and earthworms, interact with intrinsic soil properties and external disturbances to shape plant community structure. Advanced modelling approaches have been crucial in elucidating these dynamics, indicating that both abiotic and biotic factors are indispensable in mediating plant diversity.

In conclusion, conservation and management strategies should embrace a multifaceted approach that integrates soil physical, chemical, and biological data. Future research should continue to refine our understanding of these relationships, especially in light of emerging environmental challenges and technological innovations. Addressing these complexities will be critical for preserving the unique biodiversity of Central European calcareous grasslands.
