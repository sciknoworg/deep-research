# Final Report: The Interdependent Relationship between Biodiversity and Health

## Executive Summary

The convergence of biodiversity and health research reveals a complex interplay that is crucial for both human and ecosystem well-being. In our integrative review, detailed learnings from multiple interdisciplinary studies were synthesized to elucidate how biodiversity influences health outcomes across both material and non-material dimensions. This report discusses the multifaceted relationships—from the benefits conferred by nature to the potential risks posed by biodiversity loss. In doing so, it emphasizes the need for integrative, cross-sectoral approaches such as the One Health perspective, robust causal frameworks, and transformative policy interventions. The report is structured into several sections starting with theoretical underpinnings, empirical evidences, mechanistic pathways, and culminating with policy implications and solutions for harmonizing biodiversity conservation with health promotion.

## 1. Introduction

Over recent decades the nexus between biodiversity and health has garnered increased attention, primarily due to its implications for public health, ecosystem services, and economic development. From tropical rainforests to riverine ecosystems, biodiversity data is essential to unlock the benefits that underlie several critical human needs—food security, natural medicine, mental well-being, and even the regulation of infectious diseases. The key challenge lies in conceptualizing biodiversity not merely as an ecological measure but as an essential determinant of health that requires integrated management and policy frameworks.

The key question driving modern research is: How does biodiversity affect human health outcomes at both the macro and micro scales, and what are the underlying mechanisms? The inquiry extends from investigating genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity to understanding the spatial, functional, and perceived components that link environmental balance to community well-being. This report synthesizes learnings drawn from multiple research studies, highlighting integrative approaches and novel causal models that map the relationships between biodiversity and health.

## 2. Theoretical and Conceptual Frameworks

### 2.1 One Health and Beyond

The integrative ‘One Health’ concept forms the cornerstone for many of the studies reviewed. One Health advocates for merging human, animal, and environmental health perspectives to manage the complex scale‐dependent dynamics of biodiversity–disease relationships. This approach not only facilitates a comprehensive understanding of disease transmission but also prompts the design of effective and sustainable policies that protect both human well–being and natural ecosystems.

### 2.2 Conceptual Pathways Linking Biodiversity and Health

A recent conceptual framework distinguishes four key pathways in the linkage between biodiversity and human health:

- **Reducing Harm:** Through nature’s provision of medicines, as well as supporting air and water purification, biodiversity can help mitigate adverse health risks.
- **Restoring Capacities:** Exposure to natural environments fosters stress reduction and cognitive restoration, with green spaces offering significant mental health benefits.
- **Building Capacities:** Biodiversity, by facilitating physical activities and positive social experiences, can enhance overall resilience and community cohesion.
- **Causing Harm:** Conversely, biodiversity loss may lead to an increase in zoonotic spillovers or allergenic exposures by disrupting ecological balances, thus posing direct health threats.

This framework, which integrates ecological, epidemiological, and social data, is supported by evidence across diverse geographic contexts—from high-biodiversity tropical settings to temperate zones with less species richness.

## 3. Empirical Evidence and Mechanistic Insights

### 3.1 Ecosystem Services and Health Outcomes

Global correlational studies underscore a strong positive correlation between biodiversity distribution and the provisioning of essential ecosystem services. Notably:

- **Food Security and Genetic Diversity:** Pollinators and crop genetic diversity benefit significantly from high biodiversity areas, especially in tropical regions where biodiversity is at its peak. This ensures stable food production and improved resistance to pests and diseases.
- **Medicinal Resources:** Many natural compounds derived from diverse ecosystems have been critical in modern pharmacology. Biodiversity loss can undermine the availability of these resources, jeopardizing the discovery of new medicines.
- **Mental Health and Well-being:** Exposure to natural, biodiverse environments is linked with improved psychological health outcomes, such as reduced stress levels and enhanced cognitive function. Although causal mechanisms are partly understood, the non‐material benefits of nature—such as attention restoration and social cohesion—are well documented.

### 3.2 Mechanistic Pathways and Causal Models

Recent studies using causal modelling techniques like piecewise Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) have provided insights into how environmental variables directly and indirectly modulate biodiversity metrics. Findings from these models demonstrate:

- **Direct Environmental Effects:** Environmental variables summarized via PCA have similar magnitudes of effect on ecosystem functioning as do biodiversity variables, highlighting that management must address both environmental stressors and biodiversity conservation simultaneously.
- **Antagonistic Effects in Riverine Ecosystems:** Field-based evidence indicates that while increased intraspecific (genetic) diversity tends to enhance ecosystem functions such as productivity, increased interspecific (species) diversity may, under certain trophic conditions, reduce these processes. These antagonistic effects stress the need for nuanced management strategies that consider the specific context of biodiversity metrics.

### 3.3 Biodiversity in Relation to Disease Transmission

Biodiversity’s role in mitigating or enhancing disease transmission mechanisms has emerged as a significant area of study:

- **The Dilution Effect:** Biodiversity can reduce disease risk by dispersing and diluting pathogen loads among diverse species, thereby lowering the chances of any single species amplifying disease outbreaks. This is particularly relevant in contexts where zoonotic diseases are prevalent.
- **Risk of Zoonotic Spillover:** Conversely, biodiversity loss may lead to an increase in fast-reproducing reservoir species that serve as vectors for infectious diseases such as malaria, leptospirosis, and scrub typhus. Habitat destruction, urbanization, and other anthropogenic pressures further exacerbate these risks.

## 4. Integrating Biodiversity Data into Health and Policy Planning

### 4.1 Monitoring, Modelling, and Data Integration

Broad-scale assessments, such as those informed by the IPBES Global Assessment Report, identify the urgent need for integrating spatial, genetic, and functional biodiversity data into public health and conservation planning. Remote sensing, citizen science initiatives, and novel data integrations are increasingly pivotal for monitoring ecological indicators that directly affect human health outcomes.

### 4.2 Policy Frameworks and Transformative Solutions

Robust policy frameworks that mainstream biodiversity considerations into global health strategies are already in development by organizations like the GEF and WHO. These interventions focus on:

- **Monitoring and Mitigation:** Implementing indicators to track ecosystem health and adopting nature‐based solutions becomes crucial to offset the adverse effects of climate change, habitat degradation, and intensive agriculture.
- **Cross-Sectoral Interventions:** By aligning strategies across public health, environmental protection, and agricultural innovation, these frameworks aim to address biodiversity loss via a holistic lens.
- **Leveraging Integrated Evidence:** The causal and correlational evidence linking biodiversity to both protective and harmful health outcomes supports the need for integrated policy-making. Incorporating detailed ecological data into these policies will facilitate adaptive management strategies that can respond dynamically to changing ecosystems.

### 4.3 Innovations and Future Directions

Beyond conventional approaches, several innovative avenues deserve exploration:

- **Citizen Science and Crowdsourced Data:** Engaging the public in biodiversity monitoring could enhance spatial and temporal resolution in ecological data collection, thereby improving predictive modelling related to health outcomes.
- **Advanced Causal Modelling:** Continued development of piecewise SEM and other advanced causal models will help disentangle the complex direct and indirect effects of environmental variables and biodiversity on ecosystem services and health outcomes.
- **Artificial Intelligence and Big Data:** Leveraging AI to synthesize vast datasets—including genetic, spatial, and functional biodiversity metrics—could support real-time decision-making in public health and environmental conservation.
- **Health Impact Assessments:** Systematic incorporation of biodiversity indices into health impact assessments (HIAs) could further refine our understanding of how regional biodiversity loss translates into specific health risks.

## 5. Challenges and Solutions

Although the empirical evidence largely supports the positive role of biodiversity in sustaining ecosystem services and human health, several challenges remain:

### 5.1 Complexity and Non-linear Dynamics

Environmental changes driven by anthropogenic forces produce non‐linear and multiscale interactions among biodiversity levels and disease transmission dynamics. Addressing these complexities requires:

- **Modelling Multiscale Interactions:** Integrative modelling efforts that encompass multiple trophic levels and incorporate non-linear dynamics can provide a more nuanced understanding of ecosystem functionality.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Future research should continue to bridge disciplines, leveraging ecological theory, epidemiology, socio-economics, and computational modelling to produce comprehensive frameworks.

### 5.2 Data Gaps and Measurement Issues

There is still limited resolution in understanding how specific types of biodiversity (genetic, species, ecosystem) contribute differentially to health outcomes:

- **Expanding Measurement Metrics:** Initiatives that integrate remote sensing, advanced GIS mapping, and on-the-ground biodiversity assessments must be scaled to ensure comprehensive data capture.
- **Precision Public Health:** Tailoring public health interventions to locally-specific biodiversity profiles can minimize risks and maximize ecosystem benefits.

### 5.3 Policy Integration and Implementation

Transforming scientific insights into actionable policies is fraught with challenges due to administrative, jurisdictional, and cross-sectoral barriers:

- **Framework Standardization:** Adopting unified policy frameworks such as those endorsed by WHO and the GEF is critical to ensuring consistency in approach across regions and sectors.
- **Enhanced Stakeholder Engagement:** Active involvement of local communities, policymakers, and industries in data collection, interpretation, and decision-making processes can facilitate smoother policy implementation and foster broader acceptance of integrated strategies.

## 6. Conclusion

This detailed review underscores that biodiversity underpins human health through a confluence of ecosystem services, causative and protective pathways, and socio-environmental interactions. The loss of biodiversity not only diminishes essential services—such as air and water purification, provision of medicinal resources, and psychological benefits—but also increases the risk of emerging infectious diseases and other health hazards. The key to harnessing nature’s benefits while mitigating risks lies in adopting integrative frameworks like One Health, supporting robust causal modelling, and fostering cross-sectoral policy solutions that embed biodiversity conservation into public health planning.

In summary, the intricate links between biodiversity and health demand innovative, adaptive management approaches that simultaneously prioritize ecological integrity and human well-being. Future research should continue exploring these interdependencies, expanding on advanced data integration techniques and engaging multidisciplinary perspectives to optimize both conservation and health outcomes.
