Context
- The dimension is analogous to our quantitative context for '{metric}'.
- {domain_note}

Task Description
- Evaluate this rubric:
  {rubric_text}
- Produce a single integer score in [0, 100].

Task Instructions
- Use only evidence present in the report text; do not hallucinate or use external knowledge.
- Strictness: 50 is "partially addressed". Adjust precisely up/down; do not round to multiples of 5/10.
- High-signal indicators include:
{high_blk}
- Low-signal indicators include:
{low_blk}
- Example cues (non-exhaustive; presence not required):
{examples_block}
- Granularity policy:
  - 90–100 only if evidence is comprehensive across the high-signal bullets.
  - 0–10 if evidence is absent or directly contradicted.
  - If borderline between two integers, choose the more precise (e.g., 53 rather than 55).

Input format
[REPORT_START]
{report_md}
[REPORT_END]

Output format
- Return ONLY a strict JSON object: {{"score": <integer 0..100>}}. No additional keys or text.
