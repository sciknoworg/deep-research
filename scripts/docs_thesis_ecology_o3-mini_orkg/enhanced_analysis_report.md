## 🌿 Ecology-Specific Notes
- Coverage uses unique-hit ratio vs. dictionary size (no frequency inflation).
- Rigor excludes citations; focuses on stats lexicon & uncertainty signals.
- No taxonomy enters the score; prevents correlation with depth/breadth.

## 🔬 Methodological Notes
- Arithmetic aggregation only; no harmonic means.
- Dimensions: Depth, Breadth, Rigor, Innovation, Ecological relevance, Info density.
- Coverage = unique term hits / dictionary size (clipped to [0,1]).
- CSV also includes the raw `sources_per_1k` used by your density panels.
